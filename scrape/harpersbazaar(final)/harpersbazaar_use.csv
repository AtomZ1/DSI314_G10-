The Best Jewelry from Amazon's Luxury Stores,"Usually, when Phoebe Bridgers talks about the moon, she's singing to a group of crying fans (I am, admittedly, one of them) who are mouthing the words to her ""Moon Song."" But last week, she could be found talking about astronomy in a not-heart-wrenching context—while wearing Chanel jewelry inspired by the stars. Standing underneath a crescent moon on a stage in Los Angeles, she introduced the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who were performing for Chanel’s guests at a dinner celebrating the launch of the 1932 jewelry collection, which is the second one ever released by the brand. The crowd cheered, but the 18-karat Coco Crush earrings and bracelet adorning Bridgers’s earlobes and wrist were beautiful enough that they could have elicited tears (of jealousy). Phoebe Bridgers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinIt has been 90 years since Gabrielle Chanel designed Bijoux de Diamants, the first high jewelry collection in history. It was created three years after Black Thursday pushed the world into the Great Depression, and Chanel was determined to create something that could shine through the turmoil. The 50-piece collection was made of white and yellow diamonds set in platinum and yellow gold, with 22 pieces inspired by specific constellations. “Nothing could be better for forgetting the crisis than feasting one’s eyes on beautiful new things,” she said of the collection. And so it feels fitting that in 2022, nearly three years after the entire world stood still for the pandemic, the fashion house she built would respond to our somber times with something just as sumptuous.More From Harper's BAZAARThe Yeah Yeah Yeahs performing at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinLike the original Bijoux de Diamants collection, the design of 1932 is harmonized around three symbols: the comet, the moon, and the sun. Chanel muses like Marion Cotillard, Lori Harvey, Greta Lee, and Whitney Peak were in attendance at the West Hollywood celebration, and, like Bridgers, were also layered in pieces from the 1932 collection named after the cosmos. Maggie Rogers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection. Pat MartinSinger Maggie Rogers, who also recently graduated from Harvard’s Divinity School, wore five rings from the collection but said the shooting star Comète ear cuff in 18-karat gold was her favorite. On the Chanel black carpet, Rogers mentioned how she felt a kinship with Gabrielle over her affinity for outer space: “[The cosmos] is something that has always resonated with me and is very apparent and present in my musical work.” Gossip Girl’s Whitney Peak said the collection made her feel like a “superstar” before joking, “I feel like I shouldn’t be wearing it. I don’t know how they let me get away with this!” and then grasping the 1932 Comète Couture necklace in 18-karat gold and diamonds around her neck.

What makes it extraordinary is its ability to transform: The halos detach to become brooches, and the central row of diamonds becomes a bracelet, converting the necklace into a shorter version. Thirteen other pieces from the 1932 collection also have the ability to transform in a similar manner, allowing the wearer to make new diamond constellations around their wrists and necks.Guests dining at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinMany of the pieces were made without clasps, something Gabrielle Chanel openly disliked. “I detest clasps! I’ve done away with clasps! Yet my jewelry is transformable,” she said in an interview in 1932 after the “Bijoux de Diamants” exhibition. She strived to design pieces that offered flexibility to busy women with full lives, and that didn’t impede their freedom. And as the jewelry-spangled guests left their cares behind to dance under a canopy of baby’s breath, it was evident that the new 1932 collection stays true to her vision.Tara GonzalezTara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.

Chanel Just Unveiled Its Most Opulent Jewelry in 90 Years,"Prada has never done things by the book. The brand has been creating the world's most desirable fashion pieces since their start over one hundred years ago, going from making humble leather goods to being one of the biggest privately owned brands in the world. Now, the brand is expanding on their aesthetic universe with a daring introduction into fine jewelry. The inaugural collection, titled ETERNAL GOLD, marks both a commitment to beauty and to sustainable, circular fashion.Maya Hawke for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsAs Prada's first-ever fine jewelry offering, ETERNAL GOLD is a first in many aspects. It's also the world's first fine jewelry collection made entirely with recycled gold, collected using the industry's most rigorous standards set by the Responsible Jewelry Council. Prada is also the first company to expand on diamond traceability, making every single carat count traceable down to its origins. The complete transparency of every material used in their jewelry, from sourcing to cutting to setting, is a radical step in the direction of honest production for an otherwise murky process. Somi Jeon for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsThe jewelry is a reflection of Prada's impact on the industry and a continuation of their efforts to creating beautiful objects that stands the test of time, as all fine jewelry should. ETERNAL GOLD is rife with Pradaisms, with the instantly recognizable Prada triangle rendered as sleek earrings and pendants, but also imbued in clasp closures, and more subtly, in chain links and as the head and tail of the snake bracelet.  The snake bracelet itself may at first recall other serpent bracelets, but finds its own voice with the sneaky Prada triangle and smooth, unvarnished gold. Heart pendants take on an edgy effect with the triangle chainlink it sits on.More From Harper's BAZAARCourtesyCourtesyPrada chose three voices of our time to don this foundational collection, representing where Prada is now and where it can go.

Prada Makes Fine Jewelry History with Eternal Gold Collection,"Is any woman as synonymous with another creature as Mariah Carey is with a butterfly?This week, the singer celebrated the 30th anniversary of the release of her groundbreaking album Butterfly, and now she celebrates the arrival of her collaboration with the jeweler Chopard, which launches in stores and online today, September 16. The pieces, a mix of butterflies rendered in diamonds on rings, bracelets, earrings, and a breathtaking statement necklace, commemorate Carey’s  longtime affinity for the creature who helped her conceptualize her life as an independent artist at the top of a male-dominated music industry. She describes the process of seeing and wearing the pieces, while simultaneously celebrating “my favorite album that I’ve done,” as an emotional experience. “It’s a major moment, and it’s a full circle moment,” she says. Here she tells us about conceptualizing the collection, her daily jewelry wardrobe, and how she will wear the pieces.Harper’s Bazaar: I want to start by talking about this incredible butterfly necklace. Mariah Carey: Oh my gosh.HB: The butterfly, of course, is this incredibly significant symbol of transformation for you. But seeing the butterfly rendered in diamonds reminded me of how dazzling they are. They’re the most beautiful living creatures. And I wondered if you learned anything about the butterfly, seeing it rendered in diamonds. The enduring symbol of the butterfly—I mean, we can go on and on about different people's interpretations and feelings. My own personal feelings are so very specific to my album Butterfly and that period of my life, which we are celebrating the anniversary of this year, [coincidentally] at the same time that this is all happening, right? Because we've been working on this [with Chopard] for two years together, and it happened by accident [that] we’re re-releasing the Butterfly album, which is my favorite album that I’ve done.And yes, I have a very specific relationship with the butterfly and just the whole metamorphosis of it. The way that I had to come through a very difficult time in my life and, you know, like they say, you’ve gotta go through something to get something. I had to get to that place where I felt empowered enough to metaphorically fly and be free from that place where I was. I started out in this industry as such a young girl in a really difficult world, dominated by men. I wrote this song as I was leaving this mansion that I had paid for half of, and [where] I had sort of created my own little prison, not really deliberately, but it ended up feeling that way. And I was leaving and I wrote the lyrics and the melody to [the song “Butterfly”]: Spread your wings and prepare to fly / for you have become a butterfly. And so that’s always stuck with me. I’ve made many albums since then, but it’s just very specific to me. So to see this magnificent butterfly necklace, and the ring—I mean, it was so much to even be able to say, I collaborated on this. To be able to admire the craft—I don’t want to say “craftsmanship.” Please give me another word.HB: The creation, the artistry?The artistry! That’s what it is. Just to be able to collaborate with Chopard and doing this collection is a humongous honor. I’m just here, ready to put some diamonds on and hang out. Whatever! Courtesy of Chopard.HB: What is your daily jewelry wardrobe? Are we wearing the butterfly ring every day and the necklace for special occasions? Or is there a different routine here?I am not really one for routines of any sort. I’m not a dancer. I don’t really like to follow rules. So I would wear any piece on any occasion. But right now i’m wearing a bracelet that my daughter made for me that says “Lamily” on it, which is an homage to my fans made of little beads and elastic, with some diamond bracelets. I would wear any piece from the collection in a casual moment, or more specifically the Happy Butterfly collection, which I love so much. I think they’re gonna look gorgeous stacked with even just a T-shirt and jeans, leggings, a simple dress. There’s just really great pieces that are attainable, as well as those gorgeous—I don’t find them over the top, some might say they are; they’re major—pieces that I live for.They are really major. And they feel so you. I can see you wearing this incredible butterfly necklace with a T-shirt, or these enormous leaf earrings.I would do that! I’m so ready to wear those. When Caroline [Scheufele, the president of Chopard] was evolving and creating them, she was explaining them to me and I knew exactly what she meant, but when I saw them, I was losing it. I mean, they’re just sick. It’s beyond. They’re so good. [Laughs.]Sounds like you and Caroline had good chemistry.I feel like Caroline probably has incredible chemistry with anyone cuz she’s so fun and carefree. I love that about her. She’s also an artist and a businesswoman, and to work with her to make this collection together, [it feels] even more extra special because it was my idea and I was able to watch it happen.Courtesy of Chopard.Would you say it’s true that diamonds are a girl’s best friend?Well, considering the people I know, for sure. Maybe the exception of one or two. You know, at the end of the day, they’re not going to steer you wrong! Do you feel like jewelry plays an important part in your life spiritually? It can be armor, but it also reflects the essential feminine aspects of who you are.That’s interesting. I’ve never thought of it that way. There were little things, little pieces that I’ve had throughout my life, where they did have their own—I wouldn’t say spiritual, but they had a sort of special significance to me where I would keep them on no matter what. Swimming, whatever I was doing, I would keep them on. Because they were that special to me. And at one point I lost a piece of jewelry that I loved so much, and it wasn’t even that it was a major thing. It just meant something to me. But with this collection, everything means so much to me that I’m just excited to share it with the world.

Kaia Gerber Puts a Model-Off-Duty Spin on the Coastal Grandmother Trend,"Katie Holmes's classic street style has set its sights on the pants trend du jour: low-rise jeans. Yesterday, the Dawson's Creek alum was spotted out and about in New York City running errands while wearing an effortlessly stylish look. Her breezy, late-summer ensemble consisted of a blush pink spaghetti-strap cami tucked into a pair of baggy low-rise jeans in a light wash. She continued the minimalist approach with the rest of her outfit, wearing olive green flip-flops and carrying a maroon shoulder bag from A.P.C., eschewing jewelry entirely.BACKGRIDBaggy pants have made cameos in Holmes's street style before.Earlier this month, she made a cozy appearance in the city, accompanied by boyfriend Bobby Wooten III, while wearing an oversized slouchy pair of black trousers. She paired the statement pants with a classic light gray knit sweater with a red-and-cream pattern across the chest and shoulders, and finished the look with a brown leather cross-body bag.Back in June, the actress talked to BAZAAR.com about curating her sense of style, both on and off set.""I directed two films back-to-back this year, and I did the costumes as well, which made me appreciate my friends who are costume designers and all the costume designers I've worked with in the past,"" Holmes said of her work on Rare Objects and a still-untitled romance movie based in Connecticut. ""It made me appreciate silhouettes and cuts and color in a way I thought I had, but when you put it on camera, when you are trying to tell a story, you can see how clothing can do a lot of the work for you.""Of her personal wardrobe, she added, ""I love my T-shirts, and I love my vintage T-shirts. They're so yummy. They're a little dirty, a little stained or whatever, and that's me.""Chelsey SanchezDigital Associate EditorAs an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.

I think they’re gonna look gorgeous stacked with even just a T-shirt and jeans, leggings, a simple dress. There’s just really great pieces that are attainable, as well as those gorgeous—I don’t find them over the top, some might say they are; they’re major—pieces that I live for.They are really major. And they feel so you. I can see you wearing this incredible butterfly necklace with a T-shirt, or these enormous leaf earrings.I would do that! I’m so ready to wear those. When Caroline [Scheufele, the president of Chopard] was evolving and creating them, she was explaining them to me and I knew exactly what she meant, but when I saw them, I was losing it. I mean, they’re just sick. It’s beyond. They’re so good. [Laughs.]Sounds like you and Caroline had good chemistry.I feel like Caroline probably has incredible chemistry with anyone cuz she’s so fun and carefree. I love that about her. She’s also an artist and a businesswoman, and to work with her to make this collection together, [it feels] even more extra special because it was my idea and I was able to watch it happen.Courtesy of Chopard.Would you say it’s true that diamonds are a girl’s best friend?Well, considering the people I know, for sure. Maybe the exception of one or two. You know, at the end of the day, they’re not going to steer you wrong! Do you feel like jewelry plays an important part in your life spiritually? It can be armor, but it also reflects the essential feminine aspects of who you are.That’s interesting. I’ve never thought of it that way. There were little things, little pieces that I’ve had throughout my life, where they did have their own—I wouldn’t say spiritual, but they had a sort of special significance to me where I would keep them on no matter what. Swimming, whatever I was doing, I would keep them on. Because they were that special to me. And at one point I lost a piece of jewelry that I loved so much, and it wasn’t even that it was a major thing. It just meant something to me. But with this collection, everything means so much to me that I’m just excited to share it with the world.

15 Trends from the 1960s That Are Still Everywhere in Fashion,"Katie Holmes's classic street style has set its sights on the pants trend du jour: low-rise jeans. Yesterday, the Dawson's Creek alum was spotted out and about in New York City running errands while wearing an effortlessly stylish look. Her breezy, late-summer ensemble consisted of a blush pink spaghetti-strap cami tucked into a pair of baggy low-rise jeans in a light wash. She continued the minimalist approach with the rest of her outfit, wearing olive green flip-flops and carrying a maroon shoulder bag from A.P.C., eschewing jewelry entirely.BACKGRIDBaggy pants have made cameos in Holmes's street style before.Earlier this month, she made a cozy appearance in the city, accompanied by boyfriend Bobby Wooten III, while wearing an oversized slouchy pair of black trousers. She paired the statement pants with a classic light gray knit sweater with a red-and-cream pattern across the chest and shoulders, and finished the look with a brown leather cross-body bag.Back in June, the actress talked to BAZAAR.com about curating her sense of style, both on and off set.""I directed two films back-to-back this year, and I did the costumes as well, which made me appreciate my friends who are costume designers and all the costume designers I've worked with in the past,"" Holmes said of her work on Rare Objects and a still-untitled romance movie based in Connecticut. ""It made me appreciate silhouettes and cuts and color in a way I thought I had, but when you put it on camera, when you are trying to tell a story, you can see how clothing can do a lot of the work for you.""Of her personal wardrobe, she added, ""I love my T-shirts, and I love my vintage T-shirts.

Rihanna Looks Gorgeous in a Sheer Gown and Gold Body Jewelry,"Worn by celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, Kendall Jenner, Tracee Ellis Ross, Millie Bobby Brown, and more, the '90s- and Y2K-inspired braided tendril trend has only increased in popularity since its reemergence during the 2022 festival season. ""The tendril trend has always been an easy way to add a little 'razzle-dazzle' to any updo,"" Erinn Courtney, a natural hair expert at StyleSeat and celebrity stylist, tells BAZAAR.com. Typically crafted as a set of smaller, face-framing braids, braided tendrils are an easy way to elevate a go-to bun or ponytail. You can also quickly enhance a salon-quality blowout or beachy waves by adding a second pair of braids near the ears for a summery, carefree hair look.View full post on InstagramView full post on InstagramWhen it comes to the styling essentials needed for a braided tendril updo versus wearing your hair completely down, professionals say there isn't much difference in the products and tools to keep in your arsenal. ""Re-creating this look at home is pretty simple,"" says celebrity stylist and Mane Addicts artist Irinel de León, who counts stars like Bella Hadid, Chrissy Teigen, and Hailey Bieber as clients.

""I also recommend applying gel around the perimeter of the hair, brushing it upwards, then securing it with a hair tie.

"13 Fall 2022 Trends Worth Shopping, According to Fashion Insiders","Ahead of the premiere of her much-awaited film Blonde, in which she portrays Marilyn Monroe, Ana de Armas is diving into a world Monroe knew quite a lot about: diamonds.The film and fashion icon famously sang ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" in the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and was known for her elegant style and love of high jewelry (remember when she wore the spectacular yellow diamond necklace dubbed The Moon of Baroda?). At the time, however, the diamond industry was seen as untouchable and unreachable for both ordinary buyers and small jewelry designers, and only big names, such as De Beers and Tiffany & Co., got the business and the notoriety. At the same time, conflict diamonds and diamond smuggling became real problems.Now, the Natural Diamond Council, along with brand ambassador de Armas, is looking to change that by backing young designers from around the world and educating buyers on the current state of the industry, which is moving toward a more sustainable and inclusive future.More From Harper's BAZAAR""I started working with the NDC in 2020, and I think it was a process for me of learning,"" de Armas tells BAZAAR.com at the NDC's launch event on June 14 at the Beekman Hotel penthouse in New York City, adding that she got to see how women in Botswana ran diamond mines and handled tractors, and essentially got to know the community behind the precious stones.    Vincenzo DiminoOn Tuesday, the NDC debuted the collections of the second class of artists from its Emerging Designers Diamond Initiative, which launched in January 2021 with $1 million of diamond credit dedicated to supporting emerging BIPOC jewelry designers, in partnership with Lorraine Schwartz.Per the NDC, ""The diamond industry is historically a generational and handshake industry where emerging designers without prior connections often experience barriers to entry. The program sets to level the playing field by providing direct, career-lasting relationships with diamantaires by underwriting $1 million in diamond credit in the designers’ own names. Industry education and resources, mentor pairings, and financial support for production and CAD designs are NDC’s efforts to help create a more equitable future.""Vincenzo DiminoDe Armas, wearing a brilliant ring and necklace from Dorian Webb and a ring from Heart the Stones by Halle Millien, says it's powerful the way in which the NDC is supporting—and financially backing—artists in the community who need the space to simply do what they're good at.""As a minority myself, I remember the days when I just wanted the chance to be in the room. I wanted to just be there. Give me the opportunity and I'll show you what I can offer,"" de Armas says. ""The fact that they're mentoring and supporting and opening the doors to relationships and careers and resources for these guys and giving them the credit is incredible.""The Cuban actress is no stranger to red-carpet glamour, and she has been dripped in diamonds for roles several times over the course of her film career, but she says the passion and originality of the up-and-coming jewelry designers' diamond pieces prove there are still ways to break boundaries in the diamond world.""It's the new generations who are going to bring a new take on jewelry. We don't have to keep wearing or interpreting jewelry in the same way,"" she says.Vincenzo DiminoJewelry, and diamonds in particular, the actress agrees, can be incredibly personal. They can be much more than just beautiful, high-priced pieces we like to look at. A jewelry collection can be passed down for generations, it can carry different meanings and morph and be modernized through the years—take Duchess Kate's inherited jewelry from Princess Diana, for example.De Armas says there is one piece she bought herself that she cherishes above all others: an antique ring that reminds her of her grandmother.""I had a ring from my grandma that I'm pretty sure was not a diamond, but it was this dark red stone with little things around it, and I lost it at the airport and I was so, so, so, so sad,"" she recalls in a conversation with BAZAAR. ""And years went by, and then I was shooting a movie and we were shooting on the street and I bumped into an antique store and I found the version of that ring—same color, but this time real diamonds—and I had to get it. It wasn't my grandma's ring, but it just reminds me of her. I have it here, actually, because I always wear it."" Maybe not as meaningful but equally dazzling were the jewels de Armas got to wear while filming the 2021 James Bond film No Time to Die with Daniel Craig.""That was beautiful—such an incredible touch for the character. Everything was so simple but I just felt like the jewelry really matched her personality: so sparkly and shiny and happy,"" de Armas says.Vincenzo DiminoWalking around the NDC event, where the young designers showcased their diamond creations, the actress couldn't keep her eyes off Birthright Foundry's Heritage Diamond Ula Nifo choker, crafted from 18-karat yellow gold and natural white diamonds but inspired by whale tooth necklaces from Samoa. The Ula Nifo necklace was worn by Samoan chiefs and their children in ancient times, and signified wealth and status, designer Constance Polamalu explains.""It's just so different,"" de Armas says.Grant Mobley, a diamond and fine jewelry expert at the NDC, tells BAZAAR how rare and exciting it is to see a high-jewelry piece so influenced by a designer's underrepresented culture, and yet so wearable today.""If you think back to these incredible Samoan jewelry designs with the amazing necklace collars from well over 100 years ago, she's turning that into something that makes sense for the modern day, and she's also doing that with fine jewelry materials: gold, diamonds,"" he says. ""It's something that might've been worn hundreds of years ago by her ancestors, but she's making it something that she would wear and that you would see on the red carpet.""The collections of the latest EDDI class of designers—Casey Perez, Corey Anthony Jones, Lana Ogilvie (Sabre Jewelry), Mckenzie Liautaud, Halle Millien (Heart the Stones), and Ruben Manuel—will launch this Friday, June 17, on 1stDibs.

Prada Makes Fine Jewelry History with Eternal Gold Collection,"Storing your jewelry can be an afterthought to wearing your jewelry.

Kaia Gerber Puts a Model-Off-Duty Spin on the Coastal Grandmother Trend,"Lately I wonder if we’re living through a mass psychosis expressing itself through trend reporting. If it felt a year ago like anything goes—that the restrictions and trauma of the pandemic highlighted fashion and self-expression as a new outlet for freedom—increasingly it seems that there are a thousand trends happening at once. In just the past month, I have read stories about a new twist on the girlboss trend called “that girl,” a trend in which women really enjoy themselves, and a trend in which women enjoy themselves a little, plus “dinocore,” “clowncore,” and “twee.” On TikTok, trend forecasting has become the new influencer hustle, almost a trend itself; creators who can string together photographic evidence with a pithy and compelling monologue are performing a kind of competitive prophecy. And the platform’s algorithm seems to favor this sort of information sharing: the more ridiculous the prediction, the more traction it gains, and the more predictions we are fed. In the meantime, fast fashion brands like Shein have sped production to such a pace that they can both predict and reflect these trends, making them feel all the more real while we ping pong through “feels” and “vibes” with no aesthetic compass. Even runway fashion, which is supposed to move at a slower, biannual speed, has joined this rat race, as designers pack their shows with potential viral moments and styles that are replicable by anyone with a little ingenuity and a pair of scissors. The tempo of fashion makes everything feel quick, carefree, and, sometimes, unfortunately, even careless. Mostly it seems that people are doing things humans have done for most of the past century—relaxing, working hard, having martinis, not having martinis—but now we cannot resist the urge to package them into something that feels more meaningful than mere consumer choices.Jerry Lorenzo, the 44-year-old designer behind the brand Fear of God, is a man who has started many trends himself (real trends, that is). When he began his brand almost a decade ago, it was a luxury cornerstone of the hypebeast movement, which often encourages a cut-throat, product-driven style of consumerism. Lorenzo worked on an early season of Yeezy alongside then-Vetements designer Demna, and, after making T-shirts for Justin Bieber’s “Purpose” tour, helped turn merch into meaningful clothes. He was a close friend of and collaborator with the late Virgil Abloh, whose brand Off-White propelled streetwear to the forefront of fashion, and his sneakers and sweatpants remain staples in hip corridors of Los Angeles and New York. But lately, Lorenzo has been on a different kind of fashion journey. In early 2020 he collaborated with Ermenegildo Zegna’s Alessandro Sartori for a collection that shifted menswear’s inner circle’s attitude around suiting, making it feel less performative and more like a staple. And now his collections, which arrive on his own time rather than seasonally, serve a slower, even higher purpose. Today, he is releasing a new collection, his first in nearly two years. As he worked on it, he said in a video interview late last week, he asked himself of every garment, “Is this timeless?”“I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now,” he said. “And I want to provide a safe space for someone that wants to step outside of that, but can still step into that conversation with everyone else that’s of ‘the now’ and feel of ‘the now,’ but not have to be so on trend.” Instead, what he wants his clothing to do is help his customers “feel the confidence. I want them to feel sophisticated, but I want them to feel the freedom to be themselves and know that it’s not the trend that validates you. It’s the individual that you are.” Lorenzo calls this collection Eternal. And while the clothing is a natural progression of the easy elegance of the collections he dropped in late summer and fall of 2020, it seems quite radical, to me, to proclaim you want to defy the trend cycle and try to make something that has lasting value. It seems so obvious, to try to float above it all, and yet the intoxicating quest for relevance has made it a rare impulse. Lorenzo is almost dipping into the realm of slow fashion—of designers with far less recognizable names who rarely stage fashion shows, like the 19th-century inspired work of Paul Harnden, the simple French cottons of Casey Casey, or the heady beauty of Elena Dawson. They make clothing that is intentionally hard to find and difficult to make. Lorenzo hasn’t gone that far, of course, and he has in his corner the fact that his clothing is meant to make you feel as comfortable in a suit as you are in your favorite sweatshirt. That means it has the potential to transcend the cognoscenti customer of slow fashion brands, or perhaps convert recovering hypebeasts into cognoscenti. He is designing with incredible thoughtfulness, even integrity–almost like a novel. “I approach it like a book or a music album,” said Lorenzo of putting together collections. “I don't really approach it in terms of seasons and seasonality. I approach it like, Hey, do I have something to say? Do I have the resources to say what I wanna say in the best way?” He remains independently owned–he also has a partnership with Adidas, where he serves as the head of strategy for their basketball category—and his resources are just catching up to his point of view, as he put it. He’s been able to move 80% of his production to Italy, for example. “And so hopefully each time we have something to say, it’s better than the last thing we said.” Lorenzo, of course, isn’t the only designer to prize continual improvement over novelty. The Row’s Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen come to mind, and Lorenzo, like The Row and other influential American aesthetes, is particularly drawn, lately, to the 1980s and ’90s designs of Giorgio Armani. His cascades of beige in flowing, almost spiritually understated cuts wrote a new script for minimalism. If Prada was cerebral, edgy, and obscure, and Calvin Klein was sexy, Armani was, just as Lorenzo said, a man of confidence, whose clothing blessed its wearers with a feeling of monastic chic weightlessness. “I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now.”In Eternal, the cuts are generous without swamping their wearer in fabric; the tones are bones, milky beiges, and greyish whites; and nearly all the pants blur the line between a structured trouser and a cozy sweatpant. You can see how a person dressed in these clothes might calm a room of investors or subtly change the energy in a coffee shop line. “I am in fashion, and I do love to present myself a certain way,” Lorenzo mused. “But that’s always been something that is understated. It’s always been something that isn’t loud and doesn’t call for attention. As quiet as I want to be in a room, I also want to be competent, you know?” Like Armani—and again, like The Row—Lorenzo is thinking about how his clothing might provide solutions, not only to the holes in your wardrobe but to your own questions about your sense of self. How do you wear a suit, which has different proportions and fabrics than a hoodie or track pants, and still feel like yourself? “That’s what I’m always chasing, you know? How can I be always sophisticated in the way that I present myself, but honest, and relaxed and comfortable?” Lorenzo’s evolution as a designer over the past decade, from a Los Angeles DJ to a new hero in intentional clothing creation, has been one of fashion’s most interesting. By staying independent, he’s allowed himself the time to grow and explore that investors or big luxury house appointments rarely afford. Too often, a designer’s references are too readily apparent, too surface—Ralph Lauren’s Polo line, or Annie Leibowitz’s images for The Gap, or the wackadoo spirit of 1980s couture that seems to have captured the imagination of many young womenswear designers in New York. In fact, prior to his dalliance with Zegna, Lorenzo spoke about wanting to build a brand like Lauren’s. But Lorenzo has a new modesty about him, and his clothing feels intimate in a way that Lauren’s, which is much more like a worshipful encyclopedia of American style, simply cannot. We talked about how opting out of trendiness can be quite boring—depending on how many viscose trouser-wearing influencers you follow on Instagram, you might say it’s even something of a trend itself—and how he’s tweaked his pieces, and played with fabrics, to give his pieces some heart and some personality. Changing the shoulder on a jacket from a past collection to make it feel less 1980s, for example. The result is that these are real clothes, for someone who is not trying to create a look for a moment in time, but who believes fashion can improve your life in small but significant ways.Open GalleryRachel TashjianRachel Tashjian is the Fashion News Director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.

The 10 Winter Nail Trends We Can't Wait to Wear,"Usually, when Phoebe Bridgers talks about the moon, she's singing to a group of crying fans (I am, admittedly, one of them) who are mouthing the words to her ""Moon Song."" But last week, she could be found talking about astronomy in a not-heart-wrenching context—while wearing Chanel jewelry inspired by the stars. Standing underneath a crescent moon on a stage in Los Angeles, she introduced the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who were performing for Chanel’s guests at a dinner celebrating the launch of the 1932 jewelry collection, which is the second one ever released by the brand. The crowd cheered, but the 18-karat Coco Crush earrings and bracelet adorning Bridgers’s earlobes and wrist were beautiful enough that they could have elicited tears (of jealousy). Phoebe Bridgers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinIt has been 90 years since Gabrielle Chanel designed Bijoux de Diamants, the first high jewelry collection in history. It was created three years after Black Thursday pushed the world into the Great Depression, and Chanel was determined to create something that could shine through the turmoil. The 50-piece collection was made of white and yellow diamonds set in platinum and yellow gold, with 22 pieces inspired by specific constellations. “Nothing could be better for forgetting the crisis than feasting one’s eyes on beautiful new things,” she said of the collection. And so it feels fitting that in 2022, nearly three years after the entire world stood still for the pandemic, the fashion house she built would respond to our somber times with something just as sumptuous.More From Harper's BAZAARThe Yeah Yeah Yeahs performing at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinLike the original Bijoux de Diamants collection, the design of 1932 is harmonized around three symbols: the comet, the moon, and the sun. Chanel muses like Marion Cotillard, Lori Harvey, Greta Lee, and Whitney Peak were in attendance at the West Hollywood celebration, and, like Bridgers, were also layered in pieces from the 1932 collection named after the cosmos. Maggie Rogers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection. Pat MartinSinger Maggie Rogers, who also recently graduated from Harvard’s Divinity School, wore five rings from the collection but said the shooting star Comète ear cuff in 18-karat gold was her favorite. On the Chanel black carpet, Rogers mentioned how she felt a kinship with Gabrielle over her affinity for outer space: “[The cosmos] is something that has always resonated with me and is very apparent and present in my musical work.” Gossip Girl’s Whitney Peak said the collection made her feel like a “superstar” before joking, “I feel like I shouldn’t be wearing it. I don’t know how they let me get away with this!” and then grasping the 1932 Comète Couture necklace in 18-karat gold and diamonds around her neck. Whitney Peak at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinWhile there are 77 pieces in the collection, its signature piece is the Allure Céleste necklace, with round-cut diamonds, an oval sapphire of deep blue, and a weight of 55.5 carats. What makes it extraordinary is its ability to transform: The halos detach to become brooches, and the central row of diamonds becomes a bracelet, converting the necklace into a shorter version. Thirteen other pieces from the 1932 collection also have the ability to transform in a similar manner, allowing the wearer to make new diamond constellations around their wrists and necks.Guests dining at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinMany of the pieces were made without clasps, something Gabrielle Chanel openly disliked. “I detest clasps! I’ve done away with clasps! Yet my jewelry is transformable,” she said in an interview in 1932 after the “Bijoux de Diamants” exhibition. She strived to design pieces that offered flexibility to busy women with full lives, and that didn’t impede their freedom. And as the jewelry-spangled guests left their cares behind to dance under a canopy of baby’s breath, it was evident that the new 1932 collection stays true to her vision.Tara GonzalezTara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.

Mariah Carey’s Butterfly Jewelry “Is a Major Moment”,"Prada has never done things by the book. The brand has been creating the world's most desirable fashion pieces since their start over one hundred years ago, going from making humble leather goods to being one of the biggest privately owned brands in the world. Now, the brand is expanding on their aesthetic universe with a daring introduction into fine jewelry. The inaugural collection, titled ETERNAL GOLD, marks both a commitment to beauty and to sustainable, circular fashion.Maya Hawke for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsAs Prada's first-ever fine jewelry offering, ETERNAL GOLD is a first in many aspects. It's also the world's first fine jewelry collection made entirely with recycled gold, collected using the industry's most rigorous standards set by the Responsible Jewelry Council. Prada is also the first company to expand on diamond traceability, making every single carat count traceable down to its origins. The complete transparency of every material used in their jewelry, from sourcing to cutting to setting, is a radical step in the direction of honest production for an otherwise murky process. Somi Jeon for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsThe jewelry is a reflection of Prada's impact on the industry and a continuation of their efforts to creating beautiful objects that stands the test of time, as all fine jewelry should. ETERNAL GOLD is rife with Pradaisms, with the instantly recognizable Prada triangle rendered as sleek earrings and pendants, but also imbued in clasp closures, and more subtly, in chain links and as the head and tail of the snake bracelet.  The snake bracelet itself may at first recall other serpent bracelets, but finds its own voice with the sneaky Prada triangle and smooth, unvarnished gold. Heart pendants take on an edgy effect with the triangle chainlink it sits on.More From Harper's BAZAARCourtesyCourtesyPrada chose three voices of our time to don this foundational collection, representing where Prada is now and where it can go. Amanda Gorman, award-winning poet and activist, Maya Hawke, singer/songwriter, actress, and model, and Somi Jeon, musician, become one with the gold, immortalized in gold negative renderings by David Sims. The jewelry and its campaign represent the future of a wholly responsible planet that isn't sacrificing purity and beauty at its demise. The act of both looking good and doing good is something all brands should aim toward.From: ELLE USKevin LeBlancKevin LeBlanc is the Fashion Associate at ELLE Magazine.

The 19 Best Ballet Flats That Transcend Shoe Trends,"If looking stylish in sneakers and your boyfriend's button-down is a skill set, Kaia Gerber is the master.Yesterday, the model was seen walking around Los Angeles looking comfortable in an effortlessly cool ensemble that brought to mind the now-viral coastal grandmother trend.

Katie Holmes Is Fully Embracing Fall's Latest Pants Trend,"Is any woman as synonymous with another creature as Mariah Carey is with a butterfly?This week, the singer celebrated the 30th anniversary of the release of her groundbreaking album Butterfly, and now she celebrates the arrival of her collaboration with the jeweler Chopard, which launches in stores and online today, September 16. The pieces, a mix of butterflies rendered in diamonds on rings, bracelets, earrings, and a breathtaking statement necklace, commemorate Carey’s  longtime affinity for the creature who helped her conceptualize her life as an independent artist at the top of a male-dominated music industry. She describes the process of seeing and wearing the pieces, while simultaneously celebrating “my favorite album that I’ve done,” as an emotional experience. “It’s a major moment, and it’s a full circle moment,” she says. Here she tells us about conceptualizing the collection, her daily jewelry wardrobe, and how she will wear the pieces.Harper’s Bazaar: I want to start by talking about this incredible butterfly necklace. Mariah Carey: Oh my gosh.HB: The butterfly, of course, is this incredibly significant symbol of transformation for you. But seeing the butterfly rendered in diamonds reminded me of how dazzling they are. They’re the most beautiful living creatures. And I wondered if you learned anything about the butterfly, seeing it rendered in diamonds. The enduring symbol of the butterfly—I mean, we can go on and on about different people's interpretations and feelings. My own personal feelings are so very specific to my album Butterfly and that period of my life, which we are celebrating the anniversary of this year, [coincidentally] at the same time that this is all happening, right? Because we've been working on this [with Chopard] for two years together, and it happened by accident [that] we’re re-releasing the Butterfly album, which is my favorite album that I’ve done.And yes, I have a very specific relationship with the butterfly and just the whole metamorphosis of it. The way that I had to come through a very difficult time in my life and, you know, like they say, you’ve gotta go through something to get something. I had to get to that place where I felt empowered enough to metaphorically fly and be free from that place where I was. I started out in this industry as such a young girl in a really difficult world, dominated by men. I wrote this song as I was leaving this mansion that I had paid for half of, and [where] I had sort of created my own little prison, not really deliberately, but it ended up feeling that way. And I was leaving and I wrote the lyrics and the melody to [the song “Butterfly”]: Spread your wings and prepare to fly / for you have become a butterfly. And so that’s always stuck with me. I’ve made many albums since then, but it’s just very specific to me. So to see this magnificent butterfly necklace, and the ring—I mean, it was so much to even be able to say, I collaborated on this. To be able to admire the craft—I don’t want to say “craftsmanship.” Please give me another word.HB: The creation, the artistry?The artistry! That’s what it is. Just to be able to collaborate with Chopard and doing this collection is a humongous honor. I’m just here, ready to put some diamonds on and hang out. Whatever! Courtesy of Chopard.HB: What is your daily jewelry wardrobe? Are we wearing the butterfly ring every day and the necklace for special occasions? Or is there a different routine here?I am not really one for routines of any sort. I’m not a dancer. I don’t really like to follow rules. So I would wear any piece on any occasion. But right now i’m wearing a bracelet that my daughter made for me that says “Lamily” on it, which is an homage to my fans made of little beads and elastic, with some diamond bracelets. I would wear any piece from the collection in a casual moment, or more specifically the Happy Butterfly collection, which I love so much. I think they’re gonna look gorgeous stacked with even just a T-shirt and jeans, leggings, a simple dress. There’s just really great pieces that are attainable, as well as those gorgeous—I don’t find them over the top, some might say they are; they’re major—pieces that I live for.They are really major. And they feel so you. I can see you wearing this incredible butterfly necklace with a T-shirt, or these enormous leaf earrings.I would do that! I’m so ready to wear those. When Caroline [Scheufele, the president of Chopard] was evolving and creating them, she was explaining them to me and I knew exactly what she meant, but when I saw them, I was losing it. I mean, they’re just sick. It’s beyond. They’re so good. [Laughs.]Sounds like you and Caroline had good chemistry.I feel like Caroline probably has incredible chemistry with anyone cuz she’s so fun and carefree. I love that about her. She’s also an artist and a businesswoman, and to work with her to make this collection together, [it feels] even more extra special because it was my idea and I was able to watch it happen.Courtesy of Chopard.Would you say it’s true that diamonds are a girl’s best friend?Well, considering the people I know, for sure. Maybe the exception of one or two. You know, at the end of the day, they’re not going to steer you wrong! Do you feel like jewelry plays an important part in your life spiritually? It can be armor, but it also reflects the essential feminine aspects of who you are.That’s interesting. I’ve never thought of it that way. There were little things, little pieces that I’ve had throughout my life, where they did have their own—I wouldn’t say spiritual, but they had a sort of special significance to me where I would keep them on no matter what. Swimming, whatever I was doing, I would keep them on. Because they were that special to me. And at one point I lost a piece of jewelry that I loved so much, and it wasn’t even that it was a major thing. It just meant something to me. But with this collection, everything means so much to me that I’m just excited to share it with the world.

Carly Cushnie Collaborates on a Sweet Aquamarine Jewelry Collection,"Katie Holmes's classic street style has set its sights on the pants trend du jour: low-rise jeans. Yesterday, the Dawson's Creek alum was spotted out and about in New York City running errands while wearing an effortlessly stylish look. Her breezy, late-summer ensemble consisted of a blush pink spaghetti-strap cami tucked into a pair of baggy low-rise jeans in a light wash. She continued the minimalist approach with the rest of her outfit, wearing olive green flip-flops and carrying a maroon shoulder bag from A.P.C., eschewing jewelry entirely.BACKGRIDBaggy pants have made cameos in Holmes's street style before.Earlier this month, she made a cozy appearance in the city, accompanied by boyfriend Bobby Wooten III, while wearing an oversized slouchy pair of black trousers. She paired the statement pants with a classic light gray knit sweater with a red-and-cream pattern across the chest and shoulders, and finished the look with a brown leather cross-body bag.Back in June, the actress talked to BAZAAR.com about curating her sense of style, both on and off set.""I directed two films back-to-back this year, and I did the costumes as well, which made me appreciate my friends who are costume designers and all the costume designers I've worked with in the past,"" Holmes said of her work on Rare Objects and a still-untitled romance movie based in Connecticut. ""It made me appreciate silhouettes and cuts and color in a way I thought I had, but when you put it on camera, when you are trying to tell a story, you can see how clothing can do a lot of the work for you.""Of her personal wardrobe, she added, ""I love my T-shirts, and I love my vintage T-shirts.

Fall 2022's 5 Best Jewelry Trends Are Unexpected and Bold,"Worn by celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, Kendall Jenner, Tracee Ellis Ross, Millie Bobby Brown, and more, the '90s- and Y2K-inspired braided tendril trend has only increased in popularity since its reemergence during the 2022 festival season. ""The tendril trend has always been an easy way to add a little 'razzle-dazzle' to any updo,"" Erinn Courtney, a natural hair expert at StyleSeat and celebrity stylist, tells BAZAAR.com. Typically crafted as a set of smaller, face-framing braids, braided tendrils are an easy way to elevate a go-to bun or ponytail. You can also quickly enhance a salon-quality blowout or beachy waves by adding a second pair of braids near the ears for a summery, carefree hair look.View full post on InstagramView full post on InstagramWhen it comes to the styling essentials needed for a braided tendril updo versus wearing your hair completely down, professionals say there isn't much difference in the products and tools to keep in your arsenal. ""Re-creating this look at home is pretty simple,"" says celebrity stylist and Mane Addicts artist Irinel de León, who counts stars like Bella Hadid, Chrissy Teigen, and Hailey Bieber as clients. ""You'll need a little gel, a tail comb, and two small rubber bands—more if you're looking to add braids throughout the hair as well.""Shop the Braided Tendril Hair TrendGoody Ouchless Women's Clear Elastic Hair Tie (250 Count)Now 33% Off$5 at AmazonCredit: AmazonOribe  Gel Serum Radiance$63 at oribe.comCredit: Oribeghd Tail Comb$22 at GHD HairCredit: ghdTancho High Grade Tique Vegetable Pomade in Lavender$20 at AmazonCredit: AmazonCreme of Nature Argan Oil Perfect Edges$5 at Sally BeautyCredit: Sally BeautyEvolve Perfect Edge BrushNow 50% Off$5 at AmazonCredit: Amazonslip  Pure Silk 6-Pack Skinny Scrunchies $39 at NordstromCredit: NordstromDe Leon recommends starting off the look by centering your hair down the middle and creating two triangular parts on the left- and right-hand sides.

""For updos in particular, I love using a little barber's brush to smooth hair into a cute bun or pony,"" she adds. ""I also recommend applying gel around the perimeter of the hair, brushing it upwards, then securing it with a hair tie.

12 Trends that Define 2022 So Far,"Ahead of the premiere of her much-awaited film Blonde, in which she portrays Marilyn Monroe, Ana de Armas is diving into a world Monroe knew quite a lot about: diamonds.The film and fashion icon famously sang ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" in the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and was known for her elegant style and love of high jewelry (remember when she wore the spectacular yellow diamond necklace dubbed The Moon of Baroda?). At the time, however, the diamond industry was seen as untouchable and unreachable for both ordinary buyers and small jewelry designers, and only big names, such as De Beers and Tiffany & Co., got the business and the notoriety. At the same time, conflict diamonds and diamond smuggling became real problems.Now, the Natural Diamond Council, along with brand ambassador de Armas, is looking to change that by backing young designers from around the world and educating buyers on the current state of the industry, which is moving toward a more sustainable and inclusive future.More From Harper's BAZAAR""I started working with the NDC in 2020, and I think it was a process for me of learning,"" de Armas tells BAZAAR.com at the NDC's launch event on June 14 at the Beekman Hotel penthouse in New York City, adding that she got to see how women in Botswana ran diamond mines and handled tractors, and essentially got to know the community behind the precious stones.    Vincenzo DiminoOn Tuesday, the NDC debuted the collections of the second class of artists from its Emerging Designers Diamond Initiative, which launched in January 2021 with $1 million of diamond credit dedicated to supporting emerging BIPOC jewelry designers, in partnership with Lorraine Schwartz.Per the NDC, ""The diamond industry is historically a generational and handshake industry where emerging designers without prior connections often experience barriers to entry. The program sets to level the playing field by providing direct, career-lasting relationships with diamantaires by underwriting $1 million in diamond credit in the designers’ own names. Industry education and resources, mentor pairings, and financial support for production and CAD designs are NDC’s efforts to help create a more equitable future.""Vincenzo DiminoDe Armas, wearing a brilliant ring and necklace from Dorian Webb and a ring from Heart the Stones by Halle Millien, says it's powerful the way in which the NDC is supporting—and financially backing—artists in the community who need the space to simply do what they're good at.""As a minority myself, I remember the days when I just wanted the chance to be in the room. I wanted to just be there. Give me the opportunity and I'll show you what I can offer,"" de Armas says. ""The fact that they're mentoring and supporting and opening the doors to relationships and careers and resources for these guys and giving them the credit is incredible.""The Cuban actress is no stranger to red-carpet glamour, and she has been dripped in diamonds for roles several times over the course of her film career, but she says the passion and originality of the up-and-coming jewelry designers' diamond pieces prove there are still ways to break boundaries in the diamond world.""It's the new generations who are going to bring a new take on jewelry. We don't have to keep wearing or interpreting jewelry in the same way,"" she says.Vincenzo DiminoJewelry, and diamonds in particular, the actress agrees, can be incredibly personal. They can be much more than just beautiful, high-priced pieces we like to look at. A jewelry collection can be passed down for generations, it can carry different meanings and morph and be modernized through the years—take Duchess Kate's inherited jewelry from Princess Diana, for example.De Armas says there is one piece she bought herself that she cherishes above all others: an antique ring that reminds her of her grandmother.""I had a ring from my grandma that I'm pretty sure was not a diamond, but it was this dark red stone with little things around it, and I lost it at the airport and I was so, so, so, so sad,"" she recalls in a conversation with BAZAAR. ""And years went by, and then I was shooting a movie and we were shooting on the street and I bumped into an antique store and I found the version of that ring—same color, but this time real diamonds—and I had to get it.

Kendall Jenner Put a Sexy Spin on the Coastal Grandmother Trend,"Storing your jewelry can be an afterthought to wearing your jewelry. But your pendants and cocktail rings are still on display to you, in your home, when you're not wearing them.

Nested together or placed separately, the two asymmetric marble containers are as much miniature sculptures as they are dishes for your everyday stack. They also have shades of the function-meets-art-forms seen in Claude Home's signature vases and vessels. MejuriThe collaboration is technically Mejuri's first foray into home goods.

Ana de Armas Supports BIPOC Jewelry Designers Through Natural Diamond Council Partnership,"Lately I wonder if we’re living through a mass psychosis expressing itself through trend reporting. If it felt a year ago like anything goes—that the restrictions and trauma of the pandemic highlighted fashion and self-expression as a new outlet for freedom—increasingly it seems that there are a thousand trends happening at once. In just the past month, I have read stories about a new twist on the girlboss trend called “that girl,” a trend in which women really enjoy themselves, and a trend in which women enjoy themselves a little, plus “dinocore,” “clowncore,” and “twee.” On TikTok, trend forecasting has become the new influencer hustle, almost a trend itself; creators who can string together photographic evidence with a pithy and compelling monologue are performing a kind of competitive prophecy. And the platform’s algorithm seems to favor this sort of information sharing: the more ridiculous the prediction, the more traction it gains, and the more predictions we are fed. In the meantime, fast fashion brands like Shein have sped production to such a pace that they can both predict and reflect these trends, making them feel all the more real while we ping pong through “feels” and “vibes” with no aesthetic compass. Even runway fashion, which is supposed to move at a slower, biannual speed, has joined this rat race, as designers pack their shows with potential viral moments and styles that are replicable by anyone with a little ingenuity and a pair of scissors. The tempo of fashion makes everything feel quick, carefree, and, sometimes, unfortunately, even careless. Mostly it seems that people are doing things humans have done for most of the past century—relaxing, working hard, having martinis, not having martinis—but now we cannot resist the urge to package them into something that feels more meaningful than mere consumer choices.Jerry Lorenzo, the 44-year-old designer behind the brand Fear of God, is a man who has started many trends himself (real trends, that is). When he began his brand almost a decade ago, it was a luxury cornerstone of the hypebeast movement, which often encourages a cut-throat, product-driven style of consumerism. Lorenzo worked on an early season of Yeezy alongside then-Vetements designer Demna, and, after making T-shirts for Justin Bieber’s “Purpose” tour, helped turn merch into meaningful clothes. He was a close friend of and collaborator with the late Virgil Abloh, whose brand Off-White propelled streetwear to the forefront of fashion, and his sneakers and sweatpants remain staples in hip corridors of Los Angeles and New York. But lately, Lorenzo has been on a different kind of fashion journey. In early 2020 he collaborated with Ermenegildo Zegna’s Alessandro Sartori for a collection that shifted menswear’s inner circle’s attitude around suiting, making it feel less performative and more like a staple. And now his collections, which arrive on his own time rather than seasonally, serve a slower, even higher purpose. Today, he is releasing a new collection, his first in nearly two years. As he worked on it, he said in a video interview late last week, he asked himself of every garment, “Is this timeless?”“I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now,” he said. “And I want to provide a safe space for someone that wants to step outside of that, but can still step into that conversation with everyone else that’s of ‘the now’ and feel of ‘the now,’ but not have to be so on trend.” Instead, what he wants his clothing to do is help his customers “feel the confidence. I want them to feel sophisticated, but I want them to feel the freedom to be themselves and know that it’s not the trend that validates you. It’s the individual that you are.” Lorenzo calls this collection Eternal. And while the clothing is a natural progression of the easy elegance of the collections he dropped in late summer and fall of 2020, it seems quite radical, to me, to proclaim you want to defy the trend cycle and try to make something that has lasting value. It seems so obvious, to try to float above it all, and yet the intoxicating quest for relevance has made it a rare impulse. Lorenzo is almost dipping into the realm of slow fashion—of designers with far less recognizable names who rarely stage fashion shows, like the 19th-century inspired work of Paul Harnden, the simple French cottons of Casey Casey, or the heady beauty of Elena Dawson. They make clothing that is intentionally hard to find and difficult to make. Lorenzo hasn’t gone that far, of course, and he has in his corner the fact that his clothing is meant to make you feel as comfortable in a suit as you are in your favorite sweatshirt. That means it has the potential to transcend the cognoscenti customer of slow fashion brands, or perhaps convert recovering hypebeasts into cognoscenti. He is designing with incredible thoughtfulness, even integrity–almost like a novel. “I approach it like a book or a music album,” said Lorenzo of putting together collections. “I don't really approach it in terms of seasons and seasonality. I approach it like, Hey, do I have something to say? Do I have the resources to say what I wanna say in the best way?” He remains independently owned–he also has a partnership with Adidas, where he serves as the head of strategy for their basketball category—and his resources are just catching up to his point of view, as he put it. He’s been able to move 80% of his production to Italy, for example. “And so hopefully each time we have something to say, it’s better than the last thing we said.” Lorenzo, of course, isn’t the only designer to prize continual improvement over novelty. The Row’s Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen come to mind, and Lorenzo, like The Row and other influential American aesthetes, is particularly drawn, lately, to the 1980s and ’90s designs of Giorgio Armani. His cascades of beige in flowing, almost spiritually understated cuts wrote a new script for minimalism. If Prada was cerebral, edgy, and obscure, and Calvin Klein was sexy, Armani was, just as Lorenzo said, a man of confidence, whose clothing blessed its wearers with a feeling of monastic chic weightlessness. “I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now.”In Eternal, the cuts are generous without swamping their wearer in fabric; the tones are bones, milky beiges, and greyish whites; and nearly all the pants blur the line between a structured trouser and a cozy sweatpant. You can see how a person dressed in these clothes might calm a room of investors or subtly change the energy in a coffee shop line. “I am in fashion, and I do love to present myself a certain way,” Lorenzo mused. “But that’s always been something that is understated. It’s always been something that isn’t loud and doesn’t call for attention. As quiet as I want to be in a room, I also want to be competent, you know?” Like Armani—and again, like The Row—Lorenzo is thinking about how his clothing might provide solutions, not only to the holes in your wardrobe but to your own questions about your sense of self. How do you wear a suit, which has different proportions and fabrics than a hoodie or track pants, and still feel like yourself? “That’s what I’m always chasing, you know? How can I be always sophisticated in the way that I present myself, but honest, and relaxed and comfortable?” Lorenzo’s evolution as a designer over the past decade, from a Los Angeles DJ to a new hero in intentional clothing creation, has been one of fashion’s most interesting. By staying independent, he’s allowed himself the time to grow and explore that investors or big luxury house appointments rarely afford. Too often, a designer’s references are too readily apparent, too surface—Ralph Lauren’s Polo line, or Annie Leibowitz’s images for The Gap, or the wackadoo spirit of 1980s couture that seems to have captured the imagination of many young womenswear designers in New York. In fact, prior to his dalliance with Zegna, Lorenzo spoke about wanting to build a brand like Lauren’s. But Lorenzo has a new modesty about him, and his clothing feels intimate in a way that Lauren’s, which is much more like a worshipful encyclopedia of American style, simply cannot. We talked about how opting out of trendiness can be quite boring—depending on how many viscose trouser-wearing influencers you follow on Instagram, you might say it’s even something of a trend itself—and how he’s tweaked his pieces, and played with fabrics, to give his pieces some heart and some personality. Changing the shoulder on a jacket from a past collection to make it feel less 1980s, for example. The result is that these are real clothes, for someone who is not trying to create a look for a moment in time, but who believes fashion can improve your life in small but significant ways.Open GalleryRachel TashjianRachel Tashjian is the Fashion News Director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.

Real Fashion For the Era of Fake Trends,"MoAna Luu has spent her professional life building brands, from designing boutique hotels to serving as chief content and creative officer at Essence. But after contracting Covid-19 in March 2020, Luu decided to refocus on a new brand-building effort—one that’s entirely her own. That project is ManLuu, a line of luxury jewelry paying homage to Luu’s Creole heritage—a blend of African, Indian, French, and Caribbean traditions—and Martinique’s long tradition of jewelry-making. ManLuu arrives today at Nordstrom for its official, 21-item debut following a soft online launch this summer. ManLuu is composed of gender neutral earrings, bracelets, and rings in 18k gold vermeil and sterling silver. Nods to Creole jewelry tradition emerge through ManLuu’s use of exaggerated geometric shapes and signature woven patterns (an octagonal hoop with webbed inlays here, a chunky beaded bracelet there). ""The craftsmanship is something that is so delicate, when you see it you know you have a precious piece already,"" Luu says.More From Harper's BAZAARSome of the designer's earliest introductions to Creole craftsmanship came from her grandparents’ jewelry store in Fort-de-France, Martinique, Luu tells BAZAAR.com. But ManLuu’s devotion to quality is inspired by even earlier references, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. At that time, Black people could not become property owners, so they invested in gold jewelry heirlooms to pass down among generations. Luu says that ManLuu shares the power of this story, one that many people may not know, through each piece.MoAna Luu at the ManLuu atelier in New York City.ManLuuManLuu’s interpretation of heirloom jewelry had resonated long before this week’s Nordstrom launch. Gwyneth Paltrow, Mary J. Blige, and Maye Musk are a few of its early fans. Cardi B. even wore ManLuu bangles to announce her second pregnancy earlier this year—a special stamp of approval for the brand, Luu tells us. Joining forces with a large retailer like Nordstrom is, in some ways, even more significant than those celebrity endorsements. ""As a Black female designer and founder, I believe it's important that heritage brands welcome new creators and support them taking their place in the luxury market,"" Luu explains. ""This is a big step, not just for me, but for all of us.""While ManLuu's approach to luxury references centuries-old jewelry traditions, its use of eco-friendly materials is thoroughly 2021. Many pieces are crafted with recycled metals; later on, ManLuu will also incorporate lab-grown diamonds. Luu couldn't imagine starting a new label without incorporating conscious design techniques: “Sustainability is something that, today, is mandatory in any business."" By balancing meaningful history with modern design, ManLuu is an alternative to the throwaway jewelry sold, well, nearly everywhere. “Fast fashion was nice,” Luu says, “but now it’s time for pieces you want to keep.” And one day, pass down.Shop Manluu at NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$770 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Classic Beaded Necklace$2,650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Open Ring$600 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Cuff Bracelet$2,800 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$370 at NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$900 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Ear Jackets$1,000 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$570 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Embossed Ring$650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Long Beaded Necklace$4,200 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$470 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$1,100 at NordstromCredit: NordstromHalie LeSavageHalie LeSavage is the fashion commerce editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, where she covers everything from emerging designers to viral products to must-shop sales events.

5 Jewelry Trends Worth Adding to Your Collection This Summer,"No one can take a time-out from the Y2K fashion revival. Not even our iPhones. Like bucket hats and platform flip flops before them, phone straps of the early aughts variety are having a renaissance. Think of these attachable lanyards like the camp jewelry trend, but for your phone. The plainest phone straps start with rainbow-colored resin beads and get kitschier from there. Entire indie brands are dedicated to beaded phone straps, with String Ting, GriGri, and Hang On credited in mirror selfies across Instagram. Established accessories players are catching on, with versions appearing at Roxanne Assoulin and Lele Sadoughi. View full post on InstagramAlex Bass, founder at phone strap seller Hang On, says Y2K nostalgia is a big part of her brand. Hang On’s aesthetic harkens back to the days when cell phones were a novelty and personalizing them was a compulsion—the more glitter, the better. In Bass’s case, she stuck “stickers and rhinestones on every square centimeter of the phone, à la Carrie Bradshaw.”More From Harper's BAZAARBut there’s more to the phone strap trend than 2000 calling to give our lucky charms back,  String Ting founder Rachel Steed-Middleton tells BAZAAR.com. “The ‘smartphone-is-my-life’ way of being is more current and of the times, so this is really a very new and modern-day category of accessorizing,” she says.

Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, and Kaia Gerber have all been spotted with String Tings dangling from their phones.“Being more connected to our devices naturally makes us think about what they look like and how we can personalize them,” Bass agrees. “With Hang On, we’ve tried to capitalize on this trend but also reshape its narrative.” The brand offers two-for-one discounts on its charms—to encourage shoppers to buy one for a friend, and remind them to stay in touch.

The 27 Best Closet and Jewelry Organizers for Decluttering Your Space,"Usually, when Phoebe Bridgers talks about the moon, she's singing to a group of crying fans (I am, admittedly, one of them) who are mouthing the words to her ""Moon Song."" But last week, she could be found talking about astronomy in a not-heart-wrenching context—while wearing Chanel jewelry inspired by the stars. Standing underneath a crescent moon on a stage in Los Angeles, she introduced the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who were performing for Chanel’s guests at a dinner celebrating the launch of the 1932 jewelry collection, which is the second one ever released by the brand. The crowd cheered, but the 18-karat Coco Crush earrings and bracelet adorning Bridgers’s earlobes and wrist were beautiful enough that they could have elicited tears (of jealousy). Phoebe Bridgers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinIt has been 90 years since Gabrielle Chanel designed Bijoux de Diamants, the first high jewelry collection in history. It was created three years after Black Thursday pushed the world into the Great Depression, and Chanel was determined to create something that could shine through the turmoil. The 50-piece collection was made of white and yellow diamonds set in platinum and yellow gold, with 22 pieces inspired by specific constellations. “Nothing could be better for forgetting the crisis than feasting one’s eyes on beautiful new things,” she said of the collection. And so it feels fitting that in 2022, nearly three years after the entire world stood still for the pandemic, the fashion house she built would respond to our somber times with something just as sumptuous.More From Harper's BAZAARThe Yeah Yeah Yeahs performing at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinLike the original Bijoux de Diamants collection, the design of 1932 is harmonized around three symbols: the comet, the moon, and the sun.

Pat MartinSinger Maggie Rogers, who also recently graduated from Harvard’s Divinity School, wore five rings from the collection but said the shooting star Comète ear cuff in 18-karat gold was her favorite. On the Chanel black carpet, Rogers mentioned how she felt a kinship with Gabrielle over her affinity for outer space: “[The cosmos] is something that has always resonated with me and is very apparent and present in my musical work.” Gossip Girl’s Whitney Peak said the collection made her feel like a “superstar” before joking, “I feel like I shouldn’t be wearing it. I don’t know how they let me get away with this!” and then grasping the 1932 Comète Couture necklace in 18-karat gold and diamonds around her neck.

What makes it extraordinary is its ability to transform: The halos detach to become brooches, and the central row of diamonds becomes a bracelet, converting the necklace into a shorter version. Thirteen other pieces from the 1932 collection also have the ability to transform in a similar manner, allowing the wearer to make new diamond constellations around their wrists and necks.Guests dining at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinMany of the pieces were made without clasps, something Gabrielle Chanel openly disliked. “I detest clasps! I’ve done away with clasps! Yet my jewelry is transformable,” she said in an interview in 1932 after the “Bijoux de Diamants” exhibition. She strived to design pieces that offered flexibility to busy women with full lives, and that didn’t impede their freedom. And as the jewelry-spangled guests left their cares behind to dance under a canopy of baby’s breath, it was evident that the new 1932 collection stays true to her vision.Tara GonzalezTara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.

9 Micro Trends from New York Fashion Week,"Prada has never done things by the book. The brand has been creating the world's most desirable fashion pieces since their start over one hundred years ago, going from making humble leather goods to being one of the biggest privately owned brands in the world. Now, the brand is expanding on their aesthetic universe with a daring introduction into fine jewelry. The inaugural collection, titled ETERNAL GOLD, marks both a commitment to beauty and to sustainable, circular fashion.Maya Hawke for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsAs Prada's first-ever fine jewelry offering, ETERNAL GOLD is a first in many aspects. It's also the world's first fine jewelry collection made entirely with recycled gold, collected using the industry's most rigorous standards set by the Responsible Jewelry Council. Prada is also the first company to expand on diamond traceability, making every single carat count traceable down to its origins. The complete transparency of every material used in their jewelry, from sourcing to cutting to setting, is a radical step in the direction of honest production for an otherwise murky process. Somi Jeon for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsThe jewelry is a reflection of Prada's impact on the industry and a continuation of their efforts to creating beautiful objects that stands the test of time, as all fine jewelry should. ETERNAL GOLD is rife with Pradaisms, with the instantly recognizable Prada triangle rendered as sleek earrings and pendants, but also imbued in clasp closures, and more subtly, in chain links and as the head and tail of the snake bracelet.  The snake bracelet itself may at first recall other serpent bracelets, but finds its own voice with the sneaky Prada triangle and smooth, unvarnished gold. Heart pendants take on an edgy effect with the triangle chainlink it sits on.More From Harper's BAZAARCourtesyCourtesyPrada chose three voices of our time to don this foundational collection, representing where Prada is now and where it can go. Amanda Gorman, award-winning poet and activist, Maya Hawke, singer/songwriter, actress, and model, and Somi Jeon, musician, become one with the gold, immortalized in gold negative renderings by David Sims. The jewelry and its campaign represent the future of a wholly responsible planet that isn't sacrificing purity and beauty at its demise. The act of both looking good and doing good is something all brands should aim toward.From: ELLE USKevin LeBlancKevin LeBlanc is the Fashion Associate at ELLE Magazine.

25 Minimalist Jewelry Finds You Can Buy on Amazon,"If looking stylish in sneakers and your boyfriend's button-down is a skill set, Kaia Gerber is the master.Yesterday, the model was seen walking around Los Angeles looking comfortable in an effortlessly cool ensemble that brought to mind the now-viral coastal grandmother trend. The outfit consisted of an oversized striped gray button-down, a cropped white tank top, and loose-fitting black trousers. She finished the look with the black Adidas sneakers every model seems to be wearing, a green handbag, and brown oval sunglasses.Gerber wore no makeup and kept her straight her down for the outing.BACKGRIDWhen she's not looking glamorous on the Cannes Film Festival red carpet with boyfriend Austin Butler, Gerber is showing off her relaxed model-off-duty style on low-key dates.For a screening of Elvis in New York City this June, Gerber looked casual but chic in a navy top, black miniskirt, and matching leather blazer. She finished the look with a pair of high socks and white sneakers, and accessorized with her green shoulder bag and black Ray-Ban sunglasses. And on a lunch date with Butler this August, the model wore an open cobalt blue button-down over a cropped tank in the same hue, relaxed black trousers, and her go-to black Adidas sneakers. She accessorized with the same oval sunglasses and green handbag she carried yesterday, along with diamond stud earrings.This week, the stylish star released her own collection of wardrobe essentials with Zara (available to shop since October 4). The drop includes more than 30 pieces, including leather trenches, white tanks, and slouchy trousers—very on brand for Gerber.Now, the model is also stepping into acting.

All the Spring 2022 Makeup Trends We Can't Wait to Wear,"Is any woman as synonymous with another creature as Mariah Carey is with a butterfly?This week, the singer celebrated the 30th anniversary of the release of her groundbreaking album Butterfly, and now she celebrates the arrival of her collaboration with the jeweler Chopard, which launches in stores and online today, September 16. The pieces, a mix of butterflies rendered in diamonds on rings, bracelets, earrings, and a breathtaking statement necklace, commemorate Carey’s  longtime affinity for the creature who helped her conceptualize her life as an independent artist at the top of a male-dominated music industry. She describes the process of seeing and wearing the pieces, while simultaneously celebrating “my favorite album that I’ve done,” as an emotional experience. “It’s a major moment, and it’s a full circle moment,” she says. Here she tells us about conceptualizing the collection, her daily jewelry wardrobe, and how she will wear the pieces.Harper’s Bazaar: I want to start by talking about this incredible butterfly necklace. Mariah Carey: Oh my gosh.HB: The butterfly, of course, is this incredibly significant symbol of transformation for you. But seeing the butterfly rendered in diamonds reminded me of how dazzling they are. They’re the most beautiful living creatures. And I wondered if you learned anything about the butterfly, seeing it rendered in diamonds. The enduring symbol of the butterfly—I mean, we can go on and on about different people's interpretations and feelings. My own personal feelings are so very specific to my album Butterfly and that period of my life, which we are celebrating the anniversary of this year, [coincidentally] at the same time that this is all happening, right? Because we've been working on this [with Chopard] for two years together, and it happened by accident [that] we’re re-releasing the Butterfly album, which is my favorite album that I’ve done.And yes, I have a very specific relationship with the butterfly and just the whole metamorphosis of it. The way that I had to come through a very difficult time in my life and, you know, like they say, you’ve gotta go through something to get something. I had to get to that place where I felt empowered enough to metaphorically fly and be free from that place where I was. I started out in this industry as such a young girl in a really difficult world, dominated by men. I wrote this song as I was leaving this mansion that I had paid for half of, and [where] I had sort of created my own little prison, not really deliberately, but it ended up feeling that way. And I was leaving and I wrote the lyrics and the melody to [the song “Butterfly”]: Spread your wings and prepare to fly / for you have become a butterfly. And so that’s always stuck with me. I’ve made many albums since then, but it’s just very specific to me. So to see this magnificent butterfly necklace, and the ring—I mean, it was so much to even be able to say, I collaborated on this. To be able to admire the craft—I don’t want to say “craftsmanship.” Please give me another word.HB: The creation, the artistry?The artistry! That’s what it is. Just to be able to collaborate with Chopard and doing this collection is a humongous honor. I’m just here, ready to put some diamonds on and hang out. Whatever! Courtesy of Chopard.HB: What is your daily jewelry wardrobe? Are we wearing the butterfly ring every day and the necklace for special occasions? Or is there a different routine here?I am not really one for routines of any sort. I’m not a dancer. I don’t really like to follow rules. So I would wear any piece on any occasion. But right now i’m wearing a bracelet that my daughter made for me that says “Lamily” on it, which is an homage to my fans made of little beads and elastic, with some diamond bracelets. I would wear any piece from the collection in a casual moment, or more specifically the Happy Butterfly collection, which I love so much. I think they’re gonna look gorgeous stacked with even just a T-shirt and jeans, leggings, a simple dress. There’s just really great pieces that are attainable, as well as those gorgeous—I don’t find them over the top, some might say they are; they’re major—pieces that I live for.They are really major. And they feel so you. I can see you wearing this incredible butterfly necklace with a T-shirt, or these enormous leaf earrings.I would do that! I’m so ready to wear those. When Caroline [Scheufele, the president of Chopard] was evolving and creating them, she was explaining them to me and I knew exactly what she meant, but when I saw them, I was losing it. I mean, they’re just sick. It’s beyond. They’re so good. [Laughs.]Sounds like you and Caroline had good chemistry.I feel like Caroline probably has incredible chemistry with anyone cuz she’s so fun and carefree. I love that about her. She’s also an artist and a businesswoman, and to work with her to make this collection together, [it feels] even more extra special because it was my idea and I was able to watch it happen.Courtesy of Chopard.Would you say it’s true that diamonds are a girl’s best friend?Well, considering the people I know, for sure. Maybe the exception of one or two. You know, at the end of the day, they’re not going to steer you wrong! Do you feel like jewelry plays an important part in your life spiritually? It can be armor, but it also reflects the essential feminine aspects of who you are.That’s interesting. I’ve never thought of it that way. There were little things, little pieces that I’ve had throughout my life, where they did have their own—I wouldn’t say spiritual, but they had a sort of special significance to me where I would keep them on no matter what. Swimming, whatever I was doing, I would keep them on. Because they were that special to me. And at one point I lost a piece of jewelry that I loved so much, and it wasn’t even that it was a major thing. It just meant something to me. But with this collection, everything means so much to me that I’m just excited to share it with the world.

Rihanna Looks Gorgeous in a Sheer Gown and Gold Body Jewelry,"Katie Holmes's classic street style has set its sights on the pants trend du jour: low-rise jeans. Yesterday, the Dawson's Creek alum was spotted out and about in New York City running errands while wearing an effortlessly stylish look. Her breezy, late-summer ensemble consisted of a blush pink spaghetti-strap cami tucked into a pair of baggy low-rise jeans in a light wash. She continued the minimalist approach with the rest of her outfit, wearing olive green flip-flops and carrying a maroon shoulder bag from A.P.C., eschewing jewelry entirely.BACKGRIDBaggy pants have made cameos in Holmes's street style before.Earlier this month, she made a cozy appearance in the city, accompanied by boyfriend Bobby Wooten III, while wearing an oversized slouchy pair of black trousers. She paired the statement pants with a classic light gray knit sweater with a red-and-cream pattern across the chest and shoulders, and finished the look with a brown leather cross-body bag.Back in June, the actress talked to BAZAAR.com about curating her sense of style, both on and off set.""I directed two films back-to-back this year, and I did the costumes as well, which made me appreciate my friends who are costume designers and all the costume designers I've worked with in the past,"" Holmes said of her work on Rare Objects and a still-untitled romance movie based in Connecticut. ""It made me appreciate silhouettes and cuts and color in a way I thought I had, but when you put it on camera, when you are trying to tell a story, you can see how clothing can do a lot of the work for you.""Of her personal wardrobe, she added, ""I love my T-shirts, and I love my vintage T-shirts.

Chanel Just Unveiled Its Most Opulent Jewelry in 90 Years,"Worn by celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, Kendall Jenner, Tracee Ellis Ross, Millie Bobby Brown, and more, the '90s- and Y2K-inspired braided tendril trend has only increased in popularity since its reemergence during the 2022 festival season. ""The tendril trend has always been an easy way to add a little 'razzle-dazzle' to any updo,"" Erinn Courtney, a natural hair expert at StyleSeat and celebrity stylist, tells BAZAAR.com. Typically crafted as a set of smaller, face-framing braids, braided tendrils are an easy way to elevate a go-to bun or ponytail. You can also quickly enhance a salon-quality blowout or beachy waves by adding a second pair of braids near the ears for a summery, carefree hair look.View full post on InstagramView full post on InstagramWhen it comes to the styling essentials needed for a braided tendril updo versus wearing your hair completely down, professionals say there isn't much difference in the products and tools to keep in your arsenal. ""Re-creating this look at home is pretty simple,"" says celebrity stylist and Mane Addicts artist Irinel de León, who counts stars like Bella Hadid, Chrissy Teigen, and Hailey Bieber as clients.

""For updos in particular, I love using a little barber's brush to smooth hair into a cute bun or pony,"" she adds. ""I also recommend applying gel around the perimeter of the hair, brushing it upwards, then securing it with a hair tie.

Kaia Gerber Puts a Model-Off-Duty Spin on the Coastal Grandmother Trend,"Ahead of the premiere of her much-awaited film Blonde, in which she portrays Marilyn Monroe, Ana de Armas is diving into a world Monroe knew quite a lot about: diamonds.The film and fashion icon famously sang ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" in the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and was known for her elegant style and love of high jewelry (remember when she wore the spectacular yellow diamond necklace dubbed The Moon of Baroda?). At the time, however, the diamond industry was seen as untouchable and unreachable for both ordinary buyers and small jewelry designers, and only big names, such as De Beers and Tiffany & Co., got the business and the notoriety. At the same time, conflict diamonds and diamond smuggling became real problems.Now, the Natural Diamond Council, along with brand ambassador de Armas, is looking to change that by backing young designers from around the world and educating buyers on the current state of the industry, which is moving toward a more sustainable and inclusive future.More From Harper's BAZAAR""I started working with the NDC in 2020, and I think it was a process for me of learning,"" de Armas tells BAZAAR.com at the NDC's launch event on June 14 at the Beekman Hotel penthouse in New York City, adding that she got to see how women in Botswana ran diamond mines and handled tractors, and essentially got to know the community behind the precious stones.    Vincenzo DiminoOn Tuesday, the NDC debuted the collections of the second class of artists from its Emerging Designers Diamond Initiative, which launched in January 2021 with $1 million of diamond credit dedicated to supporting emerging BIPOC jewelry designers, in partnership with Lorraine Schwartz.Per the NDC, ""The diamond industry is historically a generational and handshake industry where emerging designers without prior connections often experience barriers to entry. The program sets to level the playing field by providing direct, career-lasting relationships with diamantaires by underwriting $1 million in diamond credit in the designers’ own names. Industry education and resources, mentor pairings, and financial support for production and CAD designs are NDC’s efforts to help create a more equitable future.""Vincenzo DiminoDe Armas, wearing a brilliant ring and necklace from Dorian Webb and a ring from Heart the Stones by Halle Millien, says it's powerful the way in which the NDC is supporting—and financially backing—artists in the community who need the space to simply do what they're good at.""As a minority myself, I remember the days when I just wanted the chance to be in the room. I wanted to just be there. Give me the opportunity and I'll show you what I can offer,"" de Armas says. ""The fact that they're mentoring and supporting and opening the doors to relationships and careers and resources for these guys and giving them the credit is incredible.""The Cuban actress is no stranger to red-carpet glamour, and she has been dripped in diamonds for roles several times over the course of her film career, but she says the passion and originality of the up-and-coming jewelry designers' diamond pieces prove there are still ways to break boundaries in the diamond world.""It's the new generations who are going to bring a new take on jewelry. We don't have to keep wearing or interpreting jewelry in the same way,"" she says.Vincenzo DiminoJewelry, and diamonds in particular, the actress agrees, can be incredibly personal. They can be much more than just beautiful, high-priced pieces we like to look at. A jewelry collection can be passed down for generations, it can carry different meanings and morph and be modernized through the years—take Duchess Kate's inherited jewelry from Princess Diana, for example.De Armas says there is one piece she bought herself that she cherishes above all others: an antique ring that reminds her of her grandmother.""I had a ring from my grandma that I'm pretty sure was not a diamond, but it was this dark red stone with little things around it, and I lost it at the airport and I was so, so, so, so sad,"" she recalls in a conversation with BAZAAR. ""And years went by, and then I was shooting a movie and we were shooting on the street and I bumped into an antique store and I found the version of that ring—same color, but this time real diamonds—and I had to get it. It wasn't my grandma's ring, but it just reminds me of her. I have it here, actually, because I always wear it."" Maybe not as meaningful but equally dazzling were the jewels de Armas got to wear while filming the 2021 James Bond film No Time to Die with Daniel Craig.""That was beautiful—such an incredible touch for the character. Everything was so simple but I just felt like the jewelry really matched her personality: so sparkly and shiny and happy,"" de Armas says.Vincenzo DiminoWalking around the NDC event, where the young designers showcased their diamond creations, the actress couldn't keep her eyes off Birthright Foundry's Heritage Diamond Ula Nifo choker, crafted from 18-karat yellow gold and natural white diamonds but inspired by whale tooth necklaces from Samoa. The Ula Nifo necklace was worn by Samoan chiefs and their children in ancient times, and signified wealth and status, designer Constance Polamalu explains.""It's just so different,"" de Armas says.Grant Mobley, a diamond and fine jewelry expert at the NDC, tells BAZAAR how rare and exciting it is to see a high-jewelry piece so influenced by a designer's underrepresented culture, and yet so wearable today.""If you think back to these incredible Samoan jewelry designs with the amazing necklace collars from well over 100 years ago, she's turning that into something that makes sense for the modern day, and she's also doing that with fine jewelry materials: gold, diamonds,"" he says. ""It's something that might've been worn hundreds of years ago by her ancestors, but she's making it something that she would wear and that you would see on the red carpet.""The collections of the latest EDDI class of designers—Casey Perez, Corey Anthony Jones, Lana Ogilvie (Sabre Jewelry), Mckenzie Liautaud, Halle Millien (Heart the Stones), and Ruben Manuel—will launch this Friday, June 17, on 1stDibs.

10 Winter 2022 Bag Trends to Start Shopping Now,"Storing your jewelry can be an afterthought to wearing your jewelry.

The 10 Winter Nail Trends We Can't Wait to Wear,"Lately I wonder if we’re living through a mass psychosis expressing itself through trend reporting. If it felt a year ago like anything goes—that the restrictions and trauma of the pandemic highlighted fashion and self-expression as a new outlet for freedom—increasingly it seems that there are a thousand trends happening at once. In just the past month, I have read stories about a new twist on the girlboss trend called “that girl,” a trend in which women really enjoy themselves, and a trend in which women enjoy themselves a little, plus “dinocore,” “clowncore,” and “twee.” On TikTok, trend forecasting has become the new influencer hustle, almost a trend itself; creators who can string together photographic evidence with a pithy and compelling monologue are performing a kind of competitive prophecy. And the platform’s algorithm seems to favor this sort of information sharing: the more ridiculous the prediction, the more traction it gains, and the more predictions we are fed. In the meantime, fast fashion brands like Shein have sped production to such a pace that they can both predict and reflect these trends, making them feel all the more real while we ping pong through “feels” and “vibes” with no aesthetic compass. Even runway fashion, which is supposed to move at a slower, biannual speed, has joined this rat race, as designers pack their shows with potential viral moments and styles that are replicable by anyone with a little ingenuity and a pair of scissors. The tempo of fashion makes everything feel quick, carefree, and, sometimes, unfortunately, even careless. Mostly it seems that people are doing things humans have done for most of the past century—relaxing, working hard, having martinis, not having martinis—but now we cannot resist the urge to package them into something that feels more meaningful than mere consumer choices.Jerry Lorenzo, the 44-year-old designer behind the brand Fear of God, is a man who has started many trends himself (real trends, that is). When he began his brand almost a decade ago, it was a luxury cornerstone of the hypebeast movement, which often encourages a cut-throat, product-driven style of consumerism. Lorenzo worked on an early season of Yeezy alongside then-Vetements designer Demna, and, after making T-shirts for Justin Bieber’s “Purpose” tour, helped turn merch into meaningful clothes. He was a close friend of and collaborator with the late Virgil Abloh, whose brand Off-White propelled streetwear to the forefront of fashion, and his sneakers and sweatpants remain staples in hip corridors of Los Angeles and New York. But lately, Lorenzo has been on a different kind of fashion journey. In early 2020 he collaborated with Ermenegildo Zegna’s Alessandro Sartori for a collection that shifted menswear’s inner circle’s attitude around suiting, making it feel less performative and more like a staple. And now his collections, which arrive on his own time rather than seasonally, serve a slower, even higher purpose. Today, he is releasing a new collection, his first in nearly two years. As he worked on it, he said in a video interview late last week, he asked himself of every garment, “Is this timeless?”“I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now,” he said. “And I want to provide a safe space for someone that wants to step outside of that, but can still step into that conversation with everyone else that’s of ‘the now’ and feel of ‘the now,’ but not have to be so on trend.” Instead, what he wants his clothing to do is help his customers “feel the confidence. I want them to feel sophisticated, but I want them to feel the freedom to be themselves and know that it’s not the trend that validates you. It’s the individual that you are.” Lorenzo calls this collection Eternal. And while the clothing is a natural progression of the easy elegance of the collections he dropped in late summer and fall of 2020, it seems quite radical, to me, to proclaim you want to defy the trend cycle and try to make something that has lasting value. It seems so obvious, to try to float above it all, and yet the intoxicating quest for relevance has made it a rare impulse. Lorenzo is almost dipping into the realm of slow fashion—of designers with far less recognizable names who rarely stage fashion shows, like the 19th-century inspired work of Paul Harnden, the simple French cottons of Casey Casey, or the heady beauty of Elena Dawson. They make clothing that is intentionally hard to find and difficult to make. Lorenzo hasn’t gone that far, of course, and he has in his corner the fact that his clothing is meant to make you feel as comfortable in a suit as you are in your favorite sweatshirt. That means it has the potential to transcend the cognoscenti customer of slow fashion brands, or perhaps convert recovering hypebeasts into cognoscenti. He is designing with incredible thoughtfulness, even integrity–almost like a novel. “I approach it like a book or a music album,” said Lorenzo of putting together collections. “I don't really approach it in terms of seasons and seasonality. I approach it like, Hey, do I have something to say? Do I have the resources to say what I wanna say in the best way?” He remains independently owned–he also has a partnership with Adidas, where he serves as the head of strategy for their basketball category—and his resources are just catching up to his point of view, as he put it. He’s been able to move 80% of his production to Italy, for example. “And so hopefully each time we have something to say, it’s better than the last thing we said.” Lorenzo, of course, isn’t the only designer to prize continual improvement over novelty. The Row’s Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen come to mind, and Lorenzo, like The Row and other influential American aesthetes, is particularly drawn, lately, to the 1980s and ’90s designs of Giorgio Armani. His cascades of beige in flowing, almost spiritually understated cuts wrote a new script for minimalism. If Prada was cerebral, edgy, and obscure, and Calvin Klein was sexy, Armani was, just as Lorenzo said, a man of confidence, whose clothing blessed its wearers with a feeling of monastic chic weightlessness. “I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now.”In Eternal, the cuts are generous without swamping their wearer in fabric; the tones are bones, milky beiges, and greyish whites; and nearly all the pants blur the line between a structured trouser and a cozy sweatpant. You can see how a person dressed in these clothes might calm a room of investors or subtly change the energy in a coffee shop line. “I am in fashion, and I do love to present myself a certain way,” Lorenzo mused. “But that’s always been something that is understated. It’s always been something that isn’t loud and doesn’t call for attention. As quiet as I want to be in a room, I also want to be competent, you know?” Like Armani—and again, like The Row—Lorenzo is thinking about how his clothing might provide solutions, not only to the holes in your wardrobe but to your own questions about your sense of self. How do you wear a suit, which has different proportions and fabrics than a hoodie or track pants, and still feel like yourself? “That’s what I’m always chasing, you know? How can I be always sophisticated in the way that I present myself, but honest, and relaxed and comfortable?” Lorenzo’s evolution as a designer over the past decade, from a Los Angeles DJ to a new hero in intentional clothing creation, has been one of fashion’s most interesting. By staying independent, he’s allowed himself the time to grow and explore that investors or big luxury house appointments rarely afford. Too often, a designer’s references are too readily apparent, too surface—Ralph Lauren’s Polo line, or Annie Leibowitz’s images for The Gap, or the wackadoo spirit of 1980s couture that seems to have captured the imagination of many young womenswear designers in New York. In fact, prior to his dalliance with Zegna, Lorenzo spoke about wanting to build a brand like Lauren’s. But Lorenzo has a new modesty about him, and his clothing feels intimate in a way that Lauren’s, which is much more like a worshipful encyclopedia of American style, simply cannot. We talked about how opting out of trendiness can be quite boring—depending on how many viscose trouser-wearing influencers you follow on Instagram, you might say it’s even something of a trend itself—and how he’s tweaked his pieces, and played with fabrics, to give his pieces some heart and some personality. Changing the shoulder on a jacket from a past collection to make it feel less 1980s, for example. The result is that these are real clothes, for someone who is not trying to create a look for a moment in time, but who believes fashion can improve your life in small but significant ways.Open GalleryRachel TashjianRachel Tashjian is the Fashion News Director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.

The 19 Best Ballet Flats That Transcend Shoe Trends,"No one does glamour quite like Anya Taylor-Joy. So, to no one's surprise, The Queen's Gambit star looked incredible at the 73rd annual Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles last night.

Tiffany and Co. Tiffany and Co.Taylor-Joy's gown for the evening was embellished with two of the luxury jeweler's Elsa Peretti Diamonds by the Yard platinum necklaces elegantly draped down the actress's back— a mesmerizing look that was inspired by classic movie stars from Old Hollywood's past. She also wore platinum diamond starburst earrings, a yellow sapphire and baguette diamond bracelet from the brand's Blue Book Collection, and two major statement rings: an over-17-carat yellow sapphire diamond and a stunning platinum vine-shaped ring.  Tiffany and Co.Tiffany and Co.The actress's breathtaking beauty look for the night was equally dramatic, with Taylor Joy opting for a matte complexion, flushed cheeks, neutral eye shadow, wispy lashes, and vibrant red lips. She wore her hair in a vintage-inspired, delicately styled bouffant, but added a modern, kitschy touch with a bright-yellow manicure as well. Taylor-Joy's red-carpet look was easily one of the standouts of the evening, winning over social media and best-dressed lists alike (including ours) for its fresh and timeless approach to red-carpet style and glamour.

Katie Holmes Is Fully Embracing Fall's Latest Pants Trend,"MoAna Luu has spent her professional life building brands, from designing boutique hotels to serving as chief content and creative officer at Essence. But after contracting Covid-19 in March 2020, Luu decided to refocus on a new brand-building effort—one that’s entirely her own. That project is ManLuu, a line of luxury jewelry paying homage to Luu’s Creole heritage—a blend of African, Indian, French, and Caribbean traditions—and Martinique’s long tradition of jewelry-making. ManLuu arrives today at Nordstrom for its official, 21-item debut following a soft online launch this summer. ManLuu is composed of gender neutral earrings, bracelets, and rings in 18k gold vermeil and sterling silver. Nods to Creole jewelry tradition emerge through ManLuu’s use of exaggerated geometric shapes and signature woven patterns (an octagonal hoop with webbed inlays here, a chunky beaded bracelet there). ""The craftsmanship is something that is so delicate, when you see it you know you have a precious piece already,"" Luu says.More From Harper's BAZAARSome of the designer's earliest introductions to Creole craftsmanship came from her grandparents’ jewelry store in Fort-de-France, Martinique, Luu tells BAZAAR.com. But ManLuu’s devotion to quality is inspired by even earlier references, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. At that time, Black people could not become property owners, so they invested in gold jewelry heirlooms to pass down among generations. Luu says that ManLuu shares the power of this story, one that many people may not know, through each piece.MoAna Luu at the ManLuu atelier in New York City.ManLuuManLuu’s interpretation of heirloom jewelry had resonated long before this week’s Nordstrom launch. Gwyneth Paltrow, Mary J. Blige, and Maye Musk are a few of its early fans. Cardi B. even wore ManLuu bangles to announce her second pregnancy earlier this year—a special stamp of approval for the brand, Luu tells us. Joining forces with a large retailer like Nordstrom is, in some ways, even more significant than those celebrity endorsements. ""As a Black female designer and founder, I believe it's important that heritage brands welcome new creators and support them taking their place in the luxury market,"" Luu explains. ""This is a big step, not just for me, but for all of us.""While ManLuu's approach to luxury references centuries-old jewelry traditions, its use of eco-friendly materials is thoroughly 2021. Many pieces are crafted with recycled metals; later on, ManLuu will also incorporate lab-grown diamonds. Luu couldn't imagine starting a new label without incorporating conscious design techniques: “Sustainability is something that, today, is mandatory in any business."" By balancing meaningful history with modern design, ManLuu is an alternative to the throwaway jewelry sold, well, nearly everywhere. “Fast fashion was nice,” Luu says, “but now it’s time for pieces you want to keep.” And one day, pass down.Shop Manluu at NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$770 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Classic Beaded Necklace$2,650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Open Ring$600 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Cuff Bracelet$2,800 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$370 at NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$900 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Ear Jackets$1,000 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$570 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Embossed Ring$650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Long Beaded Necklace$4,200 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$470 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$1,100 at NordstromCredit: NordstromHalie LeSavageHalie LeSavage is the fashion commerce editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, where she covers everything from emerging designers to viral products to must-shop sales events.

Carly Cushnie Collaborates on a Sweet Aquamarine Jewelry Collection,"No one can take a time-out from the Y2K fashion revival. Not even our iPhones. Like bucket hats and platform flip flops before them, phone straps of the early aughts variety are having a renaissance. Think of these attachable lanyards like the camp jewelry trend, but for your phone. The plainest phone straps start with rainbow-colored resin beads and get kitschier from there. Entire indie brands are dedicated to beaded phone straps, with String Ting, GriGri, and Hang On credited in mirror selfies across Instagram. Established accessories players are catching on, with versions appearing at Roxanne Assoulin and Lele Sadoughi. View full post on InstagramAlex Bass, founder at phone strap seller Hang On, says Y2K nostalgia is a big part of her brand. Hang On’s aesthetic harkens back to the days when cell phones were a novelty and personalizing them was a compulsion—the more glitter, the better. In Bass’s case, she stuck “stickers and rhinestones on every square centimeter of the phone, à la Carrie Bradshaw.”More From Harper's BAZAARBut there’s more to the phone strap trend than 2000 calling to give our lucky charms back,  String Ting founder Rachel Steed-Middleton tells BAZAAR.com. “The ‘smartphone-is-my-life’ way of being is more current and of the times, so this is really a very new and modern-day category of accessorizing,” she says.

Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, and Kaia Gerber have all been spotted with String Tings dangling from their phones.“Being more connected to our devices naturally makes us think about what they look like and how we can personalize them,” Bass agrees. “With Hang On, we’ve tried to capitalize on this trend but also reshape its narrative.” The brand offers two-for-one discounts on its charms—to encourage shoppers to buy one for a friend, and remind them to stay in touch.

Fall 2022's 5 Best Jewelry Trends Are Unexpected and Bold,"Katie Kova is petite, quietly spoken, and very chic (think simple, understated style that conveys a quiet sort of elegance). Her newly launched fine jewelry label, Kova, follows in much the same vein. ""My jewelry is 100% wearable, stackable, mixable, and day-to-night viable,"" she says. ""I wear it with a T-shirt and flats and with a cocktail dress and stilettos.""Inspired by the 20th-century Russian art movement Suprematism (invented by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich, it was one of the earliest and most radical developments in abstract art), Kova's pieces possess the same sort of graphic, linear construction and minimalist feel as her favorite artworks. An ear cuff features circles and zig zag lines embedded with dozens of black and white pave diamonds, while a pair of triangular earrings have slight differences in each side. ""At Kova we see jewelry as a form of wearable creation,"" she says. ""We begin with analysis, researching shapes, lines, concepts, references, textures, inspirations, fits, and even variable degrees of shine—that´s how nerdy we can be. It´s all about the conceptual and creative challenges of launching a line that's cohesive, unique, and by all means; beautiful."" Sally GriffithsFor the Moscow-born, London-based designer, jewelry wasn't her first calling. Rather, she studied business before leaping into the world of accessories. ""I always knew that I´d start my own project and that it would be a creative one. Even when I was studying business I was interested in architecture and design,"" she explains. ""Jewelry is my true passion. The minute my grandfather gave me my first piece of jewelry when I was 14, I became an ad hoc jewelry researcher. Kova is the result of that informal education and my very formal business studies."" And while her homeland provides much of the inspiration, Kova's London base also delivers plenty of influences. ""Russia gave me a vast cultural legacy: The unparalleled graphic influence of artists Rodchenko, Malevich, and Kandinsky—to name just three. London on the other hand stimulated my creativity as an individual. It´s a city of creativity, talent, and brains that has made my vision so much more versatile.""More From Harper's BAZAARHer sculptural, minimalist pieces are also a step away from traditional fine jewelry, especially those that she grew up around. ""In Russia, fine jewelry is passed from generation to generation so it´s highly valued. Collecting fine jewelry has been a tradition in my family for generations. My favorite piece is the Tiffany & Co. bracelet that my grandfather gave me when I was 14. I still wear it all the time. It's not about trends, it´s about design integrity and the best stones."" In a rapidly changing accessories market, Kova's pieces personify a new approach to fine jewelry—unlike traditional fine jewels there's no need to keep them locked in a vault or only worn on special occasions. ""Women today understand fine jewelry as a wearable accessory rather than just an investment,"" agrees Kova. Her own personal approach to fashion and style is indicative of the change. ""I am not a girly girl but I´m not masculine either. I appreciate femininity but not in its literal instance. You won´t see me in ruffles and bows, you'll see me in pieces that are understated and elegant. I love wearing clothes that empower you, that give you confidence.""Read more from Tara from PROFYLES.com."

Real Fashion For the Era of Fake Trends,"Usually, when Phoebe Bridgers talks about the moon, she's singing to a group of crying fans (I am, admittedly, one of them) who are mouthing the words to her ""Moon Song."" But last week, she could be found talking about astronomy in a not-heart-wrenching context—while wearing Chanel jewelry inspired by the stars. Standing underneath a crescent moon on a stage in Los Angeles, she introduced the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who were performing for Chanel’s guests at a dinner celebrating the launch of the 1932 jewelry collection, which is the second one ever released by the brand. The crowd cheered, but the 18-karat Coco Crush earrings and bracelet adorning Bridgers’s earlobes and wrist were beautiful enough that they could have elicited tears (of jealousy). Phoebe Bridgers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinIt has been 90 years since Gabrielle Chanel designed Bijoux de Diamants, the first high jewelry collection in history. It was created three years after Black Thursday pushed the world into the Great Depression, and Chanel was determined to create something that could shine through the turmoil. The 50-piece collection was made of white and yellow diamonds set in platinum and yellow gold, with 22 pieces inspired by specific constellations. “Nothing could be better for forgetting the crisis than feasting one’s eyes on beautiful new things,” she said of the collection. And so it feels fitting that in 2022, nearly three years after the entire world stood still for the pandemic, the fashion house she built would respond to our somber times with something just as sumptuous.More From Harper's BAZAARThe Yeah Yeah Yeahs performing at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinLike the original Bijoux de Diamants collection, the design of 1932 is harmonized around three symbols: the comet, the moon, and the sun. Chanel muses like Marion Cotillard, Lori Harvey, Greta Lee, and Whitney Peak were in attendance at the West Hollywood celebration, and, like Bridgers, were also layered in pieces from the 1932 collection named after the cosmos. Maggie Rogers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection. Pat MartinSinger Maggie Rogers, who also recently graduated from Harvard’s Divinity School, wore five rings from the collection but said the shooting star Comète ear cuff in 18-karat gold was her favorite. On the Chanel black carpet, Rogers mentioned how she felt a kinship with Gabrielle over her affinity for outer space: “[The cosmos] is something that has always resonated with me and is very apparent and present in my musical work.” Gossip Girl’s Whitney Peak said the collection made her feel like a “superstar” before joking, “I feel like I shouldn’t be wearing it. I don’t know how they let me get away with this!” and then grasping the 1932 Comète Couture necklace in 18-karat gold and diamonds around her neck. Whitney Peak at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinWhile there are 77 pieces in the collection, its signature piece is the Allure Céleste necklace, with round-cut diamonds, an oval sapphire of deep blue, and a weight of 55.5 carats. What makes it extraordinary is its ability to transform: The halos detach to become brooches, and the central row of diamonds becomes a bracelet, converting the necklace into a shorter version. Thirteen other pieces from the 1932 collection also have the ability to transform in a similar manner, allowing the wearer to make new diamond constellations around their wrists and necks.Guests dining at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinMany of the pieces were made without clasps, something Gabrielle Chanel openly disliked. “I detest clasps! I’ve done away with clasps! Yet my jewelry is transformable,” she said in an interview in 1932 after the “Bijoux de Diamants” exhibition. She strived to design pieces that offered flexibility to busy women with full lives, and that didn’t impede their freedom. And as the jewelry-spangled guests left their cares behind to dance under a canopy of baby’s breath, it was evident that the new 1932 collection stays true to her vision.Tara GonzalezTara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.

5 Jewelry Trends Worth Adding to Your Collection This Summer,"Prada has never done things by the book. The brand has been creating the world's most desirable fashion pieces since their start over one hundred years ago, going from making humble leather goods to being one of the biggest privately owned brands in the world. Now, the brand is expanding on their aesthetic universe with a daring introduction into fine jewelry. The inaugural collection, titled ETERNAL GOLD, marks both a commitment to beauty and to sustainable, circular fashion.Maya Hawke for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsAs Prada's first-ever fine jewelry offering, ETERNAL GOLD is a first in many aspects. It's also the world's first fine jewelry collection made entirely with recycled gold, collected using the industry's most rigorous standards set by the Responsible Jewelry Council. Prada is also the first company to expand on diamond traceability, making every single carat count traceable down to its origins. The complete transparency of every material used in their jewelry, from sourcing to cutting to setting, is a radical step in the direction of honest production for an otherwise murky process. Somi Jeon for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsThe jewelry is a reflection of Prada's impact on the industry and a continuation of their efforts to creating beautiful objects that stands the test of time, as all fine jewelry should. ETERNAL GOLD is rife with Pradaisms, with the instantly recognizable Prada triangle rendered as sleek earrings and pendants, but also imbued in clasp closures, and more subtly, in chain links and as the head and tail of the snake bracelet.  The snake bracelet itself may at first recall other serpent bracelets, but finds its own voice with the sneaky Prada triangle and smooth, unvarnished gold. Heart pendants take on an edgy effect with the triangle chainlink it sits on.More From Harper's BAZAARCourtesyCourtesyPrada chose three voices of our time to don this foundational collection, representing where Prada is now and where it can go. Amanda Gorman, award-winning poet and activist, Maya Hawke, singer/songwriter, actress, and model, and Somi Jeon, musician, become one with the gold, immortalized in gold negative renderings by David Sims. The jewelry and its campaign represent the future of a wholly responsible planet that isn't sacrificing purity and beauty at its demise. The act of both looking good and doing good is something all brands should aim toward.From: ELLE USKevin LeBlancKevin LeBlanc is the Fashion Associate at ELLE Magazine.

10 Hair Trends to Try for Summer 2022,"If looking stylish in sneakers and your boyfriend's button-down is a skill set, Kaia Gerber is the master.Yesterday, the model was seen walking around Los Angeles looking comfortable in an effortlessly cool ensemble that brought to mind the now-viral coastal grandmother trend. The outfit consisted of an oversized striped gray button-down, a cropped white tank top, and loose-fitting black trousers. She finished the look with the black Adidas sneakers every model seems to be wearing, a green handbag, and brown oval sunglasses.Gerber wore no makeup and kept her straight her down for the outing.BACKGRIDWhen she's not looking glamorous on the Cannes Film Festival red carpet with boyfriend Austin Butler, Gerber is showing off her relaxed model-off-duty style on low-key dates.For a screening of Elvis in New York City this June, Gerber looked casual but chic in a navy top, black miniskirt, and matching leather blazer. She finished the look with a pair of high socks and white sneakers, and accessorized with her green shoulder bag and black Ray-Ban sunglasses. And on a lunch date with Butler this August, the model wore an open cobalt blue button-down over a cropped tank in the same hue, relaxed black trousers, and her go-to black Adidas sneakers. She accessorized with the same oval sunglasses and green handbag she carried yesterday, along with diamond stud earrings.This week, the stylish star released her own collection of wardrobe essentials with Zara (available to shop since October 4).

The 27 Best Closet and Jewelry Organizers for Decluttering Your Space,"Is any woman as synonymous with another creature as Mariah Carey is with a butterfly?This week, the singer celebrated the 30th anniversary of the release of her groundbreaking album Butterfly, and now she celebrates the arrival of her collaboration with the jeweler Chopard, which launches in stores and online today, September 16. The pieces, a mix of butterflies rendered in diamonds on rings, bracelets, earrings, and a breathtaking statement necklace, commemorate Carey’s  longtime affinity for the creature who helped her conceptualize her life as an independent artist at the top of a male-dominated music industry. She describes the process of seeing and wearing the pieces, while simultaneously celebrating “my favorite album that I’ve done,” as an emotional experience. “It’s a major moment, and it’s a full circle moment,” she says. Here she tells us about conceptualizing the collection, her daily jewelry wardrobe, and how she will wear the pieces.Harper’s Bazaar: I want to start by talking about this incredible butterfly necklace. Mariah Carey: Oh my gosh.HB: The butterfly, of course, is this incredibly significant symbol of transformation for you. But seeing the butterfly rendered in diamonds reminded me of how dazzling they are. They’re the most beautiful living creatures. And I wondered if you learned anything about the butterfly, seeing it rendered in diamonds. The enduring symbol of the butterfly—I mean, we can go on and on about different people's interpretations and feelings. My own personal feelings are so very specific to my album Butterfly and that period of my life, which we are celebrating the anniversary of this year, [coincidentally] at the same time that this is all happening, right? Because we've been working on this [with Chopard] for two years together, and it happened by accident [that] we’re re-releasing the Butterfly album, which is my favorite album that I’ve done.And yes, I have a very specific relationship with the butterfly and just the whole metamorphosis of it. The way that I had to come through a very difficult time in my life and, you know, like they say, you’ve gotta go through something to get something. I had to get to that place where I felt empowered enough to metaphorically fly and be free from that place where I was. I started out in this industry as such a young girl in a really difficult world, dominated by men. I wrote this song as I was leaving this mansion that I had paid for half of, and [where] I had sort of created my own little prison, not really deliberately, but it ended up feeling that way. And I was leaving and I wrote the lyrics and the melody to [the song “Butterfly”]: Spread your wings and prepare to fly / for you have become a butterfly. And so that’s always stuck with me. I’ve made many albums since then, but it’s just very specific to me. So to see this magnificent butterfly necklace, and the ring—I mean, it was so much to even be able to say, I collaborated on this. To be able to admire the craft—I don’t want to say “craftsmanship.” Please give me another word.HB: The creation, the artistry?The artistry! That’s what it is. Just to be able to collaborate with Chopard and doing this collection is a humongous honor. I’m just here, ready to put some diamonds on and hang out. Whatever! Courtesy of Chopard.HB: What is your daily jewelry wardrobe? Are we wearing the butterfly ring every day and the necklace for special occasions? Or is there a different routine here?I am not really one for routines of any sort. I’m not a dancer. I don’t really like to follow rules. So I would wear any piece on any occasion. But right now i’m wearing a bracelet that my daughter made for me that says “Lamily” on it, which is an homage to my fans made of little beads and elastic, with some diamond bracelets. I would wear any piece from the collection in a casual moment, or more specifically the Happy Butterfly collection, which I love so much. I think they’re gonna look gorgeous stacked with even just a T-shirt and jeans, leggings, a simple dress. There’s just really great pieces that are attainable, as well as those gorgeous—I don’t find them over the top, some might say they are; they’re major—pieces that I live for.They are really major. And they feel so you. I can see you wearing this incredible butterfly necklace with a T-shirt, or these enormous leaf earrings.I would do that! I’m so ready to wear those. When Caroline [Scheufele, the president of Chopard] was evolving and creating them, she was explaining them to me and I knew exactly what she meant, but when I saw them, I was losing it. I mean, they’re just sick. It’s beyond. They’re so good. [Laughs.]Sounds like you and Caroline had good chemistry.I feel like Caroline probably has incredible chemistry with anyone cuz she’s so fun and carefree. I love that about her. She’s also an artist and a businesswoman, and to work with her to make this collection together, [it feels] even more extra special because it was my idea and I was able to watch it happen.Courtesy of Chopard.Would you say it’s true that diamonds are a girl’s best friend?Well, considering the people I know, for sure. Maybe the exception of one or two. You know, at the end of the day, they’re not going to steer you wrong! Do you feel like jewelry plays an important part in your life spiritually? It can be armor, but it also reflects the essential feminine aspects of who you are.That’s interesting. I’ve never thought of it that way. There were little things, little pieces that I’ve had throughout my life, where they did have their own—I wouldn’t say spiritual, but they had a sort of special significance to me where I would keep them on no matter what. Swimming, whatever I was doing, I would keep them on. Because they were that special to me. And at one point I lost a piece of jewelry that I loved so much, and it wasn’t even that it was a major thing. It just meant something to me. But with this collection, everything means so much to me that I’m just excited to share it with the world.

9 Micro Trends from New York Fashion Week,"Katie Holmes's classic street style has set its sights on the pants trend du jour: low-rise jeans. Yesterday, the Dawson's Creek alum was spotted out and about in New York City running errands while wearing an effortlessly stylish look. Her breezy, late-summer ensemble consisted of a blush pink spaghetti-strap cami tucked into a pair of baggy low-rise jeans in a light wash.

""It made me appreciate silhouettes and cuts and color in a way I thought I had, but when you put it on camera, when you are trying to tell a story, you can see how clothing can do a lot of the work for you.""Of her personal wardrobe, she added, ""I love my T-shirts, and I love my vintage T-shirts.

All the Spring 2022 Makeup Trends We Can't Wait to Wear,"Worn by celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, Kendall Jenner, Tracee Ellis Ross, Millie Bobby Brown, and more, the '90s- and Y2K-inspired braided tendril trend has only increased in popularity since its reemergence during the 2022 festival season. ""The tendril trend has always been an easy way to add a little 'razzle-dazzle' to any updo,"" Erinn Courtney, a natural hair expert at StyleSeat and celebrity stylist, tells BAZAAR.com. Typically crafted as a set of smaller, face-framing braids, braided tendrils are an easy way to elevate a go-to bun or ponytail. You can also quickly enhance a salon-quality blowout or beachy waves by adding a second pair of braids near the ears for a summery, carefree hair look.View full post on InstagramView full post on InstagramWhen it comes to the styling essentials needed for a braided tendril updo versus wearing your hair completely down, professionals say there isn't much difference in the products and tools to keep in your arsenal.

""For updos in particular, I love using a little barber's brush to smooth hair into a cute bun or pony,"" she adds. ""I also recommend applying gel around the perimeter of the hair, brushing it upwards, then securing it with a hair tie.

Duchess Meghan Trends Online After Daily Mail Publisher Finally Acknowledges Court Defeat,"Ahead of the premiere of her much-awaited film Blonde, in which she portrays Marilyn Monroe, Ana de Armas is diving into a world Monroe knew quite a lot about: diamonds.The film and fashion icon famously sang ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" in the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and was known for her elegant style and love of high jewelry (remember when she wore the spectacular yellow diamond necklace dubbed The Moon of Baroda?). At the time, however, the diamond industry was seen as untouchable and unreachable for both ordinary buyers and small jewelry designers, and only big names, such as De Beers and Tiffany & Co., got the business and the notoriety. At the same time, conflict diamonds and diamond smuggling became real problems.Now, the Natural Diamond Council, along with brand ambassador de Armas, is looking to change that by backing young designers from around the world and educating buyers on the current state of the industry, which is moving toward a more sustainable and inclusive future.More From Harper's BAZAAR""I started working with the NDC in 2020, and I think it was a process for me of learning,"" de Armas tells BAZAAR.com at the NDC's launch event on June 14 at the Beekman Hotel penthouse in New York City, adding that she got to see how women in Botswana ran diamond mines and handled tractors, and essentially got to know the community behind the precious stones.    Vincenzo DiminoOn Tuesday, the NDC debuted the collections of the second class of artists from its Emerging Designers Diamond Initiative, which launched in January 2021 with $1 million of diamond credit dedicated to supporting emerging BIPOC jewelry designers, in partnership with Lorraine Schwartz.Per the NDC, ""The diamond industry is historically a generational and handshake industry where emerging designers without prior connections often experience barriers to entry. The program sets to level the playing field by providing direct, career-lasting relationships with diamantaires by underwriting $1 million in diamond credit in the designers’ own names. Industry education and resources, mentor pairings, and financial support for production and CAD designs are NDC’s efforts to help create a more equitable future.""Vincenzo DiminoDe Armas, wearing a brilliant ring and necklace from Dorian Webb and a ring from Heart the Stones by Halle Millien, says it's powerful the way in which the NDC is supporting—and financially backing—artists in the community who need the space to simply do what they're good at.""As a minority myself, I remember the days when I just wanted the chance to be in the room. I wanted to just be there. Give me the opportunity and I'll show you what I can offer,"" de Armas says. ""The fact that they're mentoring and supporting and opening the doors to relationships and careers and resources for these guys and giving them the credit is incredible.""The Cuban actress is no stranger to red-carpet glamour, and she has been dripped in diamonds for roles several times over the course of her film career, but she says the passion and originality of the up-and-coming jewelry designers' diamond pieces prove there are still ways to break boundaries in the diamond world.""It's the new generations who are going to bring a new take on jewelry. We don't have to keep wearing or interpreting jewelry in the same way,"" she says.Vincenzo DiminoJewelry, and diamonds in particular, the actress agrees, can be incredibly personal. They can be much more than just beautiful, high-priced pieces we like to look at. A jewelry collection can be passed down for generations, it can carry different meanings and morph and be modernized through the years—take Duchess Kate's inherited jewelry from Princess Diana, for example.De Armas says there is one piece she bought herself that she cherishes above all others: an antique ring that reminds her of her grandmother.""I had a ring from my grandma that I'm pretty sure was not a diamond, but it was this dark red stone with little things around it, and I lost it at the airport and I was so, so, so, so sad,"" she recalls in a conversation with BAZAAR. ""And years went by, and then I was shooting a movie and we were shooting on the street and I bumped into an antique store and I found the version of that ring—same color, but this time real diamonds—and I had to get it. It wasn't my grandma's ring, but it just reminds me of her. I have it here, actually, because I always wear it."" Maybe not as meaningful but equally dazzling were the jewels de Armas got to wear while filming the 2021 James Bond film No Time to Die with Daniel Craig.""That was beautiful—such an incredible touch for the character.

The Ula Nifo necklace was worn by Samoan chiefs and their children in ancient times, and signified wealth and status, designer Constance Polamalu explains.""It's just so different,"" de Armas says.Grant Mobley, a diamond and fine jewelry expert at the NDC, tells BAZAAR how rare and exciting it is to see a high-jewelry piece so influenced by a designer's underrepresented culture, and yet so wearable today.""If you think back to these incredible Samoan jewelry designs with the amazing necklace collars from well over 100 years ago, she's turning that into something that makes sense for the modern day, and she's also doing that with fine jewelry materials: gold, diamonds,"" he says. ""It's something that might've been worn hundreds of years ago by her ancestors, but she's making it something that she would wear and that you would see on the red carpet.""The collections of the latest EDDI class of designers—Casey Perez, Corey Anthony Jones, Lana Ogilvie (Sabre Jewelry), Mckenzie Liautaud, Halle Millien (Heart the Stones), and Ruben Manuel—will launch this Friday, June 17, on 1stDibs.

16 Pieces of Jewelry That Make Excellent Gifts,"Storing your jewelry can be an afterthought to wearing your jewelry. But your pendants and cocktail rings are still on display to you, in your home, when you're not wearing them. Now, there's a collaboration to replace a dresser-top tangle of gold and silver with something more organized and refined.Mejuri enlisted Claude Home founder Maggie Holladay to design two ceramic vessels for displaying and storing your bracelets, earrings, and rings. Nested together or placed separately, the two asymmetric marble containers are as much miniature sculptures as they are dishes for your everyday stack. They also have shades of the function-meets-art-forms seen in Claude Home's signature vases and vessels. MejuriThe collaboration is technically Mejuri's first foray into home goods. But Mejuri has dabbled outside of bijoux in the past, racking up waiting lists of 5,000-plus people for its jewelry boxes and travel sets.

The 6 Biggest Hat Trends of The Season,"Lately I wonder if we’re living through a mass psychosis expressing itself through trend reporting. If it felt a year ago like anything goes—that the restrictions and trauma of the pandemic highlighted fashion and self-expression as a new outlet for freedom—increasingly it seems that there are a thousand trends happening at once. In just the past month, I have read stories about a new twist on the girlboss trend called “that girl,” a trend in which women really enjoy themselves, and a trend in which women enjoy themselves a little, plus “dinocore,” “clowncore,” and “twee.” On TikTok, trend forecasting has become the new influencer hustle, almost a trend itself; creators who can string together photographic evidence with a pithy and compelling monologue are performing a kind of competitive prophecy. And the platform’s algorithm seems to favor this sort of information sharing: the more ridiculous the prediction, the more traction it gains, and the more predictions we are fed. In the meantime, fast fashion brands like Shein have sped production to such a pace that they can both predict and reflect these trends, making them feel all the more real while we ping pong through “feels” and “vibes” with no aesthetic compass. Even runway fashion, which is supposed to move at a slower, biannual speed, has joined this rat race, as designers pack their shows with potential viral moments and styles that are replicable by anyone with a little ingenuity and a pair of scissors. The tempo of fashion makes everything feel quick, carefree, and, sometimes, unfortunately, even careless. Mostly it seems that people are doing things humans have done for most of the past century—relaxing, working hard, having martinis, not having martinis—but now we cannot resist the urge to package them into something that feels more meaningful than mere consumer choices.Jerry Lorenzo, the 44-year-old designer behind the brand Fear of God, is a man who has started many trends himself (real trends, that is). When he began his brand almost a decade ago, it was a luxury cornerstone of the hypebeast movement, which often encourages a cut-throat, product-driven style of consumerism. Lorenzo worked on an early season of Yeezy alongside then-Vetements designer Demna, and, after making T-shirts for Justin Bieber’s “Purpose” tour, helped turn merch into meaningful clothes. He was a close friend of and collaborator with the late Virgil Abloh, whose brand Off-White propelled streetwear to the forefront of fashion, and his sneakers and sweatpants remain staples in hip corridors of Los Angeles and New York. But lately, Lorenzo has been on a different kind of fashion journey. In early 2020 he collaborated with Ermenegildo Zegna’s Alessandro Sartori for a collection that shifted menswear’s inner circle’s attitude around suiting, making it feel less performative and more like a staple. And now his collections, which arrive on his own time rather than seasonally, serve a slower, even higher purpose. Today, he is releasing a new collection, his first in nearly two years. As he worked on it, he said in a video interview late last week, he asked himself of every garment, “Is this timeless?”“I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now,” he said. “And I want to provide a safe space for someone that wants to step outside of that, but can still step into that conversation with everyone else that’s of ‘the now’ and feel of ‘the now,’ but not have to be so on trend.” Instead, what he wants his clothing to do is help his customers “feel the confidence. I want them to feel sophisticated, but I want them to feel the freedom to be themselves and know that it’s not the trend that validates you. It’s the individual that you are.” Lorenzo calls this collection Eternal. And while the clothing is a natural progression of the easy elegance of the collections he dropped in late summer and fall of 2020, it seems quite radical, to me, to proclaim you want to defy the trend cycle and try to make something that has lasting value. It seems so obvious, to try to float above it all, and yet the intoxicating quest for relevance has made it a rare impulse. Lorenzo is almost dipping into the realm of slow fashion—of designers with far less recognizable names who rarely stage fashion shows, like the 19th-century inspired work of Paul Harnden, the simple French cottons of Casey Casey, or the heady beauty of Elena Dawson. They make clothing that is intentionally hard to find and difficult to make. Lorenzo hasn’t gone that far, of course, and he has in his corner the fact that his clothing is meant to make you feel as comfortable in a suit as you are in your favorite sweatshirt. That means it has the potential to transcend the cognoscenti customer of slow fashion brands, or perhaps convert recovering hypebeasts into cognoscenti. He is designing with incredible thoughtfulness, even integrity–almost like a novel. “I approach it like a book or a music album,” said Lorenzo of putting together collections. “I don't really approach it in terms of seasons and seasonality. I approach it like, Hey, do I have something to say? Do I have the resources to say what I wanna say in the best way?” He remains independently owned–he also has a partnership with Adidas, where he serves as the head of strategy for their basketball category—and his resources are just catching up to his point of view, as he put it. He’s been able to move 80% of his production to Italy, for example. “And so hopefully each time we have something to say, it’s better than the last thing we said.” Lorenzo, of course, isn’t the only designer to prize continual improvement over novelty. The Row’s Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen come to mind, and Lorenzo, like The Row and other influential American aesthetes, is particularly drawn, lately, to the 1980s and ’90s designs of Giorgio Armani. His cascades of beige in flowing, almost spiritually understated cuts wrote a new script for minimalism. If Prada was cerebral, edgy, and obscure, and Calvin Klein was sexy, Armani was, just as Lorenzo said, a man of confidence, whose clothing blessed its wearers with a feeling of monastic chic weightlessness. “I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now.”In Eternal, the cuts are generous without swamping their wearer in fabric; the tones are bones, milky beiges, and greyish whites; and nearly all the pants blur the line between a structured trouser and a cozy sweatpant. You can see how a person dressed in these clothes might calm a room of investors or subtly change the energy in a coffee shop line. “I am in fashion, and I do love to present myself a certain way,” Lorenzo mused. “But that’s always been something that is understated. It’s always been something that isn’t loud and doesn’t call for attention. As quiet as I want to be in a room, I also want to be competent, you know?” Like Armani—and again, like The Row—Lorenzo is thinking about how his clothing might provide solutions, not only to the holes in your wardrobe but to your own questions about your sense of self. How do you wear a suit, which has different proportions and fabrics than a hoodie or track pants, and still feel like yourself? “That’s what I’m always chasing, you know? How can I be always sophisticated in the way that I present myself, but honest, and relaxed and comfortable?” Lorenzo’s evolution as a designer over the past decade, from a Los Angeles DJ to a new hero in intentional clothing creation, has been one of fashion’s most interesting. By staying independent, he’s allowed himself the time to grow and explore that investors or big luxury house appointments rarely afford. Too often, a designer’s references are too readily apparent, too surface—Ralph Lauren’s Polo line, or Annie Leibowitz’s images for The Gap, or the wackadoo spirit of 1980s couture that seems to have captured the imagination of many young womenswear designers in New York. In fact, prior to his dalliance with Zegna, Lorenzo spoke about wanting to build a brand like Lauren’s. But Lorenzo has a new modesty about him, and his clothing feels intimate in a way that Lauren’s, which is much more like a worshipful encyclopedia of American style, simply cannot. We talked about how opting out of trendiness can be quite boring—depending on how many viscose trouser-wearing influencers you follow on Instagram, you might say it’s even something of a trend itself—and how he’s tweaked his pieces, and played with fabrics, to give his pieces some heart and some personality. Changing the shoulder on a jacket from a past collection to make it feel less 1980s, for example. The result is that these are real clothes, for someone who is not trying to create a look for a moment in time, but who believes fashion can improve your life in small but significant ways.Open GalleryRachel TashjianRachel Tashjian is the Fashion News Director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.

5 Micro Trends You'll Want to Wear STAT,"No one does glamour quite like Anya Taylor-Joy. So, to no one's surprise, The Queen's Gambit star looked incredible at the 73rd annual Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles last night.

Tiffany and Co. Tiffany and Co.Taylor-Joy's gown for the evening was embellished with two of the luxury jeweler's Elsa Peretti Diamonds by the Yard platinum necklaces elegantly draped down the actress's back— a mesmerizing look that was inspired by classic movie stars from Old Hollywood's past.

Tiffany and Co.Tiffany and Co.The actress's breathtaking beauty look for the night was equally dramatic, with Taylor Joy opting for a matte complexion, flushed cheeks, neutral eye shadow, wispy lashes, and vibrant red lips. She wore her hair in a vintage-inspired, delicately styled bouffant, but added a modern, kitschy touch with a bright-yellow manicure as well.

Shop Y2K-Inspired Jewelry Pieces That Are More Than Just Nostalgic,"MoAna Luu has spent her professional life building brands, from designing boutique hotels to serving as chief content and creative officer at Essence. But after contracting Covid-19 in March 2020, Luu decided to refocus on a new brand-building effort—one that’s entirely her own. That project is ManLuu, a line of luxury jewelry paying homage to Luu’s Creole heritage—a blend of African, Indian, French, and Caribbean traditions—and Martinique’s long tradition of jewelry-making. ManLuu arrives today at Nordstrom for its official, 21-item debut following a soft online launch this summer. ManLuu is composed of gender neutral earrings, bracelets, and rings in 18k gold vermeil and sterling silver. Nods to Creole jewelry tradition emerge through ManLuu’s use of exaggerated geometric shapes and signature woven patterns (an octagonal hoop with webbed inlays here, a chunky beaded bracelet there). ""The craftsmanship is something that is so delicate, when you see it you know you have a precious piece already,"" Luu says.More From Harper's BAZAARSome of the designer's earliest introductions to Creole craftsmanship came from her grandparents’ jewelry store in Fort-de-France, Martinique, Luu tells BAZAAR.com. But ManLuu’s devotion to quality is inspired by even earlier references, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. At that time, Black people could not become property owners, so they invested in gold jewelry heirlooms to pass down among generations. Luu says that ManLuu shares the power of this story, one that many people may not know, through each piece.MoAna Luu at the ManLuu atelier in New York City.ManLuuManLuu’s interpretation of heirloom jewelry had resonated long before this week’s Nordstrom launch. Gwyneth Paltrow, Mary J. Blige, and Maye Musk are a few of its early fans. Cardi B. even wore ManLuu bangles to announce her second pregnancy earlier this year—a special stamp of approval for the brand, Luu tells us. Joining forces with a large retailer like Nordstrom is, in some ways, even more significant than those celebrity endorsements. ""As a Black female designer and founder, I believe it's important that heritage brands welcome new creators and support them taking their place in the luxury market,"" Luu explains. ""This is a big step, not just for me, but for all of us.""While ManLuu's approach to luxury references centuries-old jewelry traditions, its use of eco-friendly materials is thoroughly 2021. Many pieces are crafted with recycled metals; later on, ManLuu will also incorporate lab-grown diamonds. Luu couldn't imagine starting a new label without incorporating conscious design techniques: “Sustainability is something that, today, is mandatory in any business."" By balancing meaningful history with modern design, ManLuu is an alternative to the throwaway jewelry sold, well, nearly everywhere. “Fast fashion was nice,” Luu says, “but now it’s time for pieces you want to keep.” And one day, pass down.Shop Manluu at NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$770 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Classic Beaded Necklace$2,650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Open Ring$600 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Cuff Bracelet$2,800 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$370 at NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$900 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Ear Jackets$1,000 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$570 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Embossed Ring$650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Long Beaded Necklace$4,200 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$470 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$1,100 at NordstromCredit: NordstromHalie LeSavageHalie LeSavage is the fashion commerce editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, where she covers everything from emerging designers to viral products to must-shop sales events.

Get a Closer Look at Anya Taylor-Joy's Tiffany & Co. Jewelry for the 2021 Emmy Awards,"No one can take a time-out from the Y2K fashion revival. Not even our iPhones. Like bucket hats and platform flip flops before them, phone straps of the early aughts variety are having a renaissance. Think of these attachable lanyards like the camp jewelry trend, but for your phone. The plainest phone straps start with rainbow-colored resin beads and get kitschier from there. Entire indie brands are dedicated to beaded phone straps, with String Ting, GriGri, and Hang On credited in mirror selfies across Instagram. Established accessories players are catching on, with versions appearing at Roxanne Assoulin and Lele Sadoughi. View full post on InstagramAlex Bass, founder at phone strap seller Hang On, says Y2K nostalgia is a big part of her brand. Hang On’s aesthetic harkens back to the days when cell phones were a novelty and personalizing them was a compulsion—the more glitter, the better. In Bass’s case, she stuck “stickers and rhinestones on every square centimeter of the phone, à la Carrie Bradshaw.”More From Harper's BAZAARBut there’s more to the phone strap trend than 2000 calling to give our lucky charms back,  String Ting founder Rachel Steed-Middleton tells BAZAAR.com. “The ‘smartphone-is-my-life’ way of being is more current and of the times, so this is really a very new and modern-day category of accessorizing,” she says.

The 40 Most Iconic Jewelry Movie Moments of All Time,"Katie Kova is petite, quietly spoken, and very chic (think simple, understated style that conveys a quiet sort of elegance). Her newly launched fine jewelry label, Kova, follows in much the same vein. ""My jewelry is 100% wearable, stackable, mixable, and day-to-night viable,"" she says. ""I wear it with a T-shirt and flats and with a cocktail dress and stilettos.""Inspired by the 20th-century Russian art movement Suprematism (invented by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich, it was one of the earliest and most radical developments in abstract art), Kova's pieces possess the same sort of graphic, linear construction and minimalist feel as her favorite artworks. An ear cuff features circles and zig zag lines embedded with dozens of black and white pave diamonds, while a pair of triangular earrings have slight differences in each side. ""At Kova we see jewelry as a form of wearable creation,"" she says. ""We begin with analysis, researching shapes, lines, concepts, references, textures, inspirations, fits, and even variable degrees of shine—that´s how nerdy we can be. It´s all about the conceptual and creative challenges of launching a line that's cohesive, unique, and by all means; beautiful."" Sally GriffithsFor the Moscow-born, London-based designer, jewelry wasn't her first calling. Rather, she studied business before leaping into the world of accessories. ""I always knew that I´d start my own project and that it would be a creative one. Even when I was studying business I was interested in architecture and design,"" she explains. ""Jewelry is my true passion. The minute my grandfather gave me my first piece of jewelry when I was 14, I became an ad hoc jewelry researcher. Kova is the result of that informal education and my very formal business studies."" And while her homeland provides much of the inspiration, Kova's London base also delivers plenty of influences. ""Russia gave me a vast cultural legacy: The unparalleled graphic influence of artists Rodchenko, Malevich, and Kandinsky—to name just three. London on the other hand stimulated my creativity as an individual. It´s a city of creativity, talent, and brains that has made my vision so much more versatile.""More From Harper's BAZAARHer sculptural, minimalist pieces are also a step away from traditional fine jewelry, especially those that she grew up around. ""In Russia, fine jewelry is passed from generation to generation so it´s highly valued. Collecting fine jewelry has been a tradition in my family for generations. My favorite piece is the Tiffany & Co. bracelet that my grandfather gave me when I was 14. I still wear it all the time. It's not about trends, it´s about design integrity and the best stones."" In a rapidly changing accessories market, Kova's pieces personify a new approach to fine jewelry—unlike traditional fine jewels there's no need to keep them locked in a vault or only worn on special occasions. ""Women today understand fine jewelry as a wearable accessory rather than just an investment,"" agrees Kova. Her own personal approach to fashion and style is indicative of the change. ""I am not a girly girl but I´m not masculine either. I appreciate femininity but not in its literal instance. You won´t see me in ruffles and bows, you'll see me in pieces that are understated and elegant. I love wearing clothes that empower you, that give you confidence.""Read more from Tara from PROFYLES.com."

"13 Fall 2022 Trends Worth Shopping, According to Fashion Insiders","Media Platforms Design TeamWith Earth Day coming up on Friday, the model and green activist chatted with us about her latest collaboration with Guy Bedarida of John Hardy. (Below left, one of the lovely recycled sterling-silver pieces.)How did the collaboration with Guy Bedarida come about? Very organically — Guy and I were introduced a few years ago and connected right away. Guy invited me to Bali — where he lives and the John Hardy workshop is located — to meet with him, the local artisans and see the compound. I was so inspired by the island's beauty and the local people that Guy and I began discussing how we could collaborate on a jewelry collection that would represent my visit. Bamboo is a ubiquitous plant in Bali so it was important for us to incorporate it into our designs and we did, you can see the Hijau (meaning ""green"" in Balinese) collection showcases the look of sliced bamboo. This year we are proud to launch Hijau Dua, our second collaboration.What were some of the biggest challenges and surprises that came up in the process?More From Harper's BAZAARDesigning the jewelry was exciting and challenging all at once.  One can never know how meticulous the design process is until they witness it firsthand.  First comes the sketch, then the mold is created and then the piece is cast; in the case of Hijau Dua in recycled sterling silver or 18K gold.  I was so impressed by the attention to detail Guy and his artisans pay to each and every piece of handcrafted jewelry.As someone who's previously been on the other side of the coin, what was it like designing pieces as opposed to modeling them?While I do love my work, I've always felt quite comfortable on the ""other side.""  I feel a great sense of accomplishment when I've worked hard to create something and see it come to life.What was your favorite aspect of your trip to Bali?The Balinese people are truly amazing.  They have such a commitment to nature and their surroundings.  It really blew me away to see how they take such pride in their work and utilizing everything the earth provides.We know you've been an eco-activist for some time. What do you hope will result from this collaboration, in terms of raising awareness about the environment?Yes, I have been committed to this for several years now and I think the best thing we can do to create true awareness is to educate. I even started my own foundation, Collage, a non-profit that tackles environmental and social issues through various partnerships and events. My collaboration with John Hardy is meant to inspire people everywhere to see that each and every one of us can make a difference in our own way.  For this collection, we are donating a portion of sales to John Hardy's ""Wear Bamboo, Plant Bamboo"" program, which plants a number of bamboo seedlings for every piece of jewelry sold.This content is imported from youTube.

The 19 Best Ballet Flats That Transcend Shoe Trends,"Usually, when Phoebe Bridgers talks about the moon, she's singing to a group of crying fans (I am, admittedly, one of them) who are mouthing the words to her ""Moon Song."" But last week, she could be found talking about astronomy in a not-heart-wrenching context—while wearing Chanel jewelry inspired by the stars. Standing underneath a crescent moon on a stage in Los Angeles, she introduced the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who were performing for Chanel’s guests at a dinner celebrating the launch of the 1932 jewelry collection, which is the second one ever released by the brand. The crowd cheered, but the 18-karat Coco Crush earrings and bracelet adorning Bridgers’s earlobes and wrist were beautiful enough that they could have elicited tears (of jealousy). Phoebe Bridgers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinIt has been 90 years since Gabrielle Chanel designed Bijoux de Diamants, the first high jewelry collection in history. It was created three years after Black Thursday pushed the world into the Great Depression, and Chanel was determined to create something that could shine through the turmoil. The 50-piece collection was made of white and yellow diamonds set in platinum and yellow gold, with 22 pieces inspired by specific constellations. “Nothing could be better for forgetting the crisis than feasting one’s eyes on beautiful new things,” she said of the collection. And so it feels fitting that in 2022, nearly three years after the entire world stood still for the pandemic, the fashion house she built would respond to our somber times with something just as sumptuous.More From Harper's BAZAARThe Yeah Yeah Yeahs performing at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinLike the original Bijoux de Diamants collection, the design of 1932 is harmonized around three symbols: the comet, the moon, and the sun. Chanel muses like Marion Cotillard, Lori Harvey, Greta Lee, and Whitney Peak were in attendance at the West Hollywood celebration, and, like Bridgers, were also layered in pieces from the 1932 collection named after the cosmos. Maggie Rogers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection. Pat MartinSinger Maggie Rogers, who also recently graduated from Harvard’s Divinity School, wore five rings from the collection but said the shooting star Comète ear cuff in 18-karat gold was her favorite. On the Chanel black carpet, Rogers mentioned how she felt a kinship with Gabrielle over her affinity for outer space: “[The cosmos] is something that has always resonated with me and is very apparent and present in my musical work.” Gossip Girl’s Whitney Peak said the collection made her feel like a “superstar” before joking, “I feel like I shouldn’t be wearing it. I don’t know how they let me get away with this!” and then grasping the 1932 Comète Couture necklace in 18-karat gold and diamonds around her neck. Whitney Peak at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinWhile there are 77 pieces in the collection, its signature piece is the Allure Céleste necklace, with round-cut diamonds, an oval sapphire of deep blue, and a weight of 55.5 carats. What makes it extraordinary is its ability to transform: The halos detach to become brooches, and the central row of diamonds becomes a bracelet, converting the necklace into a shorter version. Thirteen other pieces from the 1932 collection also have the ability to transform in a similar manner, allowing the wearer to make new diamond constellations around their wrists and necks.Guests dining at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinMany of the pieces were made without clasps, something Gabrielle Chanel openly disliked. “I detest clasps! I’ve done away with clasps! Yet my jewelry is transformable,” she said in an interview in 1932 after the “Bijoux de Diamants” exhibition. She strived to design pieces that offered flexibility to busy women with full lives, and that didn’t impede their freedom. And as the jewelry-spangled guests left their cares behind to dance under a canopy of baby’s breath, it was evident that the new 1932 collection stays true to her vision.Tara GonzalezTara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.

Katie Holmes Is Fully Embracing Fall's Latest Pants Trend,"Prada has never done things by the book. The brand has been creating the world's most desirable fashion pieces since their start over one hundred years ago, going from making humble leather goods to being one of the biggest privately owned brands in the world. Now, the brand is expanding on their aesthetic universe with a daring introduction into fine jewelry. The inaugural collection, titled ETERNAL GOLD, marks both a commitment to beauty and to sustainable, circular fashion.Maya Hawke for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsAs Prada's first-ever fine jewelry offering, ETERNAL GOLD is a first in many aspects. It's also the world's first fine jewelry collection made entirely with recycled gold, collected using the industry's most rigorous standards set by the Responsible Jewelry Council. Prada is also the first company to expand on diamond traceability, making every single carat count traceable down to its origins. The complete transparency of every material used in their jewelry, from sourcing to cutting to setting, is a radical step in the direction of honest production for an otherwise murky process. Somi Jeon for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsThe jewelry is a reflection of Prada's impact on the industry and a continuation of their efforts to creating beautiful objects that stands the test of time, as all fine jewelry should. ETERNAL GOLD is rife with Pradaisms, with the instantly recognizable Prada triangle rendered as sleek earrings and pendants, but also imbued in clasp closures, and more subtly, in chain links and as the head and tail of the snake bracelet.  The snake bracelet itself may at first recall other serpent bracelets, but finds its own voice with the sneaky Prada triangle and smooth, unvarnished gold. Heart pendants take on an edgy effect with the triangle chainlink it sits on.More From Harper's BAZAARCourtesyCourtesyPrada chose three voices of our time to don this foundational collection, representing where Prada is now and where it can go. Amanda Gorman, award-winning poet and activist, Maya Hawke, singer/songwriter, actress, and model, and Somi Jeon, musician, become one with the gold, immortalized in gold negative renderings by David Sims. The jewelry and its campaign represent the future of a wholly responsible planet that isn't sacrificing purity and beauty at its demise.

15 Trends from the 1960s That Are Still Everywhere in Fashion,"Is any woman as synonymous with another creature as Mariah Carey is with a butterfly?This week, the singer celebrated the 30th anniversary of the release of her groundbreaking album Butterfly, and now she celebrates the arrival of her collaboration with the jeweler Chopard, which launches in stores and online today, September 16. The pieces, a mix of butterflies rendered in diamonds on rings, bracelets, earrings, and a breathtaking statement necklace, commemorate Carey’s  longtime affinity for the creature who helped her conceptualize her life as an independent artist at the top of a male-dominated music industry. She describes the process of seeing and wearing the pieces, while simultaneously celebrating “my favorite album that I’ve done,” as an emotional experience. “It’s a major moment, and it’s a full circle moment,” she says. Here she tells us about conceptualizing the collection, her daily jewelry wardrobe, and how she will wear the pieces.Harper’s Bazaar: I want to start by talking about this incredible butterfly necklace. Mariah Carey: Oh my gosh.HB: The butterfly, of course, is this incredibly significant symbol of transformation for you. But seeing the butterfly rendered in diamonds reminded me of how dazzling they are. They’re the most beautiful living creatures. And I wondered if you learned anything about the butterfly, seeing it rendered in diamonds. The enduring symbol of the butterfly—I mean, we can go on and on about different people's interpretations and feelings. My own personal feelings are so very specific to my album Butterfly and that period of my life, which we are celebrating the anniversary of this year, [coincidentally] at the same time that this is all happening, right? Because we've been working on this [with Chopard] for two years together, and it happened by accident [that] we’re re-releasing the Butterfly album, which is my favorite album that I’ve done.And yes, I have a very specific relationship with the butterfly and just the whole metamorphosis of it. The way that I had to come through a very difficult time in my life and, you know, like they say, you’ve gotta go through something to get something. I had to get to that place where I felt empowered enough to metaphorically fly and be free from that place where I was. I started out in this industry as such a young girl in a really difficult world, dominated by men. I wrote this song as I was leaving this mansion that I had paid for half of, and [where] I had sort of created my own little prison, not really deliberately, but it ended up feeling that way. And I was leaving and I wrote the lyrics and the melody to [the song “Butterfly”]: Spread your wings and prepare to fly / for you have become a butterfly. And so that’s always stuck with me. I’ve made many albums since then, but it’s just very specific to me. So to see this magnificent butterfly necklace, and the ring—I mean, it was so much to even be able to say, I collaborated on this. To be able to admire the craft—I don’t want to say “craftsmanship.” Please give me another word.HB: The creation, the artistry?The artistry! That’s what it is. Just to be able to collaborate with Chopard and doing this collection is a humongous honor. I’m just here, ready to put some diamonds on and hang out. Whatever! Courtesy of Chopard.HB: What is your daily jewelry wardrobe? Are we wearing the butterfly ring every day and the necklace for special occasions? Or is there a different routine here?I am not really one for routines of any sort. I’m not a dancer. I don’t really like to follow rules. So I would wear any piece on any occasion. But right now i’m wearing a bracelet that my daughter made for me that says “Lamily” on it, which is an homage to my fans made of little beads and elastic, with some diamond bracelets. I would wear any piece from the collection in a casual moment, or more specifically the Happy Butterfly collection, which I love so much. I think they’re gonna look gorgeous stacked with even just a T-shirt and jeans, leggings, a simple dress. There’s just really great pieces that are attainable, as well as those gorgeous—I don’t find them over the top, some might say they are; they’re major—pieces that I live for.They are really major. And they feel so you. I can see you wearing this incredible butterfly necklace with a T-shirt, or these enormous leaf earrings.I would do that! I’m so ready to wear those. When Caroline [Scheufele, the president of Chopard] was evolving and creating them, she was explaining them to me and I knew exactly what she meant, but when I saw them, I was losing it. I mean, they’re just sick. It’s beyond. They’re so good. [Laughs.]Sounds like you and Caroline had good chemistry.I feel like Caroline probably has incredible chemistry with anyone cuz she’s so fun and carefree. I love that about her. She’s also an artist and a businesswoman, and to work with her to make this collection together, [it feels] even more extra special because it was my idea and I was able to watch it happen.Courtesy of Chopard.Would you say it’s true that diamonds are a girl’s best friend?Well, considering the people I know, for sure. Maybe the exception of one or two. You know, at the end of the day, they’re not going to steer you wrong! Do you feel like jewelry plays an important part in your life spiritually? It can be armor, but it also reflects the essential feminine aspects of who you are.That’s interesting. I’ve never thought of it that way. There were little things, little pieces that I’ve had throughout my life, where they did have their own—I wouldn’t say spiritual, but they had a sort of special significance to me where I would keep them on no matter what. Swimming, whatever I was doing, I would keep them on. Because they were that special to me. And at one point I lost a piece of jewelry that I loved so much, and it wasn’t even that it was a major thing. It just meant something to me. But with this collection, everything means so much to me that I’m just excited to share it with the world.

Fall 2022's 5 Best Jewelry Trends Are Unexpected and Bold,"Katie Holmes's classic street style has set its sights on the pants trend du jour: low-rise jeans. Yesterday, the Dawson's Creek alum was spotted out and about in New York City running errands while wearing an effortlessly stylish look. Her breezy, late-summer ensemble consisted of a blush pink spaghetti-strap cami tucked into a pair of baggy low-rise jeans in a light wash. She continued the minimalist approach with the rest of her outfit, wearing olive green flip-flops and carrying a maroon shoulder bag from A.P.C., eschewing jewelry entirely.BACKGRIDBaggy pants have made cameos in Holmes's street style before.Earlier this month, she made a cozy appearance in the city, accompanied by boyfriend Bobby Wooten III, while wearing an oversized slouchy pair of black trousers.

""It made me appreciate silhouettes and cuts and color in a way I thought I had, but when you put it on camera, when you are trying to tell a story, you can see how clothing can do a lot of the work for you.""Of her personal wardrobe, she added, ""I love my T-shirts, and I love my vintage T-shirts.

12 Trends that Define 2022 So Far,"Kendall Jenner's latest off-duty look goes back to the basics.Earlier this week, the reality TV star and model stepped out wearing an iteration of one of her classic summer uniforms. The ensemble was composed of sensible high-waisted straight-leg trousers in white and a salmon-colored cropped cardigan from Miaou. Jenner styled the look with this season's most covetable shoe option: the kitten heel. Her take on the trend involved an ivory pair resembling ballet flats and featuring the signature mini heels.For accessories, Jenner went subtle, opting for a black leather shoulder bag from The Row, skinny rectangular sunglasses, and a black belt.BACKGRIDSo far, the 818 founder's summer has been full of simple yet sophisticated looks like this one.Back in June, for instance, she put her own spin on the coastal grandmother trend by sporting a pair of powder-yellow shorts from Aritzia with a super-cropped gray tank top, plus a dusty-blue button-up from Almina Concept and a spacious black tote bag. In another outing, the model looked cool and casual in a black cami, a denim midi skirt from The Row, and a pair of black loafers, while flashing a bright orange wallet from Hermès.Jenner previously talked to BAZAAR.com about 818, her tequila brand.""It's been amazing to see how much 818 has accomplished in just over a year,"" she said in June. ""As we enter year two, I see 818 continuing to grow, engaging with our customers in new and interesting ways, and staying committed to our sustainability mission. I want us to be known for our delicious-tasting tequila and also for how we continue to give back to local communities.""Chelsey SanchezDigital Associate EditorAs an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.

Ana de Armas Supports BIPOC Jewelry Designers Through Natural Diamond Council Partnership,"Ahead of the premiere of her much-awaited film Blonde, in which she portrays Marilyn Monroe, Ana de Armas is diving into a world Monroe knew quite a lot about: diamonds.The film and fashion icon famously sang ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" in the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and was known for her elegant style and love of high jewelry (remember when she wore the spectacular yellow diamond necklace dubbed The Moon of Baroda?). At the time, however, the diamond industry was seen as untouchable and unreachable for both ordinary buyers and small jewelry designers, and only big names, such as De Beers and Tiffany & Co., got the business and the notoriety. At the same time, conflict diamonds and diamond smuggling became real problems.Now, the Natural Diamond Council, along with brand ambassador de Armas, is looking to change that by backing young designers from around the world and educating buyers on the current state of the industry, which is moving toward a more sustainable and inclusive future.More From Harper's BAZAAR""I started working with the NDC in 2020, and I think it was a process for me of learning,"" de Armas tells BAZAAR.com at the NDC's launch event on June 14 at the Beekman Hotel penthouse in New York City, adding that she got to see how women in Botswana ran diamond mines and handled tractors, and essentially got to know the community behind the precious stones.    Vincenzo DiminoOn Tuesday, the NDC debuted the collections of the second class of artists from its Emerging Designers Diamond Initiative, which launched in January 2021 with $1 million of diamond credit dedicated to supporting emerging BIPOC jewelry designers, in partnership with Lorraine Schwartz.Per the NDC, ""The diamond industry is historically a generational and handshake industry where emerging designers without prior connections often experience barriers to entry. The program sets to level the playing field by providing direct, career-lasting relationships with diamantaires by underwriting $1 million in diamond credit in the designers’ own names. Industry education and resources, mentor pairings, and financial support for production and CAD designs are NDC’s efforts to help create a more equitable future.""Vincenzo DiminoDe Armas, wearing a brilliant ring and necklace from Dorian Webb and a ring from Heart the Stones by Halle Millien, says it's powerful the way in which the NDC is supporting—and financially backing—artists in the community who need the space to simply do what they're good at.""As a minority myself, I remember the days when I just wanted the chance to be in the room. I wanted to just be there. Give me the opportunity and I'll show you what I can offer,"" de Armas says. ""The fact that they're mentoring and supporting and opening the doors to relationships and careers and resources for these guys and giving them the credit is incredible.""The Cuban actress is no stranger to red-carpet glamour, and she has been dripped in diamonds for roles several times over the course of her film career, but she says the passion and originality of the up-and-coming jewelry designers' diamond pieces prove there are still ways to break boundaries in the diamond world.""It's the new generations who are going to bring a new take on jewelry. We don't have to keep wearing or interpreting jewelry in the same way,"" she says.Vincenzo DiminoJewelry, and diamonds in particular, the actress agrees, can be incredibly personal. They can be much more than just beautiful, high-priced pieces we like to look at. A jewelry collection can be passed down for generations, it can carry different meanings and morph and be modernized through the years—take Duchess Kate's inherited jewelry from Princess Diana, for example.De Armas says there is one piece she bought herself that she cherishes above all others: an antique ring that reminds her of her grandmother.""I had a ring from my grandma that I'm pretty sure was not a diamond, but it was this dark red stone with little things around it, and I lost it at the airport and I was so, so, so, so sad,"" she recalls in a conversation with BAZAAR. ""And years went by, and then I was shooting a movie and we were shooting on the street and I bumped into an antique store and I found the version of that ring—same color, but this time real diamonds—and I had to get it. It wasn't my grandma's ring, but it just reminds me of her. I have it here, actually, because I always wear it."" Maybe not as meaningful but equally dazzling were the jewels de Armas got to wear while filming the 2021 James Bond film No Time to Die with Daniel Craig.""That was beautiful—such an incredible touch for the character. Everything was so simple but I just felt like the jewelry really matched her personality: so sparkly and shiny and happy,"" de Armas says.Vincenzo DiminoWalking around the NDC event, where the young designers showcased their diamond creations, the actress couldn't keep her eyes off Birthright Foundry's Heritage Diamond Ula Nifo choker, crafted from 18-karat yellow gold and natural white diamonds but inspired by whale tooth necklaces from Samoa. The Ula Nifo necklace was worn by Samoan chiefs and their children in ancient times, and signified wealth and status, designer Constance Polamalu explains.""It's just so different,"" de Armas says.Grant Mobley, a diamond and fine jewelry expert at the NDC, tells BAZAAR how rare and exciting it is to see a high-jewelry piece so influenced by a designer's underrepresented culture, and yet so wearable today.""If you think back to these incredible Samoan jewelry designs with the amazing necklace collars from well over 100 years ago, she's turning that into something that makes sense for the modern day, and she's also doing that with fine jewelry materials: gold, diamonds,"" he says. ""It's something that might've been worn hundreds of years ago by her ancestors, but she's making it something that she would wear and that you would see on the red carpet.""The collections of the latest EDDI class of designers—Casey Perez, Corey Anthony Jones, Lana Ogilvie (Sabre Jewelry), Mckenzie Liautaud, Halle Millien (Heart the Stones), and Ruben Manuel—will launch this Friday, June 17, on 1stDibs.

7 Bag Trends That’ll Be Everywhere in 2022,"Storing your jewelry can be an afterthought to wearing your jewelry. But your pendants and cocktail rings are still on display to you, in your home, when you're not wearing them. Now, there's a collaboration to replace a dresser-top tangle of gold and silver with something more organized and refined.Mejuri enlisted Claude Home founder Maggie Holladay to design two ceramic vessels for displaying and storing your bracelets, earrings, and rings. Nested together or placed separately, the two asymmetric marble containers are as much miniature sculptures as they are dishes for your everyday stack. They also have shades of the function-meets-art-forms seen in Claude Home's signature vases and vessels. MejuriThe collaboration is technically Mejuri's first foray into home goods. But Mejuri has dabbled outside of bijoux in the past, racking up waiting lists of 5,000-plus people for its jewelry boxes and travel sets. Plus, Noura Sakkijha, Mejuri co-founder and CEO, tells us she has always had a deep, personal interest in interiors. ""I love how a space can be transformed with the most subtle curation of elevated and multifunctional objects,"" she says.

Claude Home and Mejuri Created the Actual Chicest Jewelry Holders,"Lately I wonder if we’re living through a mass psychosis expressing itself through trend reporting. If it felt a year ago like anything goes—that the restrictions and trauma of the pandemic highlighted fashion and self-expression as a new outlet for freedom—increasingly it seems that there are a thousand trends happening at once. In just the past month, I have read stories about a new twist on the girlboss trend called “that girl,” a trend in which women really enjoy themselves, and a trend in which women enjoy themselves a little, plus “dinocore,” “clowncore,” and “twee.” On TikTok, trend forecasting has become the new influencer hustle, almost a trend itself; creators who can string together photographic evidence with a pithy and compelling monologue are performing a kind of competitive prophecy. And the platform’s algorithm seems to favor this sort of information sharing: the more ridiculous the prediction, the more traction it gains, and the more predictions we are fed. In the meantime, fast fashion brands like Shein have sped production to such a pace that they can both predict and reflect these trends, making them feel all the more real while we ping pong through “feels” and “vibes” with no aesthetic compass. Even runway fashion, which is supposed to move at a slower, biannual speed, has joined this rat race, as designers pack their shows with potential viral moments and styles that are replicable by anyone with a little ingenuity and a pair of scissors. The tempo of fashion makes everything feel quick, carefree, and, sometimes, unfortunately, even careless. Mostly it seems that people are doing things humans have done for most of the past century—relaxing, working hard, having martinis, not having martinis—but now we cannot resist the urge to package them into something that feels more meaningful than mere consumer choices.Jerry Lorenzo, the 44-year-old designer behind the brand Fear of God, is a man who has started many trends himself (real trends, that is). When he began his brand almost a decade ago, it was a luxury cornerstone of the hypebeast movement, which often encourages a cut-throat, product-driven style of consumerism. Lorenzo worked on an early season of Yeezy alongside then-Vetements designer Demna, and, after making T-shirts for Justin Bieber’s “Purpose” tour, helped turn merch into meaningful clothes. He was a close friend of and collaborator with the late Virgil Abloh, whose brand Off-White propelled streetwear to the forefront of fashion, and his sneakers and sweatpants remain staples in hip corridors of Los Angeles and New York. But lately, Lorenzo has been on a different kind of fashion journey. In early 2020 he collaborated with Ermenegildo Zegna’s Alessandro Sartori for a collection that shifted menswear’s inner circle’s attitude around suiting, making it feel less performative and more like a staple. And now his collections, which arrive on his own time rather than seasonally, serve a slower, even higher purpose. Today, he is releasing a new collection, his first in nearly two years. As he worked on it, he said in a video interview late last week, he asked himself of every garment, “Is this timeless?”“I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now,” he said. “And I want to provide a safe space for someone that wants to step outside of that, but can still step into that conversation with everyone else that’s of ‘the now’ and feel of ‘the now,’ but not have to be so on trend.” Instead, what he wants his clothing to do is help his customers “feel the confidence. I want them to feel sophisticated, but I want them to feel the freedom to be themselves and know that it’s not the trend that validates you. It’s the individual that you are.” Lorenzo calls this collection Eternal. And while the clothing is a natural progression of the easy elegance of the collections he dropped in late summer and fall of 2020, it seems quite radical, to me, to proclaim you want to defy the trend cycle and try to make something that has lasting value. It seems so obvious, to try to float above it all, and yet the intoxicating quest for relevance has made it a rare impulse. Lorenzo is almost dipping into the realm of slow fashion—of designers with far less recognizable names who rarely stage fashion shows, like the 19th-century inspired work of Paul Harnden, the simple French cottons of Casey Casey, or the heady beauty of Elena Dawson. They make clothing that is intentionally hard to find and difficult to make. Lorenzo hasn’t gone that far, of course, and he has in his corner the fact that his clothing is meant to make you feel as comfortable in a suit as you are in your favorite sweatshirt. That means it has the potential to transcend the cognoscenti customer of slow fashion brands, or perhaps convert recovering hypebeasts into cognoscenti. He is designing with incredible thoughtfulness, even integrity–almost like a novel. “I approach it like a book or a music album,” said Lorenzo of putting together collections. “I don't really approach it in terms of seasons and seasonality. I approach it like, Hey, do I have something to say? Do I have the resources to say what I wanna say in the best way?” He remains independently owned–he also has a partnership with Adidas, where he serves as the head of strategy for their basketball category—and his resources are just catching up to his point of view, as he put it. He’s been able to move 80% of his production to Italy, for example. “And so hopefully each time we have something to say, it’s better than the last thing we said.” Lorenzo, of course, isn’t the only designer to prize continual improvement over novelty. The Row’s Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen come to mind, and Lorenzo, like The Row and other influential American aesthetes, is particularly drawn, lately, to the 1980s and ’90s designs of Giorgio Armani. His cascades of beige in flowing, almost spiritually understated cuts wrote a new script for minimalism. If Prada was cerebral, edgy, and obscure, and Calvin Klein was sexy, Armani was, just as Lorenzo said, a man of confidence, whose clothing blessed its wearers with a feeling of monastic chic weightlessness. “I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now.”In Eternal, the cuts are generous without swamping their wearer in fabric; the tones are bones, milky beiges, and greyish whites; and nearly all the pants blur the line between a structured trouser and a cozy sweatpant. You can see how a person dressed in these clothes might calm a room of investors or subtly change the energy in a coffee shop line. “I am in fashion, and I do love to present myself a certain way,” Lorenzo mused. “But that’s always been something that is understated. It’s always been something that isn’t loud and doesn’t call for attention. As quiet as I want to be in a room, I also want to be competent, you know?” Like Armani—and again, like The Row—Lorenzo is thinking about how his clothing might provide solutions, not only to the holes in your wardrobe but to your own questions about your sense of self. How do you wear a suit, which has different proportions and fabrics than a hoodie or track pants, and still feel like yourself? “That’s what I’m always chasing, you know? How can I be always sophisticated in the way that I present myself, but honest, and relaxed and comfortable?” Lorenzo’s evolution as a designer over the past decade, from a Los Angeles DJ to a new hero in intentional clothing creation, has been one of fashion’s most interesting. By staying independent, he’s allowed himself the time to grow and explore that investors or big luxury house appointments rarely afford. Too often, a designer’s references are too readily apparent, too surface—Ralph Lauren’s Polo line, or Annie Leibowitz’s images for The Gap, or the wackadoo spirit of 1980s couture that seems to have captured the imagination of many young womenswear designers in New York. In fact, prior to his dalliance with Zegna, Lorenzo spoke about wanting to build a brand like Lauren’s. But Lorenzo has a new modesty about him, and his clothing feels intimate in a way that Lauren’s, which is much more like a worshipful encyclopedia of American style, simply cannot. We talked about how opting out of trendiness can be quite boring—depending on how many viscose trouser-wearing influencers you follow on Instagram, you might say it’s even something of a trend itself—and how he’s tweaked his pieces, and played with fabrics, to give his pieces some heart and some personality. Changing the shoulder on a jacket from a past collection to make it feel less 1980s, for example. The result is that these are real clothes, for someone who is not trying to create a look for a moment in time, but who believes fashion can improve your life in small but significant ways.Open GalleryRachel TashjianRachel Tashjian is the Fashion News Director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.

5 Jewelry Trends Worth Adding to Your Collection This Summer,"No one does glamour quite like Anya Taylor-Joy. So, to no one's surprise, The Queen's Gambit star looked incredible at the 73rd annual Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles last night.

10 Hair Trends to Try for Summer 2022,"MoAna Luu has spent her professional life building brands, from designing boutique hotels to serving as chief content and creative officer at Essence. But after contracting Covid-19 in March 2020, Luu decided to refocus on a new brand-building effort—one that’s entirely her own. That project is ManLuu, a line of luxury jewelry paying homage to Luu’s Creole heritage—a blend of African, Indian, French, and Caribbean traditions—and Martinique’s long tradition of jewelry-making. ManLuu arrives today at Nordstrom for its official, 21-item debut following a soft online launch this summer. ManLuu is composed of gender neutral earrings, bracelets, and rings in 18k gold vermeil and sterling silver. Nods to Creole jewelry tradition emerge through ManLuu’s use of exaggerated geometric shapes and signature woven patterns (an octagonal hoop with webbed inlays here, a chunky beaded bracelet there). ""The craftsmanship is something that is so delicate, when you see it you know you have a precious piece already,"" Luu says.More From Harper's BAZAARSome of the designer's earliest introductions to Creole craftsmanship came from her grandparents’ jewelry store in Fort-de-France, Martinique, Luu tells BAZAAR.com. But ManLuu’s devotion to quality is inspired by even earlier references, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. At that time, Black people could not become property owners, so they invested in gold jewelry heirlooms to pass down among generations. Luu says that ManLuu shares the power of this story, one that many people may not know, through each piece.MoAna Luu at the ManLuu atelier in New York City.ManLuuManLuu’s interpretation of heirloom jewelry had resonated long before this week’s Nordstrom launch. Gwyneth Paltrow, Mary J. Blige, and Maye Musk are a few of its early fans. Cardi B. even wore ManLuu bangles to announce her second pregnancy earlier this year—a special stamp of approval for the brand, Luu tells us. Joining forces with a large retailer like Nordstrom is, in some ways, even more significant than those celebrity endorsements. ""As a Black female designer and founder, I believe it's important that heritage brands welcome new creators and support them taking their place in the luxury market,"" Luu explains. ""This is a big step, not just for me, but for all of us.""While ManLuu's approach to luxury references centuries-old jewelry traditions, its use of eco-friendly materials is thoroughly 2021.

Luu couldn't imagine starting a new label without incorporating conscious design techniques: “Sustainability is something that, today, is mandatory in any business.""

The 27 Best Closet and Jewelry Organizers for Decluttering Your Space,"No one can take a time-out from the Y2K fashion revival. Not even our iPhones. Like bucket hats and platform flip flops before them, phone straps of the early aughts variety are having a renaissance. Think of these attachable lanyards like the camp jewelry trend, but for your phone. The plainest phone straps start with rainbow-colored resin beads and get kitschier from there. Entire indie brands are dedicated to beaded phone straps, with String Ting, GriGri, and Hang On credited in mirror selfies across Instagram. Established accessories players are catching on, with versions appearing at Roxanne Assoulin and Lele Sadoughi. View full post on InstagramAlex Bass, founder at phone strap seller Hang On, says Y2K nostalgia is a big part of her brand. Hang On’s aesthetic harkens back to the days when cell phones were a novelty and personalizing them was a compulsion—the more glitter, the better. In Bass’s case, she stuck “stickers and rhinestones on every square centimeter of the phone, à la Carrie Bradshaw.”More From Harper's BAZAARBut there’s more to the phone strap trend than 2000 calling to give our lucky charms back,  String Ting founder Rachel Steed-Middleton tells BAZAAR.com. “The ‘smartphone-is-my-life’ way of being is more current and of the times, so this is really a very new and modern-day category of accessorizing,” she says.

Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, and Kaia Gerber have all been spotted with String Tings dangling from their phones.“Being more connected to our devices naturally makes us think about what they look like and how we can personalize them,” Bass agrees. “With Hang On, we’ve tried to capitalize on this trend but also reshape its narrative.” The brand offers two-for-one discounts on its charms—to encourage shoppers to buy one for a friend, and remind them to stay in touch.

9 Micro Trends from New York Fashion Week,"Thanks to an early passion for vintage fashion, jewelry designer Pamela Love knows her way around sartorial classics. For her, shopping isn't just about finding things that are aesthetically pleasing; instead, she looks for elegant pieces with eye-catching details and rich backstories. ""Finding a great vintage item is like winning the lottery. It's completely unique and special and has a story behind it,"" she says. Here, Love takes us on a vintage shopping excursion at Brooklyn's Amarcord, explaining what she's always hunting for and why clothing can sometimes take a backseat to stunning jewelry.From: ELLE US"
25 Minimalist Jewelry Finds You Can Buy on Amazon,"Katie Kova is petite, quietly spoken, and very chic (think simple, understated style that conveys a quiet sort of elegance). Her newly launched fine jewelry label, Kova, follows in much the same vein. ""My jewelry is 100% wearable, stackable, mixable, and day-to-night viable,"" she says. ""I wear it with a T-shirt and flats and with a cocktail dress and stilettos.""Inspired by the 20th-century Russian art movement Suprematism (invented by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich, it was one of the earliest and most radical developments in abstract art), Kova's pieces possess the same sort of graphic, linear construction and minimalist feel as her favorite artworks. An ear cuff features circles and zig zag lines embedded with dozens of black and white pave diamonds, while a pair of triangular earrings have slight differences in each side. ""At Kova we see jewelry as a form of wearable creation,"" she says. ""We begin with analysis, researching shapes, lines, concepts, references, textures, inspirations, fits, and even variable degrees of shine—that´s how nerdy we can be. It´s all about the conceptual and creative challenges of launching a line that's cohesive, unique, and by all means; beautiful."" Sally GriffithsFor the Moscow-born, London-based designer, jewelry wasn't her first calling. Rather, she studied business before leaping into the world of accessories. ""I always knew that I´d start my own project and that it would be a creative one. Even when I was studying business I was interested in architecture and design,"" she explains. ""Jewelry is my true passion. The minute my grandfather gave me my first piece of jewelry when I was 14, I became an ad hoc jewelry researcher. Kova is the result of that informal education and my very formal business studies."" And while her homeland provides much of the inspiration, Kova's London base also delivers plenty of influences. ""Russia gave me a vast cultural legacy: The unparalleled graphic influence of artists Rodchenko, Malevich, and Kandinsky—to name just three. London on the other hand stimulated my creativity as an individual. It´s a city of creativity, talent, and brains that has made my vision so much more versatile.""More From Harper's BAZAARHer sculptural, minimalist pieces are also a step away from traditional fine jewelry, especially those that she grew up around. ""In Russia, fine jewelry is passed from generation to generation so it´s highly valued. Collecting fine jewelry has been a tradition in my family for generations. My favorite piece is the Tiffany & Co. bracelet that my grandfather gave me when I was 14. I still wear it all the time. It's not about trends, it´s about design integrity and the best stones."" In a rapidly changing accessories market, Kova's pieces personify a new approach to fine jewelry—unlike traditional fine jewels there's no need to keep them locked in a vault or only worn on special occasions. ""Women today understand fine jewelry as a wearable accessory rather than just an investment,"" agrees Kova. Her own personal approach to fashion and style is indicative of the change. ""I am not a girly girl but I´m not masculine either. I appreciate femininity but not in its literal instance. You won´t see me in ruffles and bows, you'll see me in pieces that are understated and elegant. I love wearing clothes that empower you, that give you confidence.""Read more from Tara from PROFYLES.com."

The Top Bridal Trends for 2022 Weddings,"Media Platforms Design TeamWith Earth Day coming up on Friday, the model and green activist chatted with us about her latest collaboration with Guy Bedarida of John Hardy. (Below left, one of the lovely recycled sterling-silver pieces.)How did the collaboration with Guy Bedarida come about? Very organically — Guy and I were introduced a few years ago and connected right away. Guy invited me to Bali — where he lives and the John Hardy workshop is located — to meet with him, the local artisans and see the compound. I was so inspired by the island's beauty and the local people that Guy and I began discussing how we could collaborate on a jewelry collection that would represent my visit. Bamboo is a ubiquitous plant in Bali so it was important for us to incorporate it into our designs and we did, you can see the Hijau (meaning ""green"" in Balinese) collection showcases the look of sliced bamboo. This year we are proud to launch Hijau Dua, our second collaboration.What were some of the biggest challenges and surprises that came up in the process?More From Harper's BAZAARDesigning the jewelry was exciting and challenging all at once.  One can never know how meticulous the design process is until they witness it firsthand.  First comes the sketch, then the mold is created and then the piece is cast; in the case of Hijau Dua in recycled sterling silver or 18K gold.  I was so impressed by the attention to detail Guy and his artisans pay to each and every piece of handcrafted jewelry.As someone who's previously been on the other side of the coin, what was it like designing pieces as opposed to modeling them?While I do love my work, I've always felt quite comfortable on the ""other side.""  I feel a great sense of accomplishment when I've worked hard to create something and see it come to life.What was your favorite aspect of your trip to Bali?The Balinese people are truly amazing.  They have such a commitment to nature and their surroundings.  It really blew me away to see how they take such pride in their work and utilizing everything the earth provides.We know you've been an eco-activist for some time. What do you hope will result from this collaboration, in terms of raising awareness about the environment?Yes, I have been committed to this for several years now and I think the best thing we can do to create true awareness is to educate. I even started my own foundation, Collage, a non-profit that tackles environmental and social issues through various partnerships and events. My collaboration with John Hardy is meant to inspire people everywhere to see that each and every one of us can make a difference in our own way.  For this collection, we are donating a portion of sales to John Hardy's ""Wear Bamboo, Plant Bamboo"" program, which plants a number of bamboo seedlings for every piece of jewelry sold.This content is imported from youTube.

Band of Outsiders, inspired by the Japanese dyeing techniques of shibori, took a more relaxed and wavy approach to the magic eye version of herringbone.

The Coolest Nail Trends For 2021,"Gaydamak's sparkling but tough, futuristic yet intricately wrought fine jewelry pieces feel like they're changing the game.Parisian sisters Sonia and Katia Gaydamak launched the brand in 2009 with an emphasis on the hand bracelet and have found a strong editorial footing, fans with means and count ladies like Natalia Vadianova amongst devotees. The sisters have the clout to match their unqiue aesthetic — both graduated from the New York Gemological Institute of America. BAZAAR spoke with the pair who split their time between London and Paris about making the ancient current and their signature piece.Harper's Bazaar: The pieces are beautiful but also feel innovative, what was your starting point for launching Gaydamak?Soni Gaydamak: It began with a desire to want to do something together. Our love for stones and passion for gemology made us look into that direction. We grew up in a house where most of the objects weren't used in a traditional or conventional way, so it made sense that our jewelry would follow the same destiny.More From Harper's BAZAARHB: What are the places/items that are inspiring you now?Katia Gaydamak: We have a fabulous collection of books on ancient fabrics. We like to reinterpret the ancient. But also the people we have met over the last few months, such as Zaha Hadid, have left a indelible mark on our collection to come.Media Platforms Design TeamHB: The hand bracelet is obviously the star, where did the idea come from? SG: Since we started, we wanted to add a signature piece to our name, but nothing really special came to mind. Katia was wearing a traditional bracelet that was too big, it fell on to her palm towards her fingers and that was it! It took a year for the development of the project and another year to get into the right retaillers over Europe and the US.HB: You are both certified gemologists, how has that helped your roles as designers specifically? SG: We like to chose the stones, gold and setters ourself. We travel to Asia, Israel or New York if we know we will find a special gem. But what is most important for us, is to find harmony between our sketches and the ultimate result.HB: What is your design process like? KG: Our mood boards are the most important moment in the creation of a new piece. We like to be overwelmed with ideas and then select what will be in the final product. ""Creativity is a full time job"" and not a moment. We like to sit and brain storm through various images, books and memories.HB: Who would you live to see wear Gaydamak?KG: In all fairness, we like the woman who thinks outside the box. A woman who feels free and strong yet feminine and sexy.HB: How would you describe the aesthetic of the brand? SG: Just like the woman that wears it — free. HB: What is it like being in business with your sister? How do you work together?SG: We initially wanted to seperate the tasks but as time went by we realized that we needed each other's input on all matters.KG: Officially Sonia is in charge of the development and me of design. But in reality, we can't be seperated for more than an hour!Kerry PieriDigital Fashion/Features DirectorKerry Pieri is Harper's Bazaar's Digital Fashion/Features Director.

The Coolest Summer 2021 Nail Art Trends,"We don't want to be so pedestrian as to call out a color of the season, but when there's a hue as rich and, let's face it, pretty, as a deep emerald green showing up all over the runway, we would be remiss not to mention it. Jason Wu took his green to military inspired places, while Peter Som's peplum dress erred more on the side of ladylike. Securing its place in a three-way trend, Yigal Azrouel used green in leather suiting for the cool girl. We also just saw some lovely gowns in the jewel tone at Wes Gordon as well, which is leading us to believe this micro-trend may progress to mass trend by week's end.Kerry PieriDigital Fashion/Features DirectorKerry Pieri is Harper's Bazaar's Digital Fashion/Features Director.

Jewelry Designer Pamela Love on Finding Great Vintage Pieces,"It sounds macabre when you say it, but looks very chic — if not a touch gothic — when you see it. We're referring to the growing ubiquity of ox blood on the Fall 2012 runways. We've concentrated on the use of the saturated hue on outwear, as seen at Alexander Wang, Tommy Hilfiger and Helmut Lang. The deeper shade of crimson is surprisingly versatile and can act as a neutral or an unexpected, rich alternative to black. Perhaps this trend is a residual affect of that never-ending pop culture obsession with all things vampiric.

"This Jewelry Was Inspired by Suprematism, See Why","Usually, when Phoebe Bridgers talks about the moon, she's singing to a group of crying fans (I am, admittedly, one of them) who are mouthing the words to her ""Moon Song."" But last week, she could be found talking about astronomy in a not-heart-wrenching context—while wearing Chanel jewelry inspired by the stars. Standing underneath a crescent moon on a stage in Los Angeles, she introduced the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who were performing for Chanel’s guests at a dinner celebrating the launch of the 1932 jewelry collection, which is the second one ever released by the brand. The crowd cheered, but the 18-karat Coco Crush earrings and bracelet adorning Bridgers’s earlobes and wrist were beautiful enough that they could have elicited tears (of jealousy). Phoebe Bridgers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinIt has been 90 years since Gabrielle Chanel designed Bijoux de Diamants, the first high jewelry collection in history. It was created three years after Black Thursday pushed the world into the Great Depression, and Chanel was determined to create something that could shine through the turmoil. The 50-piece collection was made of white and yellow diamonds set in platinum and yellow gold, with 22 pieces inspired by specific constellations. “Nothing could be better for forgetting the crisis than feasting one’s eyes on beautiful new things,” she said of the collection. And so it feels fitting that in 2022, nearly three years after the entire world stood still for the pandemic, the fashion house she built would respond to our somber times with something just as sumptuous.More From Harper's BAZAARThe Yeah Yeah Yeahs performing at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinLike the original Bijoux de Diamants collection, the design of 1932 is harmonized around three symbols: the comet, the moon, and the sun. Chanel muses like Marion Cotillard, Lori Harvey, Greta Lee, and Whitney Peak were in attendance at the West Hollywood celebration, and, like Bridgers, were also layered in pieces from the 1932 collection named after the cosmos. Maggie Rogers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection. Pat MartinSinger Maggie Rogers, who also recently graduated from Harvard’s Divinity School, wore five rings from the collection but said the shooting star Comète ear cuff in 18-karat gold was her favorite. On the Chanel black carpet, Rogers mentioned how she felt a kinship with Gabrielle over her affinity for outer space: “[The cosmos] is something that has always resonated with me and is very apparent and present in my musical work.” Gossip Girl’s Whitney Peak said the collection made her feel like a “superstar” before joking, “I feel like I shouldn’t be wearing it. I don’t know how they let me get away with this!” and then grasping the 1932 Comète Couture necklace in 18-karat gold and diamonds around her neck. Whitney Peak at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinWhile there are 77 pieces in the collection, its signature piece is the Allure Céleste necklace, with round-cut diamonds, an oval sapphire of deep blue, and a weight of 55.5 carats. What makes it extraordinary is its ability to transform: The halos detach to become brooches, and the central row of diamonds becomes a bracelet, converting the necklace into a shorter version. Thirteen other pieces from the 1932 collection also have the ability to transform in a similar manner, allowing the wearer to make new diamond constellations around their wrists and necks.Guests dining at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinMany of the pieces were made without clasps, something Gabrielle Chanel openly disliked. “I detest clasps! I’ve done away with clasps! Yet my jewelry is transformable,” she said in an interview in 1932 after the “Bijoux de Diamants” exhibition. She strived to design pieces that offered flexibility to busy women with full lives, and that didn’t impede their freedom. And as the jewelry-spangled guests left their cares behind to dance under a canopy of baby’s breath, it was evident that the new 1932 collection stays true to her vision.Tara GonzalezTara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.

Five Fall Color Trends from the Runway,"Prada has never done things by the book. The brand has been creating the world's most desirable fashion pieces since their start over one hundred years ago, going from making humble leather goods to being one of the biggest privately owned brands in the world. Now, the brand is expanding on their aesthetic universe with a daring introduction into fine jewelry. The inaugural collection, titled ETERNAL GOLD, marks both a commitment to beauty and to sustainable, circular fashion.Maya Hawke for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsAs Prada's first-ever fine jewelry offering, ETERNAL GOLD is a first in many aspects. It's also the world's first fine jewelry collection made entirely with recycled gold, collected using the industry's most rigorous standards set by the Responsible Jewelry Council. Prada is also the first company to expand on diamond traceability, making every single carat count traceable down to its origins. The complete transparency of every material used in their jewelry, from sourcing to cutting to setting, is a radical step in the direction of honest production for an otherwise murky process. Somi Jeon for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsThe jewelry is a reflection of Prada's impact on the industry and a continuation of their efforts to creating beautiful objects that stands the test of time, as all fine jewelry should. ETERNAL GOLD is rife with Pradaisms, with the instantly recognizable Prada triangle rendered as sleek earrings and pendants, but also imbued in clasp closures, and more subtly, in chain links and as the head and tail of the snake bracelet.  The snake bracelet itself may at first recall other serpent bracelets, but finds its own voice with the sneaky Prada triangle and smooth, unvarnished gold. Heart pendants take on an edgy effect with the triangle chainlink it sits on.More From Harper's BAZAARCourtesyCourtesyPrada chose three voices of our time to don this foundational collection, representing where Prada is now and where it can go. Amanda Gorman, award-winning poet and activist, Maya Hawke, singer/songwriter, actress, and model, and Somi Jeon, musician, become one with the gold, immortalized in gold negative renderings by David Sims. The jewelry and its campaign represent the future of a wholly responsible planet that isn't sacrificing purity and beauty at its demise. The act of both looking good and doing good is something all brands should aim toward.From: ELLE USKevin LeBlancKevin LeBlanc is the Fashion Associate at ELLE Magazine.

Fall 2010's Top Fashion Trends,"Is any woman as synonymous with another creature as Mariah Carey is with a butterfly?This week, the singer celebrated the 30th anniversary of the release of her groundbreaking album Butterfly, and now she celebrates the arrival of her collaboration with the jeweler Chopard, which launches in stores and online today, September 16. The pieces, a mix of butterflies rendered in diamonds on rings, bracelets, earrings, and a breathtaking statement necklace, commemorate Carey’s  longtime affinity for the creature who helped her conceptualize her life as an independent artist at the top of a male-dominated music industry. She describes the process of seeing and wearing the pieces, while simultaneously celebrating “my favorite album that I’ve done,” as an emotional experience. “It’s a major moment, and it’s a full circle moment,” she says. Here she tells us about conceptualizing the collection, her daily jewelry wardrobe, and how she will wear the pieces.Harper’s Bazaar: I want to start by talking about this incredible butterfly necklace. Mariah Carey: Oh my gosh.HB: The butterfly, of course, is this incredibly significant symbol of transformation for you. But seeing the butterfly rendered in diamonds reminded me of how dazzling they are. They’re the most beautiful living creatures. And I wondered if you learned anything about the butterfly, seeing it rendered in diamonds. The enduring symbol of the butterfly—I mean, we can go on and on about different people's interpretations and feelings. My own personal feelings are so very specific to my album Butterfly and that period of my life, which we are celebrating the anniversary of this year, [coincidentally] at the same time that this is all happening, right? Because we've been working on this [with Chopard] for two years together, and it happened by accident [that] we’re re-releasing the Butterfly album, which is my favorite album that I’ve done.And yes, I have a very specific relationship with the butterfly and just the whole metamorphosis of it. The way that I had to come through a very difficult time in my life and, you know, like they say, you’ve gotta go through something to get something. I had to get to that place where I felt empowered enough to metaphorically fly and be free from that place where I was. I started out in this industry as such a young girl in a really difficult world, dominated by men. I wrote this song as I was leaving this mansion that I had paid for half of, and [where] I had sort of created my own little prison, not really deliberately, but it ended up feeling that way. And I was leaving and I wrote the lyrics and the melody to [the song “Butterfly”]: Spread your wings and prepare to fly / for you have become a butterfly. And so that’s always stuck with me. I’ve made many albums since then, but it’s just very specific to me. So to see this magnificent butterfly necklace, and the ring—I mean, it was so much to even be able to say, I collaborated on this. To be able to admire the craft—I don’t want to say “craftsmanship.” Please give me another word.HB: The creation, the artistry?The artistry! That’s what it is. Just to be able to collaborate with Chopard and doing this collection is a humongous honor. I’m just here, ready to put some diamonds on and hang out. Whatever! Courtesy of Chopard.HB: What is your daily jewelry wardrobe? Are we wearing the butterfly ring every day and the necklace for special occasions? Or is there a different routine here?I am not really one for routines of any sort. I’m not a dancer. I don’t really like to follow rules. So I would wear any piece on any occasion. But right now i’m wearing a bracelet that my daughter made for me that says “Lamily” on it, which is an homage to my fans made of little beads and elastic, with some diamond bracelets. I would wear any piece from the collection in a casual moment, or more specifically the Happy Butterfly collection, which I love so much. I think they’re gonna look gorgeous stacked with even just a T-shirt and jeans, leggings, a simple dress. There’s just really great pieces that are attainable, as well as those gorgeous—I don’t find them over the top, some might say they are; they’re major—pieces that I live for.They are really major. And they feel so you. I can see you wearing this incredible butterfly necklace with a T-shirt, or these enormous leaf earrings.I would do that! I’m so ready to wear those. When Caroline [Scheufele, the president of Chopard] was evolving and creating them, she was explaining them to me and I knew exactly what she meant, but when I saw them, I was losing it. I mean, they’re just sick. It’s beyond. They’re so good. [Laughs.]Sounds like you and Caroline had good chemistry.I feel like Caroline probably has incredible chemistry with anyone cuz she’s so fun and carefree. I love that about her. She’s also an artist and a businesswoman, and to work with her to make this collection together, [it feels] even more extra special because it was my idea and I was able to watch it happen.Courtesy of Chopard.Would you say it’s true that diamonds are a girl’s best friend?Well, considering the people I know, for sure. Maybe the exception of one or two. You know, at the end of the day, they’re not going to steer you wrong! Do you feel like jewelry plays an important part in your life spiritually? It can be armor, but it also reflects the essential feminine aspects of who you are.That’s interesting. I’ve never thought of it that way. There were little things, little pieces that I’ve had throughout my life, where they did have their own—I wouldn’t say spiritual, but they had a sort of special significance to me where I would keep them on no matter what. Swimming, whatever I was doing, I would keep them on. Because they were that special to me. And at one point I lost a piece of jewelry that I loved so much, and it wasn’t even that it was a major thing. It just meant something to me. But with this collection, everything means so much to me that I’m just excited to share it with the world.

""It made me appreciate silhouettes and cuts and color in a way I thought I had, but when you put it on camera, when you are trying to tell a story, you can see how clothing can do a lot of the work for you.""Of her personal wardrobe, she added, ""I love my T-shirts, and I love my vintage T-shirts.

Trending Now In Our Store: Solid & Striped,"Worn by celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, Kendall Jenner, Tracee Ellis Ross, Millie Bobby Brown, and more, the '90s- and Y2K-inspired braided tendril trend has only increased in popularity since its reemergence during the 2022 festival season. ""The tendril trend has always been an easy way to add a little 'razzle-dazzle' to any updo,"" Erinn Courtney, a natural hair expert at StyleSeat and celebrity stylist, tells BAZAAR.com. Typically crafted as a set of smaller, face-framing braids, braided tendrils are an easy way to elevate a go-to bun or ponytail. You can also quickly enhance a salon-quality blowout or beachy waves by adding a second pair of braids near the ears for a summery, carefree hair look.View full post on InstagramView full post on InstagramWhen it comes to the styling essentials needed for a braided tendril updo versus wearing your hair completely down, professionals say there isn't much difference in the products and tools to keep in your arsenal.

""I also recommend applying gel around the perimeter of the hair, brushing it upwards, then securing it with a hair tie.

The Best Jewelry from Amazon's Luxury Stores,"Ahead of the premiere of her much-awaited film Blonde, in which she portrays Marilyn Monroe, Ana de Armas is diving into a world Monroe knew quite a lot about: diamonds.The film and fashion icon famously sang ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" in the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and was known for her elegant style and love of high jewelry (remember when she wore the spectacular yellow diamond necklace dubbed The Moon of Baroda?). At the time, however, the diamond industry was seen as untouchable and unreachable for both ordinary buyers and small jewelry designers, and only big names, such as De Beers and Tiffany & Co., got the business and the notoriety. At the same time, conflict diamonds and diamond smuggling became real problems.Now, the Natural Diamond Council, along with brand ambassador de Armas, is looking to change that by backing young designers from around the world and educating buyers on the current state of the industry, which is moving toward a more sustainable and inclusive future.More From Harper's BAZAAR""I started working with the NDC in 2020, and I think it was a process for me of learning,"" de Armas tells BAZAAR.com at the NDC's launch event on June 14 at the Beekman Hotel penthouse in New York City, adding that she got to see how women in Botswana ran diamond mines and handled tractors, and essentially got to know the community behind the precious stones.    Vincenzo DiminoOn Tuesday, the NDC debuted the collections of the second class of artists from its Emerging Designers Diamond Initiative, which launched in January 2021 with $1 million of diamond credit dedicated to supporting emerging BIPOC jewelry designers, in partnership with Lorraine Schwartz.Per the NDC, ""The diamond industry is historically a generational and handshake industry where emerging designers without prior connections often experience barriers to entry. The program sets to level the playing field by providing direct, career-lasting relationships with diamantaires by underwriting $1 million in diamond credit in the designers’ own names. Industry education and resources, mentor pairings, and financial support for production and CAD designs are NDC’s efforts to help create a more equitable future.""Vincenzo DiminoDe Armas, wearing a brilliant ring and necklace from Dorian Webb and a ring from Heart the Stones by Halle Millien, says it's powerful the way in which the NDC is supporting—and financially backing—artists in the community who need the space to simply do what they're good at.""As a minority myself, I remember the days when I just wanted the chance to be in the room. I wanted to just be there. Give me the opportunity and I'll show you what I can offer,"" de Armas says. ""The fact that they're mentoring and supporting and opening the doors to relationships and careers and resources for these guys and giving them the credit is incredible.""The Cuban actress is no stranger to red-carpet glamour, and she has been dripped in diamonds for roles several times over the course of her film career, but she says the passion and originality of the up-and-coming jewelry designers' diamond pieces prove there are still ways to break boundaries in the diamond world.""It's the new generations who are going to bring a new take on jewelry. We don't have to keep wearing or interpreting jewelry in the same way,"" she says.Vincenzo DiminoJewelry, and diamonds in particular, the actress agrees, can be incredibly personal. They can be much more than just beautiful, high-priced pieces we like to look at. A jewelry collection can be passed down for generations, it can carry different meanings and morph and be modernized through the years—take Duchess Kate's inherited jewelry from Princess Diana, for example.De Armas says there is one piece she bought herself that she cherishes above all others: an antique ring that reminds her of her grandmother.""I had a ring from my grandma that I'm pretty sure was not a diamond, but it was this dark red stone with little things around it, and I lost it at the airport and I was so, so, so, so sad,"" she recalls in a conversation with BAZAAR. ""And years went by, and then I was shooting a movie and we were shooting on the street and I bumped into an antique store and I found the version of that ring—same color, but this time real diamonds—and I had to get it. It wasn't my grandma's ring, but it just reminds me of her. I have it here, actually, because I always wear it."" Maybe not as meaningful but equally dazzling were the jewels de Armas got to wear while filming the 2021 James Bond film No Time to Die with Daniel Craig.""That was beautiful—such an incredible touch for the character. Everything was so simple but I just felt like the jewelry really matched her personality: so sparkly and shiny and happy,"" de Armas says.Vincenzo DiminoWalking around the NDC event, where the young designers showcased their diamond creations, the actress couldn't keep her eyes off Birthright Foundry's Heritage Diamond Ula Nifo choker, crafted from 18-karat yellow gold and natural white diamonds but inspired by whale tooth necklaces from Samoa. The Ula Nifo necklace was worn by Samoan chiefs and their children in ancient times, and signified wealth and status, designer Constance Polamalu explains.""It's just so different,"" de Armas says.Grant Mobley, a diamond and fine jewelry expert at the NDC, tells BAZAAR how rare and exciting it is to see a high-jewelry piece so influenced by a designer's underrepresented culture, and yet so wearable today.""If you think back to these incredible Samoan jewelry designs with the amazing necklace collars from well over 100 years ago, she's turning that into something that makes sense for the modern day, and she's also doing that with fine jewelry materials: gold, diamonds,"" he says. ""It's something that might've been worn hundreds of years ago by her ancestors, but she's making it something that she would wear and that you would see on the red carpet.""The collections of the latest EDDI class of designers—Casey Perez, Corey Anthony Jones, Lana Ogilvie (Sabre Jewelry), Mckenzie Liautaud, Halle Millien (Heart the Stones), and Ruben Manuel—will launch this Friday, June 17, on 1stDibs.

Chanel Just Unveiled Its Most Opulent Jewelry in 90 Years,"Storing your jewelry can be an afterthought to wearing your jewelry. But your pendants and cocktail rings are still on display to you, in your home, when you're not wearing them.

Nested together or placed separately, the two asymmetric marble containers are as much miniature sculptures as they are dishes for your everyday stack.

"13 Fall 2022 Trends Worth Shopping, According to Fashion Insiders","Lately I wonder if we’re living through a mass psychosis expressing itself through trend reporting. If it felt a year ago like anything goes—that the restrictions and trauma of the pandemic highlighted fashion and self-expression as a new outlet for freedom—increasingly it seems that there are a thousand trends happening at once. In just the past month, I have read stories about a new twist on the girlboss trend called “that girl,” a trend in which women really enjoy themselves, and a trend in which women enjoy themselves a little, plus “dinocore,” “clowncore,” and “twee.” On TikTok, trend forecasting has become the new influencer hustle, almost a trend itself; creators who can string together photographic evidence with a pithy and compelling monologue are performing a kind of competitive prophecy. And the platform’s algorithm seems to favor this sort of information sharing: the more ridiculous the prediction, the more traction it gains, and the more predictions we are fed. In the meantime, fast fashion brands like Shein have sped production to such a pace that they can both predict and reflect these trends, making them feel all the more real while we ping pong through “feels” and “vibes” with no aesthetic compass. Even runway fashion, which is supposed to move at a slower, biannual speed, has joined this rat race, as designers pack their shows with potential viral moments and styles that are replicable by anyone with a little ingenuity and a pair of scissors. The tempo of fashion makes everything feel quick, carefree, and, sometimes, unfortunately, even careless. Mostly it seems that people are doing things humans have done for most of the past century—relaxing, working hard, having martinis, not having martinis—but now we cannot resist the urge to package them into something that feels more meaningful than mere consumer choices.Jerry Lorenzo, the 44-year-old designer behind the brand Fear of God, is a man who has started many trends himself (real trends, that is). When he began his brand almost a decade ago, it was a luxury cornerstone of the hypebeast movement, which often encourages a cut-throat, product-driven style of consumerism. Lorenzo worked on an early season of Yeezy alongside then-Vetements designer Demna, and, after making T-shirts for Justin Bieber’s “Purpose” tour, helped turn merch into meaningful clothes. He was a close friend of and collaborator with the late Virgil Abloh, whose brand Off-White propelled streetwear to the forefront of fashion, and his sneakers and sweatpants remain staples in hip corridors of Los Angeles and New York. But lately, Lorenzo has been on a different kind of fashion journey. In early 2020 he collaborated with Ermenegildo Zegna’s Alessandro Sartori for a collection that shifted menswear’s inner circle’s attitude around suiting, making it feel less performative and more like a staple. And now his collections, which arrive on his own time rather than seasonally, serve a slower, even higher purpose. Today, he is releasing a new collection, his first in nearly two years. As he worked on it, he said in a video interview late last week, he asked himself of every garment, “Is this timeless?”“I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now,” he said. “And I want to provide a safe space for someone that wants to step outside of that, but can still step into that conversation with everyone else that’s of ‘the now’ and feel of ‘the now,’ but not have to be so on trend.” Instead, what he wants his clothing to do is help his customers “feel the confidence. I want them to feel sophisticated, but I want them to feel the freedom to be themselves and know that it’s not the trend that validates you. It’s the individual that you are.” Lorenzo calls this collection Eternal. And while the clothing is a natural progression of the easy elegance of the collections he dropped in late summer and fall of 2020, it seems quite radical, to me, to proclaim you want to defy the trend cycle and try to make something that has lasting value. It seems so obvious, to try to float above it all, and yet the intoxicating quest for relevance has made it a rare impulse. Lorenzo is almost dipping into the realm of slow fashion—of designers with far less recognizable names who rarely stage fashion shows, like the 19th-century inspired work of Paul Harnden, the simple French cottons of Casey Casey, or the heady beauty of Elena Dawson. They make clothing that is intentionally hard to find and difficult to make. Lorenzo hasn’t gone that far, of course, and he has in his corner the fact that his clothing is meant to make you feel as comfortable in a suit as you are in your favorite sweatshirt. That means it has the potential to transcend the cognoscenti customer of slow fashion brands, or perhaps convert recovering hypebeasts into cognoscenti. He is designing with incredible thoughtfulness, even integrity–almost like a novel. “I approach it like a book or a music album,” said Lorenzo of putting together collections. “I don't really approach it in terms of seasons and seasonality. I approach it like, Hey, do I have something to say? Do I have the resources to say what I wanna say in the best way?” He remains independently owned–he also has a partnership with Adidas, where he serves as the head of strategy for their basketball category—and his resources are just catching up to his point of view, as he put it. He’s been able to move 80% of his production to Italy, for example. “And so hopefully each time we have something to say, it’s better than the last thing we said.” Lorenzo, of course, isn’t the only designer to prize continual improvement over novelty. The Row’s Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen come to mind, and Lorenzo, like The Row and other influential American aesthetes, is particularly drawn, lately, to the 1980s and ’90s designs of Giorgio Armani. His cascades of beige in flowing, almost spiritually understated cuts wrote a new script for minimalism. If Prada was cerebral, edgy, and obscure, and Calvin Klein was sexy, Armani was, just as Lorenzo said, a man of confidence, whose clothing blessed its wearers with a feeling of monastic chic weightlessness. “I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now.”In Eternal, the cuts are generous without swamping their wearer in fabric; the tones are bones, milky beiges, and greyish whites; and nearly all the pants blur the line between a structured trouser and a cozy sweatpant. You can see how a person dressed in these clothes might calm a room of investors or subtly change the energy in a coffee shop line. “I am in fashion, and I do love to present myself a certain way,” Lorenzo mused. “But that’s always been something that is understated. It’s always been something that isn’t loud and doesn’t call for attention. As quiet as I want to be in a room, I also want to be competent, you know?” Like Armani—and again, like The Row—Lorenzo is thinking about how his clothing might provide solutions, not only to the holes in your wardrobe but to your own questions about your sense of self. How do you wear a suit, which has different proportions and fabrics than a hoodie or track pants, and still feel like yourself? “That’s what I’m always chasing, you know? How can I be always sophisticated in the way that I present myself, but honest, and relaxed and comfortable?” Lorenzo’s evolution as a designer over the past decade, from a Los Angeles DJ to a new hero in intentional clothing creation, has been one of fashion’s most interesting. By staying independent, he’s allowed himself the time to grow and explore that investors or big luxury house appointments rarely afford. Too often, a designer’s references are too readily apparent, too surface—Ralph Lauren’s Polo line, or Annie Leibowitz’s images for The Gap, or the wackadoo spirit of 1980s couture that seems to have captured the imagination of many young womenswear designers in New York. In fact, prior to his dalliance with Zegna, Lorenzo spoke about wanting to build a brand like Lauren’s. But Lorenzo has a new modesty about him, and his clothing feels intimate in a way that Lauren’s, which is much more like a worshipful encyclopedia of American style, simply cannot. We talked about how opting out of trendiness can be quite boring—depending on how many viscose trouser-wearing influencers you follow on Instagram, you might say it’s even something of a trend itself—and how he’s tweaked his pieces, and played with fabrics, to give his pieces some heart and some personality. Changing the shoulder on a jacket from a past collection to make it feel less 1980s, for example. The result is that these are real clothes, for someone who is not trying to create a look for a moment in time, but who believes fashion can improve your life in small but significant ways.Open GalleryRachel TashjianRachel Tashjian is the Fashion News Director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.

Tiffany and Co.Tiffany and Co.The actress's breathtaking beauty look for the night was equally dramatic, with Taylor Joy opting for a matte complexion, flushed cheeks, neutral eye shadow, wispy lashes, and vibrant red lips. She wore her hair in a vintage-inspired, delicately styled bouffant, but added a modern, kitschy touch with a bright-yellow manicure as well. Taylor-Joy's red-carpet look was easily one of the standouts of the evening, winning over social media and best-dressed lists alike (including ours) for its fresh and timeless approach to red-carpet style and glamour.

10 Winter 2022 Bag Trends to Start Shopping Now,"MoAna Luu has spent her professional life building brands, from designing boutique hotels to serving as chief content and creative officer at Essence. But after contracting Covid-19 in March 2020, Luu decided to refocus on a new brand-building effort—one that’s entirely her own. That project is ManLuu, a line of luxury jewelry paying homage to Luu’s Creole heritage—a blend of African, Indian, French, and Caribbean traditions—and Martinique’s long tradition of jewelry-making. ManLuu arrives today at Nordstrom for its official, 21-item debut following a soft online launch this summer. ManLuu is composed of gender neutral earrings, bracelets, and rings in 18k gold vermeil and sterling silver. Nods to Creole jewelry tradition emerge through ManLuu’s use of exaggerated geometric shapes and signature woven patterns (an octagonal hoop with webbed inlays here, a chunky beaded bracelet there). ""The craftsmanship is something that is so delicate, when you see it you know you have a precious piece already,"" Luu says.More From Harper's BAZAARSome of the designer's earliest introductions to Creole craftsmanship came from her grandparents’ jewelry store in Fort-de-France, Martinique, Luu tells BAZAAR.com. But ManLuu’s devotion to quality is inspired by even earlier references, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. At that time, Black people could not become property owners, so they invested in gold jewelry heirlooms to pass down among generations. Luu says that ManLuu shares the power of this story, one that many people may not know, through each piece.MoAna Luu at the ManLuu atelier in New York City.ManLuuManLuu’s interpretation of heirloom jewelry had resonated long before this week’s Nordstrom launch. Gwyneth Paltrow, Mary J. Blige, and Maye Musk are a few of its early fans. Cardi B. even wore ManLuu bangles to announce her second pregnancy earlier this year—a special stamp of approval for the brand, Luu tells us. Joining forces with a large retailer like Nordstrom is, in some ways, even more significant than those celebrity endorsements. ""As a Black female designer and founder, I believe it's important that heritage brands welcome new creators and support them taking their place in the luxury market,"" Luu explains. ""This is a big step, not just for me, but for all of us.""While ManLuu's approach to luxury references centuries-old jewelry traditions, its use of eco-friendly materials is thoroughly 2021. Many pieces are crafted with recycled metals; later on, ManLuu will also incorporate lab-grown diamonds. Luu couldn't imagine starting a new label without incorporating conscious design techniques: “Sustainability is something that, today, is mandatory in any business."" By balancing meaningful history with modern design, ManLuu is an alternative to the throwaway jewelry sold, well, nearly everywhere. “Fast fashion was nice,” Luu says, “but now it’s time for pieces you want to keep.” And one day, pass down.Shop Manluu at NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$770 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Classic Beaded Necklace$2,650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Open Ring$600 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Cuff Bracelet$2,800 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$370 at NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$900 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Ear Jackets$1,000 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$570 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Embossed Ring$650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Long Beaded Necklace$4,200 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$470 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$1,100 at NordstromCredit: NordstromHalie LeSavageHalie LeSavage is the fashion commerce editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, where she covers everything from emerging designers to viral products to must-shop sales events.

The 10 Winter Nail Trends We Can't Wait to Wear,"No one can take a time-out from the Y2K fashion revival. Not even our iPhones. Like bucket hats and platform flip flops before them, phone straps of the early aughts variety are having a renaissance. Think of these attachable lanyards like the camp jewelry trend, but for your phone. The plainest phone straps start with rainbow-colored resin beads and get kitschier from there. Entire indie brands are dedicated to beaded phone straps, with String Ting, GriGri, and Hang On credited in mirror selfies across Instagram. Established accessories players are catching on, with versions appearing at Roxanne Assoulin and Lele Sadoughi. View full post on InstagramAlex Bass, founder at phone strap seller Hang On, says Y2K nostalgia is a big part of her brand. Hang On’s aesthetic harkens back to the days when cell phones were a novelty and personalizing them was a compulsion—the more glitter, the better. In Bass’s case, she stuck “stickers and rhinestones on every square centimeter of the phone, à la Carrie Bradshaw.”More From Harper's BAZAARBut there’s more to the phone strap trend than 2000 calling to give our lucky charms back,  String Ting founder Rachel Steed-Middleton tells BAZAAR.com. “The ‘smartphone-is-my-life’ way of being is more current and of the times, so this is really a very new and modern-day category of accessorizing,” she says.

Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, and Kaia Gerber have all been spotted with String Tings dangling from their phones.“Being more connected to our devices naturally makes us think about what they look like and how we can personalize them,” Bass agrees. “With Hang On, we’ve tried to capitalize on this trend but also reshape its narrative.” The brand offers two-for-one discounts on its charms—to encourage shoppers to buy one for a friend, and remind them to stay in touch.

Mariah Carey’s Butterfly Jewelry “Is a Major Moment”,"Thanks to an early passion for vintage fashion, jewelry designer Pamela Love knows her way around sartorial classics. For her, shopping isn't just about finding things that are aesthetically pleasing; instead, she looks for elegant pieces with eye-catching details and rich backstories. ""Finding a great vintage item is like winning the lottery. It's completely unique and special and has a story behind it,"" she says.

The 19 Best Ballet Flats That Transcend Shoe Trends,"Katie Kova is petite, quietly spoken, and very chic (think simple, understated style that conveys a quiet sort of elegance). Her newly launched fine jewelry label, Kova, follows in much the same vein. ""My jewelry is 100% wearable, stackable, mixable, and day-to-night viable,"" she says. ""I wear it with a T-shirt and flats and with a cocktail dress and stilettos.""Inspired by the 20th-century Russian art movement Suprematism (invented by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich, it was one of the earliest and most radical developments in abstract art), Kova's pieces possess the same sort of graphic, linear construction and minimalist feel as her favorite artworks. An ear cuff features circles and zig zag lines embedded with dozens of black and white pave diamonds, while a pair of triangular earrings have slight differences in each side. ""At Kova we see jewelry as a form of wearable creation,"" she says. ""We begin with analysis, researching shapes, lines, concepts, references, textures, inspirations, fits, and even variable degrees of shine—that´s how nerdy we can be. It´s all about the conceptual and creative challenges of launching a line that's cohesive, unique, and by all means; beautiful."" Sally GriffithsFor the Moscow-born, London-based designer, jewelry wasn't her first calling. Rather, she studied business before leaping into the world of accessories. ""I always knew that I´d start my own project and that it would be a creative one. Even when I was studying business I was interested in architecture and design,"" she explains. ""Jewelry is my true passion. The minute my grandfather gave me my first piece of jewelry when I was 14, I became an ad hoc jewelry researcher. Kova is the result of that informal education and my very formal business studies."" And while her homeland provides much of the inspiration, Kova's London base also delivers plenty of influences. ""Russia gave me a vast cultural legacy: The unparalleled graphic influence of artists Rodchenko, Malevich, and Kandinsky—to name just three. London on the other hand stimulated my creativity as an individual. It´s a city of creativity, talent, and brains that has made my vision so much more versatile.""More From Harper's BAZAARHer sculptural, minimalist pieces are also a step away from traditional fine jewelry, especially those that she grew up around. ""In Russia, fine jewelry is passed from generation to generation so it´s highly valued. Collecting fine jewelry has been a tradition in my family for generations. My favorite piece is the Tiffany & Co. bracelet that my grandfather gave me when I was 14. I still wear it all the time. It's not about trends, it´s about design integrity and the best stones."" In a rapidly changing accessories market, Kova's pieces personify a new approach to fine jewelry—unlike traditional fine jewels there's no need to keep them locked in a vault or only worn on special occasions. ""Women today understand fine jewelry as a wearable accessory rather than just an investment,"" agrees Kova. Her own personal approach to fashion and style is indicative of the change. ""I am not a girly girl but I´m not masculine either. I appreciate femininity but not in its literal instance. You won´t see me in ruffles and bows, you'll see me in pieces that are understated and elegant. I love wearing clothes that empower you, that give you confidence.""Read more from Tara from PROFYLES.com."

12 Trends that Define 2022 So Far,"Media Platforms Design TeamWith Earth Day coming up on Friday, the model and green activist chatted with us about her latest collaboration with Guy Bedarida of John Hardy. (Below left, one of the lovely recycled sterling-silver pieces.)How did the collaboration with Guy Bedarida come about? Very organically — Guy and I were introduced a few years ago and connected right away. Guy invited me to Bali — where he lives and the John Hardy workshop is located — to meet with him, the local artisans and see the compound. I was so inspired by the island's beauty and the local people that Guy and I began discussing how we could collaborate on a jewelry collection that would represent my visit. Bamboo is a ubiquitous plant in Bali so it was important for us to incorporate it into our designs and we did, you can see the Hijau (meaning ""green"" in Balinese) collection showcases the look of sliced bamboo. This year we are proud to launch Hijau Dua, our second collaboration.What were some of the biggest challenges and surprises that came up in the process?More From Harper's BAZAARDesigning the jewelry was exciting and challenging all at once.  One can never know how meticulous the design process is until they witness it firsthand.  First comes the sketch, then the mold is created and then the piece is cast; in the case of Hijau Dua in recycled sterling silver or 18K gold.  I was so impressed by the attention to detail Guy and his artisans pay to each and every piece of handcrafted jewelry.As someone who's previously been on the other side of the coin, what was it like designing pieces as opposed to modeling them?While I do love my work, I've always felt quite comfortable on the ""other side.""  I feel a great sense of accomplishment when I've worked hard to create something and see it come to life.What was your favorite aspect of your trip to Bali?The Balinese people are truly amazing.  They have such a commitment to nature and their surroundings.  It really blew me away to see how they take such pride in their work and utilizing everything the earth provides.We know you've been an eco-activist for some time. What do you hope will result from this collaboration, in terms of raising awareness about the environment?Yes, I have been committed to this for several years now and I think the best thing we can do to create true awareness is to educate. I even started my own foundation, Collage, a non-profit that tackles environmental and social issues through various partnerships and events. My collaboration with John Hardy is meant to inspire people everywhere to see that each and every one of us can make a difference in our own way.  For this collection, we are donating a portion of sales to John Hardy's ""Wear Bamboo, Plant Bamboo"" program, which plants a number of bamboo seedlings for every piece of jewelry sold.This content is imported from youTube.

Claude Home and Mejuri Created the Actual Chicest Jewelry Holders,"Designers take different paths to find inspiration, but three brands took a similar psychedelic journey to colorful chevron prints for Spring. Tommy Hilfiger is back to his original color palette of red, white and blue to offer bathing suits and shirt dresses in an elegant, patriotically shaded zig zag print. Band of Outsiders, inspired by the Japanese dyeing techniques of shibori, took a more relaxed and wavy approach to the magic eye version of herringbone. Meanwhile, designers Alan Eckstein and Timo Weiland, inspired by graffiti artist Keith Harring, showed halter dresses and short blazers in a pink and red take on the playful pattern."

The 27 Best Closet and Jewelry Organizers for Decluttering Your Space,"Gaydamak's sparkling but tough, futuristic yet intricately wrought fine jewelry pieces feel like they're changing the game.Parisian sisters Sonia and Katia Gaydamak launched the brand in 2009 with an emphasis on the hand bracelet and have found a strong editorial footing, fans with means and count ladies like Natalia Vadianova amongst devotees. The sisters have the clout to match their unqiue aesthetic — both graduated from the New York Gemological Institute of America. BAZAAR spoke with the pair who split their time between London and Paris about making the ancient current and their signature piece.Harper's Bazaar: The pieces are beautiful but also feel innovative, what was your starting point for launching Gaydamak?Soni Gaydamak: It began with a desire to want to do something together. Our love for stones and passion for gemology made us look into that direction. We grew up in a house where most of the objects weren't used in a traditional or conventional way, so it made sense that our jewelry would follow the same destiny.More From Harper's BAZAARHB: What are the places/items that are inspiring you now?Katia Gaydamak: We have a fabulous collection of books on ancient fabrics. We like to reinterpret the ancient. But also the people we have met over the last few months, such as Zaha Hadid, have left a indelible mark on our collection to come.Media Platforms Design TeamHB: The hand bracelet is obviously the star, where did the idea come from? SG: Since we started, we wanted to add a signature piece to our name, but nothing really special came to mind. Katia was wearing a traditional bracelet that was too big, it fell on to her palm towards her fingers and that was it! It took a year for the development of the project and another year to get into the right retaillers over Europe and the US.HB: You are both certified gemologists, how has that helped your roles as designers specifically? SG: We like to chose the stones, gold and setters ourself. We travel to Asia, Israel or New York if we know we will find a special gem. But what is most important for us, is to find harmony between our sketches and the ultimate result.HB: What is your design process like? KG: Our mood boards are the most important moment in the creation of a new piece. We like to be overwelmed with ideas and then select what will be in the final product. ""Creativity is a full time job"" and not a moment. We like to sit and brain storm through various images, books and memories.HB: Who would you live to see wear Gaydamak?KG: In all fairness, we like the woman who thinks outside the box. A woman who feels free and strong yet feminine and sexy.HB: How would you describe the aesthetic of the brand? SG: Just like the woman that wears it — free. HB: What is it like being in business with your sister? How do you work together?SG: We initially wanted to seperate the tasks but as time went by we realized that we needed each other's input on all matters.KG: Officially Sonia is in charge of the development and me of design. But in reality, we can't be seperated for more than an hour!Kerry PieriDigital Fashion/Features DirectorKerry Pieri is Harper's Bazaar's Digital Fashion/Features Director.

9 Micro Trends from New York Fashion Week,"We don't want to be so pedestrian as to call out a color of the season, but when there's a hue as rich and, let's face it, pretty, as a deep emerald green showing up all over the runway, we would be remiss not to mention it. Jason Wu took his green to military inspired places, while Peter Som's peplum dress erred more on the side of ladylike. Securing its place in a three-way trend, Yigal Azrouel used green in leather suiting for the cool girl. We also just saw some lovely gowns in the jewel tone at Wes Gordon as well, which is leading us to believe this micro-trend may progress to mass trend by week's end.Kerry PieriDigital Fashion/Features DirectorKerry Pieri is Harper's Bazaar's Digital Fashion/Features Director.

The Best Nail Trends for Spring 2022,"It sounds macabre when you say it, but looks very chic — if not a touch gothic — when you see it. We're referring to the growing ubiquity of ox blood on the Fall 2012 runways. We've concentrated on the use of the saturated hue on outwear, as seen at Alexander Wang, Tommy Hilfiger and Helmut Lang. The deeper shade of crimson is surprisingly versatile and can act as a neutral or an unexpected, rich alternative to black. Perhaps this trend is a residual affect of that never-ending pop culture obsession with all things vampiric.

16 Pieces of Jewelry That Make Excellent Gifts,"Usually, when Phoebe Bridgers talks about the moon, she's singing to a group of crying fans (I am, admittedly, one of them) who are mouthing the words to her ""Moon Song."" But last week, she could be found talking about astronomy in a not-heart-wrenching context—while wearing Chanel jewelry inspired by the stars. Standing underneath a crescent moon on a stage in Los Angeles, she introduced the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who were performing for Chanel’s guests at a dinner celebrating the launch of the 1932 jewelry collection, which is the second one ever released by the brand. The crowd cheered, but the 18-karat Coco Crush earrings and bracelet adorning Bridgers’s earlobes and wrist were beautiful enough that they could have elicited tears (of jealousy). Phoebe Bridgers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinIt has been 90 years since Gabrielle Chanel designed Bijoux de Diamants, the first high jewelry collection in history. It was created three years after Black Thursday pushed the world into the Great Depression, and Chanel was determined to create something that could shine through the turmoil. The 50-piece collection was made of white and yellow diamonds set in platinum and yellow gold, with 22 pieces inspired by specific constellations. “Nothing could be better for forgetting the crisis than feasting one’s eyes on beautiful new things,” she said of the collection. And so it feels fitting that in 2022, nearly three years after the entire world stood still for the pandemic, the fashion house she built would respond to our somber times with something just as sumptuous.More From Harper's BAZAARThe Yeah Yeah Yeahs performing at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinLike the original Bijoux de Diamants collection, the design of 1932 is harmonized around three symbols: the comet, the moon, and the sun. Chanel muses like Marion Cotillard, Lori Harvey, Greta Lee, and Whitney Peak were in attendance at the West Hollywood celebration, and, like Bridgers, were also layered in pieces from the 1932 collection named after the cosmos. Maggie Rogers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection. Pat MartinSinger Maggie Rogers, who also recently graduated from Harvard’s Divinity School, wore five rings from the collection but said the shooting star Comète ear cuff in 18-karat gold was her favorite. On the Chanel black carpet, Rogers mentioned how she felt a kinship with Gabrielle over her affinity for outer space: “[The cosmos] is something that has always resonated with me and is very apparent and present in my musical work.” Gossip Girl’s Whitney Peak said the collection made her feel like a “superstar” before joking, “I feel like I shouldn’t be wearing it. I don’t know how they let me get away with this!” and then grasping the 1932 Comète Couture necklace in 18-karat gold and diamonds around her neck. Whitney Peak at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinWhile there are 77 pieces in the collection, its signature piece is the Allure Céleste necklace, with round-cut diamonds, an oval sapphire of deep blue, and a weight of 55.5 carats. What makes it extraordinary is its ability to transform: The halos detach to become brooches, and the central row of diamonds becomes a bracelet, converting the necklace into a shorter version. Thirteen other pieces from the 1932 collection also have the ability to transform in a similar manner, allowing the wearer to make new diamond constellations around their wrists and necks.Guests dining at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinMany of the pieces were made without clasps, something Gabrielle Chanel openly disliked. “I detest clasps! I’ve done away with clasps! Yet my jewelry is transformable,” she said in an interview in 1932 after the “Bijoux de Diamants” exhibition. She strived to design pieces that offered flexibility to busy women with full lives, and that didn’t impede their freedom. And as the jewelry-spangled guests left their cares behind to dance under a canopy of baby’s breath, it was evident that the new 1932 collection stays true to her vision.Tara GonzalezTara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.

The 6 Biggest Hat Trends of The Season,"Prada has never done things by the book. The brand has been creating the world's most desirable fashion pieces since their start over one hundred years ago, going from making humble leather goods to being one of the biggest privately owned brands in the world. Now, the brand is expanding on their aesthetic universe with a daring introduction into fine jewelry. The inaugural collection, titled ETERNAL GOLD, marks both a commitment to beauty and to sustainable, circular fashion.Maya Hawke for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsAs Prada's first-ever fine jewelry offering, ETERNAL GOLD is a first in many aspects. It's also the world's first fine jewelry collection made entirely with recycled gold, collected using the industry's most rigorous standards set by the Responsible Jewelry Council. Prada is also the first company to expand on diamond traceability, making every single carat count traceable down to its origins. The complete transparency of every material used in their jewelry, from sourcing to cutting to setting, is a radical step in the direction of honest production for an otherwise murky process. Somi Jeon for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsThe jewelry is a reflection of Prada's impact on the industry and a continuation of their efforts to creating beautiful objects that stands the test of time, as all fine jewelry should. ETERNAL GOLD is rife with Pradaisms, with the instantly recognizable Prada triangle rendered as sleek earrings and pendants, but also imbued in clasp closures, and more subtly, in chain links and as the head and tail of the snake bracelet.  The snake bracelet itself may at first recall other serpent bracelets, but finds its own voice with the sneaky Prada triangle and smooth, unvarnished gold. Heart pendants take on an edgy effect with the triangle chainlink it sits on.More From Harper's BAZAARCourtesyCourtesyPrada chose three voices of our time to don this foundational collection, representing where Prada is now and where it can go. Amanda Gorman, award-winning poet and activist, Maya Hawke, singer/songwriter, actress, and model, and Somi Jeon, musician, become one with the gold, immortalized in gold negative renderings by David Sims. The jewelry and its campaign represent the future of a wholly responsible planet that isn't sacrificing purity and beauty at its demise.

She finished the look with the black Adidas sneakers every model seems to be wearing, a green handbag, and brown oval sunglasses.Gerber wore no makeup and kept her straight her down for the outing.BACKGRIDWhen she's not looking glamorous on the Cannes Film Festival red carpet with boyfriend Austin Butler, Gerber is showing off her relaxed model-off-duty style on low-key dates.For a screening of Elvis in New York City this June, Gerber looked casual but chic in a navy top, black miniskirt, and matching leather blazer. She finished the look with a pair of high socks and white sneakers, and accessorized with her green shoulder bag and black Ray-Ban sunglasses. And on a lunch date with Butler this August, the model wore an open cobalt blue button-down over a cropped tank in the same hue, relaxed black trousers, and her go-to black Adidas sneakers. She accessorized with the same oval sunglasses and green handbag she carried yesterday, along with diamond stud earrings.This week, the stylish star released her own collection of wardrobe essentials with Zara (available to shop since October 4).

5 Micro Trends You'll Want to Wear STAT,"Is any woman as synonymous with another creature as Mariah Carey is with a butterfly?This week, the singer celebrated the 30th anniversary of the release of her groundbreaking album Butterfly, and now she celebrates the arrival of her collaboration with the jeweler Chopard, which launches in stores and online today, September 16. The pieces, a mix of butterflies rendered in diamonds on rings, bracelets, earrings, and a breathtaking statement necklace, commemorate Carey’s  longtime affinity for the creature who helped her conceptualize her life as an independent artist at the top of a male-dominated music industry. She describes the process of seeing and wearing the pieces, while simultaneously celebrating “my favorite album that I’ve done,” as an emotional experience. “It’s a major moment, and it’s a full circle moment,” she says. Here she tells us about conceptualizing the collection, her daily jewelry wardrobe, and how she will wear the pieces.Harper’s Bazaar: I want to start by talking about this incredible butterfly necklace. Mariah Carey: Oh my gosh.HB: The butterfly, of course, is this incredibly significant symbol of transformation for you. But seeing the butterfly rendered in diamonds reminded me of how dazzling they are. They’re the most beautiful living creatures. And I wondered if you learned anything about the butterfly, seeing it rendered in diamonds. The enduring symbol of the butterfly—I mean, we can go on and on about different people's interpretations and feelings. My own personal feelings are so very specific to my album Butterfly and that period of my life, which we are celebrating the anniversary of this year, [coincidentally] at the same time that this is all happening, right? Because we've been working on this [with Chopard] for two years together, and it happened by accident [that] we’re re-releasing the Butterfly album, which is my favorite album that I’ve done.And yes, I have a very specific relationship with the butterfly and just the whole metamorphosis of it. The way that I had to come through a very difficult time in my life and, you know, like they say, you’ve gotta go through something to get something. I had to get to that place where I felt empowered enough to metaphorically fly and be free from that place where I was. I started out in this industry as such a young girl in a really difficult world, dominated by men. I wrote this song as I was leaving this mansion that I had paid for half of, and [where] I had sort of created my own little prison, not really deliberately, but it ended up feeling that way. And I was leaving and I wrote the lyrics and the melody to [the song “Butterfly”]: Spread your wings and prepare to fly / for you have become a butterfly. And so that’s always stuck with me. I’ve made many albums since then, but it’s just very specific to me. So to see this magnificent butterfly necklace, and the ring—I mean, it was so much to even be able to say, I collaborated on this. To be able to admire the craft—I don’t want to say “craftsmanship.” Please give me another word.HB: The creation, the artistry?The artistry! That’s what it is. Just to be able to collaborate with Chopard and doing this collection is a humongous honor. I’m just here, ready to put some diamonds on and hang out. Whatever! Courtesy of Chopard.HB: What is your daily jewelry wardrobe? Are we wearing the butterfly ring every day and the necklace for special occasions? Or is there a different routine here?I am not really one for routines of any sort. I’m not a dancer. I don’t really like to follow rules. So I would wear any piece on any occasion. But right now i’m wearing a bracelet that my daughter made for me that says “Lamily” on it, which is an homage to my fans made of little beads and elastic, with some diamond bracelets. I would wear any piece from the collection in a casual moment, or more specifically the Happy Butterfly collection, which I love so much. I think they’re gonna look gorgeous stacked with even just a T-shirt and jeans, leggings, a simple dress. There’s just really great pieces that are attainable, as well as those gorgeous—I don’t find them over the top, some might say they are; they’re major—pieces that I live for.They are really major. And they feel so you. I can see you wearing this incredible butterfly necklace with a T-shirt, or these enormous leaf earrings.I would do that! I’m so ready to wear those. When Caroline [Scheufele, the president of Chopard] was evolving and creating them, she was explaining them to me and I knew exactly what she meant, but when I saw them, I was losing it. I mean, they’re just sick. It’s beyond. They’re so good. [Laughs.]Sounds like you and Caroline had good chemistry.I feel like Caroline probably has incredible chemistry with anyone cuz she’s so fun and carefree. I love that about her. She’s also an artist and a businesswoman, and to work with her to make this collection together, [it feels] even more extra special because it was my idea and I was able to watch it happen.Courtesy of Chopard.Would you say it’s true that diamonds are a girl’s best friend?Well, considering the people I know, for sure. Maybe the exception of one or two. You know, at the end of the day, they’re not going to steer you wrong! Do you feel like jewelry plays an important part in your life spiritually? It can be armor, but it also reflects the essential feminine aspects of who you are.That’s interesting. I’ve never thought of it that way. There were little things, little pieces that I’ve had throughout my life, where they did have their own—I wouldn’t say spiritual, but they had a sort of special significance to me where I would keep them on no matter what. Swimming, whatever I was doing, I would keep them on. Because they were that special to me. And at one point I lost a piece of jewelry that I loved so much, and it wasn’t even that it was a major thing. It just meant something to me. But with this collection, everything means so much to me that I’m just excited to share it with the world.

Shop Y2K-Inspired Jewelry Pieces That Are More Than Just Nostalgic,"Katie Holmes's classic street style has set its sights on the pants trend du jour: low-rise jeans. Yesterday, the Dawson's Creek alum was spotted out and about in New York City running errands while wearing an effortlessly stylish look. Her breezy, late-summer ensemble consisted of a blush pink spaghetti-strap cami tucked into a pair of baggy low-rise jeans in a light wash. She continued the minimalist approach with the rest of her outfit, wearing olive green flip-flops and carrying a maroon shoulder bag from A.P.C., eschewing jewelry entirely.BACKGRIDBaggy pants have made cameos in Holmes's street style before.Earlier this month, she made a cozy appearance in the city, accompanied by boyfriend Bobby Wooten III, while wearing an oversized slouchy pair of black trousers. She paired the statement pants with a classic light gray knit sweater with a red-and-cream pattern across the chest and shoulders, and finished the look with a brown leather cross-body bag.Back in June, the actress talked to BAZAAR.com about curating her sense of style, both on and off set.""I directed two films back-to-back this year, and I did the costumes as well, which made me appreciate my friends who are costume designers and all the costume designers I've worked with in the past,"" Holmes said of her work on Rare Objects and a still-untitled romance movie based in Connecticut. ""It made me appreciate silhouettes and cuts and color in a way I thought I had, but when you put it on camera, when you are trying to tell a story, you can see how clothing can do a lot of the work for you.""Of her personal wardrobe, she added, ""I love my T-shirts, and I love my vintage T-shirts.

Luxury Brand ManLuu Is a Striking Tribute to Creole Jewelry Traditions,"Worn by celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, Kendall Jenner, Tracee Ellis Ross, Millie Bobby Brown, and more, the '90s- and Y2K-inspired braided tendril trend has only increased in popularity since its reemergence during the 2022 festival season. ""The tendril trend has always been an easy way to add a little 'razzle-dazzle' to any updo,"" Erinn Courtney, a natural hair expert at StyleSeat and celebrity stylist, tells BAZAAR.com. Typically crafted as a set of smaller, face-framing braids, braided tendrils are an easy way to elevate a go-to bun or ponytail. You can also quickly enhance a salon-quality blowout or beachy waves by adding a second pair of braids near the ears for a summery, carefree hair look.View full post on InstagramView full post on InstagramWhen it comes to the styling essentials needed for a braided tendril updo versus wearing your hair completely down, professionals say there isn't much difference in the products and tools to keep in your arsenal. ""Re-creating this look at home is pretty simple,"" says celebrity stylist and Mane Addicts artist Irinel de León, who counts stars like Bella Hadid, Chrissy Teigen, and Hailey Bieber as clients.

""I also recommend applying gel around the perimeter of the hair, brushing it upwards, then securing it with a hair tie.

Are Beaded Phone Straps the Accessory of the Summer?,"Ahead of the premiere of her much-awaited film Blonde, in which she portrays Marilyn Monroe, Ana de Armas is diving into a world Monroe knew quite a lot about: diamonds.The film and fashion icon famously sang ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" in the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and was known for her elegant style and love of high jewelry (remember when she wore the spectacular yellow diamond necklace dubbed The Moon of Baroda?). At the time, however, the diamond industry was seen as untouchable and unreachable for both ordinary buyers and small jewelry designers, and only big names, such as De Beers and Tiffany & Co., got the business and the notoriety. At the same time, conflict diamonds and diamond smuggling became real problems.Now, the Natural Diamond Council, along with brand ambassador de Armas, is looking to change that by backing young designers from around the world and educating buyers on the current state of the industry, which is moving toward a more sustainable and inclusive future.More From Harper's BAZAAR""I started working with the NDC in 2020, and I think it was a process for me of learning,"" de Armas tells BAZAAR.com at the NDC's launch event on June 14 at the Beekman Hotel penthouse in New York City, adding that she got to see how women in Botswana ran diamond mines and handled tractors, and essentially got to know the community behind the precious stones.    Vincenzo DiminoOn Tuesday, the NDC debuted the collections of the second class of artists from its Emerging Designers Diamond Initiative, which launched in January 2021 with $1 million of diamond credit dedicated to supporting emerging BIPOC jewelry designers, in partnership with Lorraine Schwartz.Per the NDC, ""The diamond industry is historically a generational and handshake industry where emerging designers without prior connections often experience barriers to entry. The program sets to level the playing field by providing direct, career-lasting relationships with diamantaires by underwriting $1 million in diamond credit in the designers’ own names. Industry education and resources, mentor pairings, and financial support for production and CAD designs are NDC’s efforts to help create a more equitable future.""Vincenzo DiminoDe Armas, wearing a brilliant ring and necklace from Dorian Webb and a ring from Heart the Stones by Halle Millien, says it's powerful the way in which the NDC is supporting—and financially backing—artists in the community who need the space to simply do what they're good at.""As a minority myself, I remember the days when I just wanted the chance to be in the room. I wanted to just be there. Give me the opportunity and I'll show you what I can offer,"" de Armas says. ""The fact that they're mentoring and supporting and opening the doors to relationships and careers and resources for these guys and giving them the credit is incredible.""The Cuban actress is no stranger to red-carpet glamour, and she has been dripped in diamonds for roles several times over the course of her film career, but she says the passion and originality of the up-and-coming jewelry designers' diamond pieces prove there are still ways to break boundaries in the diamond world.""It's the new generations who are going to bring a new take on jewelry. We don't have to keep wearing or interpreting jewelry in the same way,"" she says.Vincenzo DiminoJewelry, and diamonds in particular, the actress agrees, can be incredibly personal. They can be much more than just beautiful, high-priced pieces we like to look at. A jewelry collection can be passed down for generations, it can carry different meanings and morph and be modernized through the years—take Duchess Kate's inherited jewelry from Princess Diana, for example.De Armas says there is one piece she bought herself that she cherishes above all others: an antique ring that reminds her of her grandmother.""I had a ring from my grandma that I'm pretty sure was not a diamond, but it was this dark red stone with little things around it, and I lost it at the airport and I was so, so, so, so sad,"" she recalls in a conversation with BAZAAR. ""And years went by, and then I was shooting a movie and we were shooting on the street and I bumped into an antique store and I found the version of that ring—same color, but this time real diamonds—and I had to get it. It wasn't my grandma's ring, but it just reminds me of her. I have it here, actually, because I always wear it."" Maybe not as meaningful but equally dazzling were the jewels de Armas got to wear while filming the 2021 James Bond film No Time to Die with Daniel Craig.""That was beautiful—such an incredible touch for the character. Everything was so simple but I just felt like the jewelry really matched her personality: so sparkly and shiny and happy,"" de Armas says.Vincenzo DiminoWalking around the NDC event, where the young designers showcased their diamond creations, the actress couldn't keep her eyes off Birthright Foundry's Heritage Diamond Ula Nifo choker, crafted from 18-karat yellow gold and natural white diamonds but inspired by whale tooth necklaces from Samoa. The Ula Nifo necklace was worn by Samoan chiefs and their children in ancient times, and signified wealth and status, designer Constance Polamalu explains.""It's just so different,"" de Armas says.Grant Mobley, a diamond and fine jewelry expert at the NDC, tells BAZAAR how rare and exciting it is to see a high-jewelry piece so influenced by a designer's underrepresented culture, and yet so wearable today.""If you think back to these incredible Samoan jewelry designs with the amazing necklace collars from well over 100 years ago, she's turning that into something that makes sense for the modern day, and she's also doing that with fine jewelry materials: gold, diamonds,"" he says. ""It's something that might've been worn hundreds of years ago by her ancestors, but she's making it something that she would wear and that you would see on the red carpet.""The collections of the latest EDDI class of designers—Casey Perez, Corey Anthony Jones, Lana Ogilvie (Sabre Jewelry), Mckenzie Liautaud, Halle Millien (Heart the Stones), and Ruben Manuel—will launch this Friday, June 17, on 1stDibs.

The Coolest Nail Trends For 2021,"Storing your jewelry can be an afterthought to wearing your jewelry. But your pendants and cocktail rings are still on display to you, in your home, when you're not wearing them.

The Coolest Summer 2021 Nail Art Trends,"Lately I wonder if we’re living through a mass psychosis expressing itself through trend reporting. If it felt a year ago like anything goes—that the restrictions and trauma of the pandemic highlighted fashion and self-expression as a new outlet for freedom—increasingly it seems that there are a thousand trends happening at once. In just the past month, I have read stories about a new twist on the girlboss trend called “that girl,” a trend in which women really enjoy themselves, and a trend in which women enjoy themselves a little, plus “dinocore,” “clowncore,” and “twee.” On TikTok, trend forecasting has become the new influencer hustle, almost a trend itself; creators who can string together photographic evidence with a pithy and compelling monologue are performing a kind of competitive prophecy. And the platform’s algorithm seems to favor this sort of information sharing: the more ridiculous the prediction, the more traction it gains, and the more predictions we are fed. In the meantime, fast fashion brands like Shein have sped production to such a pace that they can both predict and reflect these trends, making them feel all the more real while we ping pong through “feels” and “vibes” with no aesthetic compass. Even runway fashion, which is supposed to move at a slower, biannual speed, has joined this rat race, as designers pack their shows with potential viral moments and styles that are replicable by anyone with a little ingenuity and a pair of scissors. The tempo of fashion makes everything feel quick, carefree, and, sometimes, unfortunately, even careless. Mostly it seems that people are doing things humans have done for most of the past century—relaxing, working hard, having martinis, not having martinis—but now we cannot resist the urge to package them into something that feels more meaningful than mere consumer choices.Jerry Lorenzo, the 44-year-old designer behind the brand Fear of God, is a man who has started many trends himself (real trends, that is). When he began his brand almost a decade ago, it was a luxury cornerstone of the hypebeast movement, which often encourages a cut-throat, product-driven style of consumerism. Lorenzo worked on an early season of Yeezy alongside then-Vetements designer Demna, and, after making T-shirts for Justin Bieber’s “Purpose” tour, helped turn merch into meaningful clothes. He was a close friend of and collaborator with the late Virgil Abloh, whose brand Off-White propelled streetwear to the forefront of fashion, and his sneakers and sweatpants remain staples in hip corridors of Los Angeles and New York. But lately, Lorenzo has been on a different kind of fashion journey. In early 2020 he collaborated with Ermenegildo Zegna’s Alessandro Sartori for a collection that shifted menswear’s inner circle’s attitude around suiting, making it feel less performative and more like a staple. And now his collections, which arrive on his own time rather than seasonally, serve a slower, even higher purpose. Today, he is releasing a new collection, his first in nearly two years. As he worked on it, he said in a video interview late last week, he asked himself of every garment, “Is this timeless?”“I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now,” he said. “And I want to provide a safe space for someone that wants to step outside of that, but can still step into that conversation with everyone else that’s of ‘the now’ and feel of ‘the now,’ but not have to be so on trend.” Instead, what he wants his clothing to do is help his customers “feel the confidence. I want them to feel sophisticated, but I want them to feel the freedom to be themselves and know that it’s not the trend that validates you. It’s the individual that you are.” Lorenzo calls this collection Eternal. And while the clothing is a natural progression of the easy elegance of the collections he dropped in late summer and fall of 2020, it seems quite radical, to me, to proclaim you want to defy the trend cycle and try to make something that has lasting value. It seems so obvious, to try to float above it all, and yet the intoxicating quest for relevance has made it a rare impulse. Lorenzo is almost dipping into the realm of slow fashion—of designers with far less recognizable names who rarely stage fashion shows, like the 19th-century inspired work of Paul Harnden, the simple French cottons of Casey Casey, or the heady beauty of Elena Dawson. They make clothing that is intentionally hard to find and difficult to make. Lorenzo hasn’t gone that far, of course, and he has in his corner the fact that his clothing is meant to make you feel as comfortable in a suit as you are in your favorite sweatshirt. That means it has the potential to transcend the cognoscenti customer of slow fashion brands, or perhaps convert recovering hypebeasts into cognoscenti. He is designing with incredible thoughtfulness, even integrity–almost like a novel. “I approach it like a book or a music album,” said Lorenzo of putting together collections. “I don't really approach it in terms of seasons and seasonality. I approach it like, Hey, do I have something to say? Do I have the resources to say what I wanna say in the best way?” He remains independently owned–he also has a partnership with Adidas, where he serves as the head of strategy for their basketball category—and his resources are just catching up to his point of view, as he put it. He’s been able to move 80% of his production to Italy, for example. “And so hopefully each time we have something to say, it’s better than the last thing we said.” Lorenzo, of course, isn’t the only designer to prize continual improvement over novelty. The Row’s Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen come to mind, and Lorenzo, like The Row and other influential American aesthetes, is particularly drawn, lately, to the 1980s and ’90s designs of Giorgio Armani. His cascades of beige in flowing, almost spiritually understated cuts wrote a new script for minimalism. If Prada was cerebral, edgy, and obscure, and Calvin Klein was sexy, Armani was, just as Lorenzo said, a man of confidence, whose clothing blessed its wearers with a feeling of monastic chic weightlessness. “I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now.”In Eternal, the cuts are generous without swamping their wearer in fabric; the tones are bones, milky beiges, and greyish whites; and nearly all the pants blur the line between a structured trouser and a cozy sweatpant. You can see how a person dressed in these clothes might calm a room of investors or subtly change the energy in a coffee shop line. “I am in fashion, and I do love to present myself a certain way,” Lorenzo mused. “But that’s always been something that is understated. It’s always been something that isn’t loud and doesn’t call for attention. As quiet as I want to be in a room, I also want to be competent, you know?” Like Armani—and again, like The Row—Lorenzo is thinking about how his clothing might provide solutions, not only to the holes in your wardrobe but to your own questions about your sense of self. How do you wear a suit, which has different proportions and fabrics than a hoodie or track pants, and still feel like yourself? “That’s what I’m always chasing, you know? How can I be always sophisticated in the way that I present myself, but honest, and relaxed and comfortable?” Lorenzo’s evolution as a designer over the past decade, from a Los Angeles DJ to a new hero in intentional clothing creation, has been one of fashion’s most interesting. By staying independent, he’s allowed himself the time to grow and explore that investors or big luxury house appointments rarely afford. Too often, a designer’s references are too readily apparent, too surface—Ralph Lauren’s Polo line, or Annie Leibowitz’s images for The Gap, or the wackadoo spirit of 1980s couture that seems to have captured the imagination of many young womenswear designers in New York. In fact, prior to his dalliance with Zegna, Lorenzo spoke about wanting to build a brand like Lauren’s. But Lorenzo has a new modesty about him, and his clothing feels intimate in a way that Lauren’s, which is much more like a worshipful encyclopedia of American style, simply cannot. We talked about how opting out of trendiness can be quite boring—depending on how many viscose trouser-wearing influencers you follow on Instagram, you might say it’s even something of a trend itself—and how he’s tweaked his pieces, and played with fabrics, to give his pieces some heart and some personality. Changing the shoulder on a jacket from a past collection to make it feel less 1980s, for example. The result is that these are real clothes, for someone who is not trying to create a look for a moment in time, but who believes fashion can improve your life in small but significant ways.Open GalleryRachel TashjianRachel Tashjian is the Fashion News Director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.

Those contents were personal, private and not matters of legitimate public interest.""Speaking out after her win, Duchess Meghan called the double court win ""a victory not just for me, but for anyone who has ever felt scared to stand up for what’s right."" Alongside a subtle mention of the tabloids often-used nickname on social media, she added, ""The courts have held the defendant to account, and my hope is that we all begin to do the same.

11 Trends That Will Get You Shopping for Spring 2019,"No one does glamour quite like Anya Taylor-Joy. So, to no one's surprise, The Queen's Gambit star looked incredible at the 73rd annual Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles last night. For television's biggest night, the burgeoning star—styled by Paul Burgo—wore a pale-yellow, backless, vintage-inspired Dior Haute Couture halter gown and about $800,000 worth of dazzling diamond jewelry courtesy of Tiffany & Co. Tiffany and Co. Tiffany and Co.Taylor-Joy's gown for the evening was embellished with two of the luxury jeweler's Elsa Peretti Diamonds by the Yard platinum necklaces elegantly draped down the actress's back— a mesmerizing look that was inspired by classic movie stars from Old Hollywood's past. She also wore platinum diamond starburst earrings, a yellow sapphire and baguette diamond bracelet from the brand's Blue Book Collection, and two major statement rings: an over-17-carat yellow sapphire diamond and a stunning platinum vine-shaped ring.  Tiffany and Co.Tiffany and Co.The actress's breathtaking beauty look for the night was equally dramatic, with Taylor Joy opting for a matte complexion, flushed cheeks, neutral eye shadow, wispy lashes, and vibrant red lips. She wore her hair in a vintage-inspired, delicately styled bouffant, but added a modern, kitschy touch with a bright-yellow manicure as well.

Jewelry Designer Pamela Love on Finding Great Vintage Pieces,"MoAna Luu has spent her professional life building brands, from designing boutique hotels to serving as chief content and creative officer at Essence. But after contracting Covid-19 in March 2020, Luu decided to refocus on a new brand-building effort—one that’s entirely her own. That project is ManLuu, a line of luxury jewelry paying homage to Luu’s Creole heritage—a blend of African, Indian, French, and Caribbean traditions—and Martinique’s long tradition of jewelry-making. ManLuu arrives today at Nordstrom for its official, 21-item debut following a soft online launch this summer. ManLuu is composed of gender neutral earrings, bracelets, and rings in 18k gold vermeil and sterling silver. Nods to Creole jewelry tradition emerge through ManLuu’s use of exaggerated geometric shapes and signature woven patterns (an octagonal hoop with webbed inlays here, a chunky beaded bracelet there). ""The craftsmanship is something that is so delicate, when you see it you know you have a precious piece already,"" Luu says.More From Harper's BAZAARSome of the designer's earliest introductions to Creole craftsmanship came from her grandparents’ jewelry store in Fort-de-France, Martinique, Luu tells BAZAAR.com. But ManLuu’s devotion to quality is inspired by even earlier references, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. At that time, Black people could not become property owners, so they invested in gold jewelry heirlooms to pass down among generations. Luu says that ManLuu shares the power of this story, one that many people may not know, through each piece.MoAna Luu at the ManLuu atelier in New York City.ManLuuManLuu’s interpretation of heirloom jewelry had resonated long before this week’s Nordstrom launch. Gwyneth Paltrow, Mary J. Blige, and Maye Musk are a few of its early fans. Cardi B. even wore ManLuu bangles to announce her second pregnancy earlier this year—a special stamp of approval for the brand, Luu tells us. Joining forces with a large retailer like Nordstrom is, in some ways, even more significant than those celebrity endorsements. ""As a Black female designer and founder, I believe it's important that heritage brands welcome new creators and support them taking their place in the luxury market,"" Luu explains. ""This is a big step, not just for me, but for all of us.""While ManLuu's approach to luxury references centuries-old jewelry traditions, its use of eco-friendly materials is thoroughly 2021. Many pieces are crafted with recycled metals; later on, ManLuu will also incorporate lab-grown diamonds. Luu couldn't imagine starting a new label without incorporating conscious design techniques: “Sustainability is something that, today, is mandatory in any business."" By balancing meaningful history with modern design, ManLuu is an alternative to the throwaway jewelry sold, well, nearly everywhere. “Fast fashion was nice,” Luu says, “but now it’s time for pieces you want to keep.” And one day, pass down.Shop Manluu at NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$770 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Classic Beaded Necklace$2,650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Open Ring$600 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Cuff Bracelet$2,800 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$370 at NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$900 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Ear Jackets$1,000 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$570 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Embossed Ring$650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Long Beaded Necklace$4,200 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$470 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$1,100 at NordstromCredit: NordstromHalie LeSavageHalie LeSavage is the fashion commerce editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, where she covers everything from emerging designers to viral products to must-shop sales events.

The Biggest Decor Trends the Year You Were Born,"No one can take a time-out from the Y2K fashion revival. Not even our iPhones. Like bucket hats and platform flip flops before them, phone straps of the early aughts variety are having a renaissance. Think of these attachable lanyards like the camp jewelry trend, but for your phone. The plainest phone straps start with rainbow-colored resin beads and get kitschier from there. Entire indie brands are dedicated to beaded phone straps, with String Ting, GriGri, and Hang On credited in mirror selfies across Instagram. Established accessories players are catching on, with versions appearing at Roxanne Assoulin and Lele Sadoughi. View full post on InstagramAlex Bass, founder at phone strap seller Hang On, says Y2K nostalgia is a big part of her brand. Hang On’s aesthetic harkens back to the days when cell phones were a novelty and personalizing them was a compulsion—the more glitter, the better. In Bass’s case, she stuck “stickers and rhinestones on every square centimeter of the phone, à la Carrie Bradshaw.”More From Harper's BAZAARBut there’s more to the phone strap trend than 2000 calling to give our lucky charms back,  String Ting founder Rachel Steed-Middleton tells BAZAAR.com. “The ‘smartphone-is-my-life’ way of being is more current and of the times, so this is really a very new and modern-day category of accessorizing,” she says.

Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, and Kaia Gerber have all been spotted with String Tings dangling from their phones.“Being more connected to our devices naturally makes us think about what they look like and how we can personalize them,” Bass agrees. “With Hang On, we’ve tried to capitalize on this trend but also reshape its narrative.” The brand offers two-for-one discounts on its charms—to encourage shoppers to buy one for a friend, and remind them to stay in touch.

The Best Winter Hair Trends for 2019,"Thanks to an early passion for vintage fashion, jewelry designer Pamela Love knows her way around sartorial classics. For her, shopping isn't just about finding things that are aesthetically pleasing; instead, she looks for elegant pieces with eye-catching details and rich backstories. ""Finding a great vintage item is like winning the lottery. It's completely unique and special and has a story behind it,"" she says. Here, Love takes us on a vintage shopping excursion at Brooklyn's Amarcord, explaining what she's always hunting for and why clothing can sometimes take a backseat to stunning jewelry.From: ELLE US"
"This Jewelry Was Inspired by Suprematism, See Why","Katie Kova is petite, quietly spoken, and very chic (think simple, understated style that conveys a quiet sort of elegance). Her newly launched fine jewelry label, Kova, follows in much the same vein. ""My jewelry is 100% wearable, stackable, mixable, and day-to-night viable,"" she says. ""I wear it with a T-shirt and flats and with a cocktail dress and stilettos.""Inspired by the 20th-century Russian art movement Suprematism (invented by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich, it was one of the earliest and most radical developments in abstract art), Kova's pieces possess the same sort of graphic, linear construction and minimalist feel as her favorite artworks. An ear cuff features circles and zig zag lines embedded with dozens of black and white pave diamonds, while a pair of triangular earrings have slight differences in each side. ""At Kova we see jewelry as a form of wearable creation,"" she says. ""We begin with analysis, researching shapes, lines, concepts, references, textures, inspirations, fits, and even variable degrees of shine—that´s how nerdy we can be. It´s all about the conceptual and creative challenges of launching a line that's cohesive, unique, and by all means; beautiful."" Sally GriffithsFor the Moscow-born, London-based designer, jewelry wasn't her first calling. Rather, she studied business before leaping into the world of accessories. ""I always knew that I´d start my own project and that it would be a creative one. Even when I was studying business I was interested in architecture and design,"" she explains. ""Jewelry is my true passion. The minute my grandfather gave me my first piece of jewelry when I was 14, I became an ad hoc jewelry researcher. Kova is the result of that informal education and my very formal business studies."" And while her homeland provides much of the inspiration, Kova's London base also delivers plenty of influences. ""Russia gave me a vast cultural legacy: The unparalleled graphic influence of artists Rodchenko, Malevich, and Kandinsky—to name just three. London on the other hand stimulated my creativity as an individual. It´s a city of creativity, talent, and brains that has made my vision so much more versatile.""More From Harper's BAZAARHer sculptural, minimalist pieces are also a step away from traditional fine jewelry, especially those that she grew up around. ""In Russia, fine jewelry is passed from generation to generation so it´s highly valued. Collecting fine jewelry has been a tradition in my family for generations. My favorite piece is the Tiffany & Co. bracelet that my grandfather gave me when I was 14. I still wear it all the time. It's not about trends, it´s about design integrity and the best stones."" In a rapidly changing accessories market, Kova's pieces personify a new approach to fine jewelry—unlike traditional fine jewels there's no need to keep them locked in a vault or only worn on special occasions. ""Women today understand fine jewelry as a wearable accessory rather than just an investment,"" agrees Kova. Her own personal approach to fashion and style is indicative of the change. ""I am not a girly girl but I´m not masculine either. I appreciate femininity but not in its literal instance. You won´t see me in ruffles and bows, you'll see me in pieces that are understated and elegant. I love wearing clothes that empower you, that give you confidence.""Read more from Tara from PROFYLES.com."

Trending Now In Our Store: Pajama Dressing,"Media Platforms Design TeamWith Earth Day coming up on Friday, the model and green activist chatted with us about her latest collaboration with Guy Bedarida of John Hardy. (Below left, one of the lovely recycled sterling-silver pieces.)How did the collaboration with Guy Bedarida come about? Very organically — Guy and I were introduced a few years ago and connected right away. Guy invited me to Bali — where he lives and the John Hardy workshop is located — to meet with him, the local artisans and see the compound. I was so inspired by the island's beauty and the local people that Guy and I began discussing how we could collaborate on a jewelry collection that would represent my visit. Bamboo is a ubiquitous plant in Bali so it was important for us to incorporate it into our designs and we did, you can see the Hijau (meaning ""green"" in Balinese) collection showcases the look of sliced bamboo. This year we are proud to launch Hijau Dua, our second collaboration.What were some of the biggest challenges and surprises that came up in the process?More From Harper's BAZAARDesigning the jewelry was exciting and challenging all at once.  One can never know how meticulous the design process is until they witness it firsthand.  First comes the sketch, then the mold is created and then the piece is cast; in the case of Hijau Dua in recycled sterling silver or 18K gold.  I was so impressed by the attention to detail Guy and his artisans pay to each and every piece of handcrafted jewelry.As someone who's previously been on the other side of the coin, what was it like designing pieces as opposed to modeling them?While I do love my work, I've always felt quite comfortable on the ""other side.""  I feel a great sense of accomplishment when I've worked hard to create something and see it come to life.What was your favorite aspect of your trip to Bali?The Balinese people are truly amazing.  They have such a commitment to nature and their surroundings.  It really blew me away to see how they take such pride in their work and utilizing everything the earth provides.We know you've been an eco-activist for some time. What do you hope will result from this collaboration, in terms of raising awareness about the environment?Yes, I have been committed to this for several years now and I think the best thing we can do to create true awareness is to educate. I even started my own foundation, Collage, a non-profit that tackles environmental and social issues through various partnerships and events. My collaboration with John Hardy is meant to inspire people everywhere to see that each and every one of us can make a difference in our own way.  For this collection, we are donating a portion of sales to John Hardy's ""Wear Bamboo, Plant Bamboo"" program, which plants a number of bamboo seedlings for every piece of jewelry sold.This content is imported from youTube.

The Best Jewelry On The Runway at New York Fashion Week,"Gaydamak's sparkling but tough, futuristic yet intricately wrought fine jewelry pieces feel like they're changing the game.Parisian sisters Sonia and Katia Gaydamak launched the brand in 2009 with an emphasis on the hand bracelet and have found a strong editorial footing, fans with means and count ladies like Natalia Vadianova amongst devotees. The sisters have the clout to match their unqiue aesthetic — both graduated from the New York Gemological Institute of America. BAZAAR spoke with the pair who split their time between London and Paris about making the ancient current and their signature piece.Harper's Bazaar: The pieces are beautiful but also feel innovative, what was your starting point for launching Gaydamak?Soni Gaydamak: It began with a desire to want to do something together. Our love for stones and passion for gemology made us look into that direction. We grew up in a house where most of the objects weren't used in a traditional or conventional way, so it made sense that our jewelry would follow the same destiny.More From Harper's BAZAARHB: What are the places/items that are inspiring you now?Katia Gaydamak: We have a fabulous collection of books on ancient fabrics. We like to reinterpret the ancient. But also the people we have met over the last few months, such as Zaha Hadid, have left a indelible mark on our collection to come.Media Platforms Design TeamHB: The hand bracelet is obviously the star, where did the idea come from? SG: Since we started, we wanted to add a signature piece to our name, but nothing really special came to mind. Katia was wearing a traditional bracelet that was too big, it fell on to her palm towards her fingers and that was it! It took a year for the development of the project and another year to get into the right retaillers over Europe and the US.HB: You are both certified gemologists, how has that helped your roles as designers specifically? SG: We like to chose the stones, gold and setters ourself. We travel to Asia, Israel or New York if we know we will find a special gem. But what is most important for us, is to find harmony between our sketches and the ultimate result.HB: What is your design process like? KG: Our mood boards are the most important moment in the creation of a new piece. We like to be overwelmed with ideas and then select what will be in the final product. ""Creativity is a full time job"" and not a moment. We like to sit and brain storm through various images, books and memories.HB: Who would you live to see wear Gaydamak?KG: In all fairness, we like the woman who thinks outside the box.

Top Trends for Spring 2009: Accessories,"We don't want to be so pedestrian as to call out a color of the season, but when there's a hue as rich and, let's face it, pretty, as a deep emerald green showing up all over the runway, we would be remiss not to mention it. Jason Wu took his green to military inspired places, while Peter Som's peplum dress erred more on the side of ladylike. Securing its place in a three-way trend, Yigal Azrouel used green in leather suiting for the cool girl.

"Three is a Trend: You Zig, I'll Zag","It sounds macabre when you say it, but looks very chic — if not a touch gothic — when you see it. We're referring to the growing ubiquity of ox blood on the Fall 2012 runways. We've concentrated on the use of the saturated hue on outwear, as seen at Alexander Wang, Tommy Hilfiger and Helmut Lang. The deeper shade of crimson is surprisingly versatile and can act as a neutral or an unexpected, rich alternative to black. Perhaps this trend is a residual affect of that never-ending pop culture obsession with all things vampiric.

The Top 5 Golden Globes 2012 Red Carpet Trends,"Best Actress nominee Lady Gaga arrived at the 2019 Oscars in a custom Alexander McQueen gown with major Audrey Hepburn vibes—and one of the most iconic pieces of jewelry in history.The Tiffany diamond, the most notable piece in the Tiffany & Co. archives, is a 128.54-carat fancy yellow diamond which typically sits on display (under lock and key) in the brand's Fifth Avenue flagship location. Given the value and its place in the 142-year history of the brand, this is only its third occasion being worn publicly. CourtesyThe diamond was first discovered in South Africa in 1877, and was acquired by Tiffany one year later. Upon its discovery, the stone was 287.42 carats, and was later cut down by Dr. George Frederick Kunz, Tiffany's chief gemologist at the time, into its current shape, a cushion-cut brilliant with 82 facets—24 more facets than a standard brilliant-cut stone.More From Harper's BAZAARGetty ImagesGetty ImagesGetty ImagesThe Tiffany diamond was first worn by Mrs. Mary Whitehouse at the 1957 Tiffany Ball in Newport, Rhode Island. Following that public appearance, Audrey Hepburn was granted permission to wear the diamond, in a Jean Schlumberger necklace of diamond ribbons surrounding the stone, for publicity photographs for her iconic role in Breakfast at Tiffany's. According to the brand, ""For Tiffany’s 175th anniversary in 2012, this priceless gem was reset in a magnificent necklace of dazzling white diamonds, totaling over 100 carats."" CourtesyThe Tiffany Diamond has never been worn to an award show in its history.  As for the price of the necklace in its current setting, the piece is not for sale, although it once was. Tiffany & Co. famously published an advertisement for the diamond in 1972 in the New York Times, offering any interested parties 24 hours to purchase the stone for $5,000,000 (almost $30,000,000 today). According to Tiffany, ""whether for reasons of thrift or disbelief, there were no buyers.""Lady Gaga, the singer-songwriter-turned-actress, is known for making history, so it comes as no surprise that her nomination for a Best Actress Oscar offers an ideal setting for the diamond's first-ever appearance on the red carpet..Carrie GoldbergWeddings & Travel DirectorCarrie Goldberg is HarpersBAZAAR.com’s Weddings & Travel Director.

Chanel Just Unveiled Its Most Opulent Jewelry in 90 Years,"Pinterest and Instagram are to thank for the stylistic sameness weddings across the board have reached; over-saturated trends have for too long been in favor, rather than daring to be different, or opting for a more personalized approach to wedding planning. From cheesy accessories to repetitive tabletop, florals, and decor motifs, here are the wedding trends we never want to see again—and the ways to reinvent them moving forward.1. BOHO CHICIs it really that chic? We've seen far too many chalkboard signs, rustic details, barns for barns-sake, naked cakes and Coachella-chic wedding gowns for our liking. If you do choose to wed on a farm, don't spend your energy bringing DIY, crafty, or contrasting decor inside. Instead, embrace your surroundings. This trend is at the top of our list thanks to one too many weddings that used a barn as their backdrop when they were better off at a chic hotel, a vineyard or in their backyard. Go all in on your setting in an authentic way; or, should you choose to bring in exterior inspirations, get inspired by a destination that speaks to the carefree, effortless, laid-back vibes you're clearly after. Taking cues from a rich culture that embodies the lax (yet luxe) feelings you crave are far more chic than macrame wall hangings, mason jar glasses, doily placemats, blush florals and chalkboard signage.John Dolan2. FLOWER CROWNSThese once-favored hair accessories are no longer the sweet, feminine extras we once loved them for. Instead, they hearken back to hazy days at Burning Man, and they're best left there. If you're obsessed, reinvent the wheel and create a headpiece that will look more unique than a basic wreath, use them on your flower girls rather than subjecting your bridesmaids to them, or for a novel idea—skip them altogether; they are not mandatory. Donning a flower crown doesn't look effortless; most of the time it looks like you tried really hard to look like a forest nymph. Instead, think more Frida Kahlo than Coachella for more of a statement hair flower moment, or delicately weave them into your hair in place of where any other hair adornments would typically be. Stick to petite blooms and a smaller scale overall rather than an oversized wreath, and try to incorporate minimal doses of color, choosing tones that complement your hair tone and texture. Corbin Gurkin3. LARGE BRIDAL PARTIESYou will spend your entire wedding day surrounded by your closest family and friends, and odds are they already know how much they mean to you. Trust us, not only would your friends rather wear looks they choose themselves, but your guests would rather not sit through a ceremony that drags on thanks to 10+ couples walking down the aisle before the bride. Your wedding photos will benefit from a variation in your friends' styling, rather than having 7+ women all dressed alike at your side. Instead, ask your closest 1-2 friends, or your sister(s), to stand by your side in a look that complements the feel and color palette of your wedding. Then, ask your closest friends to be on hand for a group photograph. In that larger shot, set your MOH or family apart by seating them or putting them in ivory so that they stand out with you. Christian Oth4. BULBOUS FLOWERS & OVERSIZED BOUQUETSNo shock here, but flowers should look like flowers—not like orbs or furniture. While some of the work designers can achieve with floral installations is a wonder to behold, keep in mind that overly done decor takes away from the intimacy and authenticity of your event. Rather than carry a flower ball down the aisle, opt for a not-as-tightly-packed bouquet, and stick to arrangements that incorporate hints of movement to showcase each bloom, rather than stuffing double the amount of flowers (and therefore, double the money) into a single vessel. Flower-heavy does not have to mean flower-packed. When flowers are tightly placed into tablescapes, decor or bouquets, they simply lose their luster and look like a large-scale texture rather than a collection of blooms. Carrying a smaller clutch of flowers arranged naturally won't overwhelm your dress–or your maid of honor when she has to hold it along with hers for the ceremony. If flower rich is your goal, try an array of arrangements in varying sizes for your tablescapes, and diversify your color palette to create depth and dimension in your decor. Ceremony arches, markers and installations are best kept looking somewhat organic and natural in feel, as is your bouquet–no matter whether your aesthetic is more soft and feminine, glamorous, and over-the-top or dark and moody. Asymmetry and movement is a good thing.Christian Oth5. BLUSH & ROSE GOLD Ask any wedding planner worth their salt, and they'll tell you that ""blush"" is pretty much a curse word at this point. They've simply heard it one too many times, and have exhausted their ideas for pale pink-meets-neutral toned celebrations. It's not that they can't do them, but deep down they're secretly wishing your wedding had more dimension and visual interest.  If you're into blush–we get it, it's gorgeous–include it in a wider color palette. Our favorite way to use it at the moment is in a more unexpected way, by layering it in with jewel tones, greenery and mustards for a rich yet moody feel. Choose a shade with more of a patina; true blush can appear far too feminine and saccharine in the wrong lighting. 42 North6. FAUX CALLIGRAPHYYou want your wedding invitation, table numbers, escort cards and more to be nothing short of elegant, but you may not want to spend on actual calligraphy. Nothing says ""we didn't want to spend money on calligraphy"" like faux calligraphy. Mix and match fonts and pair your invitation with painterly motifs that give the look and feel of a calligraphed invitation, without using a font that aims to imitate it. Script fonts work just as nicely and don't give off that same wannabe feel, while incorporating a serif font that feels strong and chic contrasts well with more artful, romantic and hand-crafted stationery suites. Christian Oth7. THE ROYAL WEDDING OBSESSIONYes, Will and Kate are perfection; Pippa was a dream bride; Meghan Markle bucked tradition and managed to embrace tradition all at the same time. You want it all, except...you're not a royal. While taking slight inspiration here and there from regal celebrations is more than acceptable, totally ripping off bridal looks, decor, or details is not. Everyone attending your wedding has already seen these famous nuptials on the small screen and the internet many times over. The same goes for celebrity celebrations; wearing Amal Clooney's gown or copying Kim and Kanye's flower walls are just that—copies. Your guests are looking to attend your celebration, not a replica of someone else's. Expand your royal vocabulary outside of England; royals from other European countries tend to have weddings that are more vibrant, bold and layered than the Brits. Take hints and details from celebrations you love, like all-lace veils and an overall formality, and incorporate them into a celebration all your own. FIH Fotographie8. NON-KEEPSAKE PHOTOSWedding photographers now feel the need to capture every single detail of the wedding day and its decor, even photos you'll likely never use. Those shots of your dress hanging in a doorway, shots of single candles on your tablescape, drunken dance floor shots, and more take the place of what could be a longer bridal or couple's portrait session, or a shot of you in a candid moment with your friends. Skip the fluff and get to the heart of the matter; it's worth letting your photographers shoot what they know you'll want to keep as a memento for years to come. Rid yourselves of all the excess and edit down to a shot list you really want to achieve on the day-of. Prioritize photos you'll want forever, like a gorgeous photo of you in your wedding gown and of you as a couple. Bruno Rezza9. BAD SIGNAGECheesy signs that take the place of basic directives are just that: cheesy. While they serve their purpose in ensuring guests take an escort card, choose their own seat, enjoy a cocktail, or drop your gifts off, they come off crafty. There are very few truly luxurious ways to spell things out on your wedding day, and we suggest you choose your signage wisely (read: ditch the wood panels and chalkboards). Choose fonts wisely; hard-to-read script that hearkens to the faux calligraphy trend are not the best when trying to get your message across. Instead, try this: Your event staff is there for a reason, and they can easily usher the guests in the right direction. If signs are a necessity, be direct: ""Right This Way"" with an arrow pointing guests toward cocktail hour or ""Take a Seat"" is far more elegant than a pun or a rhyme.Jose Villa10. INEDIBLE DESSERTS AND FAVORSFondant-covered cookies and kitschy trinkets may have seemed like a good idea in the planning process, but your guests will have no idea what to do with them. A hand-painted macaron brushed in luster dust only works if it doesn't coat your mouth in gold and actually tastes good, and a takeaway at the end of the night that isn't something easily enjoyed will likely end up getting tossed. Skip the strange tokens of your appreciation and give guests food and beverage options they're going to want to eat. Wolfgang PuckInstead, try this: Serve desserts that guests can't resist, and then send them home with something they can enjoy as a late night snack (like warm cookies and a spiked milk or a hangover kit full of goodies), a drink they can have as a nightcap (a petite bottle of whiskey with whiskey stones) or something they can have the next morning (artfully packaged bagels and schmear). It only adds to your guests' experience when they can sense that you've thought about the element of surprise along with their wants and needs long after the party.

The 19 Best Ballet Flats That Transcend Shoe Trends,"Usually, when Phoebe Bridgers talks about the moon, she's singing to a group of crying fans (I am, admittedly, one of them) who are mouthing the words to her ""Moon Song."" But last week, she could be found talking about astronomy in a not-heart-wrenching context—while wearing Chanel jewelry inspired by the stars. Standing underneath a crescent moon on a stage in Los Angeles, she introduced the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who were performing for Chanel’s guests at a dinner celebrating the launch of the 1932 jewelry collection, which is the second one ever released by the brand. The crowd cheered, but the 18-karat Coco Crush earrings and bracelet adorning Bridgers’s earlobes and wrist were beautiful enough that they could have elicited tears (of jealousy). Phoebe Bridgers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinIt has been 90 years since Gabrielle Chanel designed Bijoux de Diamants, the first high jewelry collection in history. It was created three years after Black Thursday pushed the world into the Great Depression, and Chanel was determined to create something that could shine through the turmoil. The 50-piece collection was made of white and yellow diamonds set in platinum and yellow gold, with 22 pieces inspired by specific constellations. “Nothing could be better for forgetting the crisis than feasting one’s eyes on beautiful new things,” she said of the collection. And so it feels fitting that in 2022, nearly three years after the entire world stood still for the pandemic, the fashion house she built would respond to our somber times with something just as sumptuous.More From Harper's BAZAARThe Yeah Yeah Yeahs performing at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinLike the original Bijoux de Diamants collection, the design of 1932 is harmonized around three symbols: the comet, the moon, and the sun. Chanel muses like Marion Cotillard, Lori Harvey, Greta Lee, and Whitney Peak were in attendance at the West Hollywood celebration, and, like Bridgers, were also layered in pieces from the 1932 collection named after the cosmos. Maggie Rogers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection. Pat MartinSinger Maggie Rogers, who also recently graduated from Harvard’s Divinity School, wore five rings from the collection but said the shooting star Comète ear cuff in 18-karat gold was her favorite. On the Chanel black carpet, Rogers mentioned how she felt a kinship with Gabrielle over her affinity for outer space: “[The cosmos] is something that has always resonated with me and is very apparent and present in my musical work.” Gossip Girl’s Whitney Peak said the collection made her feel like a “superstar” before joking, “I feel like I shouldn’t be wearing it. I don’t know how they let me get away with this!” and then grasping the 1932 Comète Couture necklace in 18-karat gold and diamonds around her neck. Whitney Peak at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinWhile there are 77 pieces in the collection, its signature piece is the Allure Céleste necklace, with round-cut diamonds, an oval sapphire of deep blue, and a weight of 55.5 carats. What makes it extraordinary is its ability to transform: The halos detach to become brooches, and the central row of diamonds becomes a bracelet, converting the necklace into a shorter version. Thirteen other pieces from the 1932 collection also have the ability to transform in a similar manner, allowing the wearer to make new diamond constellations around their wrists and necks.Guests dining at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinMany of the pieces were made without clasps, something Gabrielle Chanel openly disliked. “I detest clasps! I’ve done away with clasps! Yet my jewelry is transformable,” she said in an interview in 1932 after the “Bijoux de Diamants” exhibition. She strived to design pieces that offered flexibility to busy women with full lives, and that didn’t impede their freedom. And as the jewelry-spangled guests left their cares behind to dance under a canopy of baby’s breath, it was evident that the new 1932 collection stays true to her vision.Tara GonzalezTara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.

Katie Holmes Is Fully Embracing Fall's Latest Pants Trend,"Prada has never done things by the book. The brand has been creating the world's most desirable fashion pieces since their start over one hundred years ago, going from making humble leather goods to being one of the biggest privately owned brands in the world. Now, the brand is expanding on their aesthetic universe with a daring introduction into fine jewelry. The inaugural collection, titled ETERNAL GOLD, marks both a commitment to beauty and to sustainable, circular fashion.Maya Hawke for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsAs Prada's first-ever fine jewelry offering, ETERNAL GOLD is a first in many aspects. It's also the world's first fine jewelry collection made entirely with recycled gold, collected using the industry's most rigorous standards set by the Responsible Jewelry Council. Prada is also the first company to expand on diamond traceability, making every single carat count traceable down to its origins. The complete transparency of every material used in their jewelry, from sourcing to cutting to setting, is a radical step in the direction of honest production for an otherwise murky process. Somi Jeon for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsThe jewelry is a reflection of Prada's impact on the industry and a continuation of their efforts to creating beautiful objects that stands the test of time, as all fine jewelry should. ETERNAL GOLD is rife with Pradaisms, with the instantly recognizable Prada triangle rendered as sleek earrings and pendants, but also imbued in clasp closures, and more subtly, in chain links and as the head and tail of the snake bracelet.  The snake bracelet itself may at first recall other serpent bracelets, but finds its own voice with the sneaky Prada triangle and smooth, unvarnished gold. Heart pendants take on an edgy effect with the triangle chainlink it sits on.More From Harper's BAZAARCourtesyCourtesyPrada chose three voices of our time to don this foundational collection, representing where Prada is now and where it can go. Amanda Gorman, award-winning poet and activist, Maya Hawke, singer/songwriter, actress, and model, and Somi Jeon, musician, become one with the gold, immortalized in gold negative renderings by David Sims. The jewelry and its campaign represent the future of a wholly responsible planet that isn't sacrificing purity and beauty at its demise. The act of both looking good and doing good is something all brands should aim toward.From: ELLE USKevin LeBlancKevin LeBlanc is the Fashion Associate at ELLE Magazine.

Carly Cushnie Collaborates on a Sweet Aquamarine Jewelry Collection,"If looking stylish in sneakers and your boyfriend's button-down is a skill set, Kaia Gerber is the master.Yesterday, the model was seen walking around Los Angeles looking comfortable in an effortlessly cool ensemble that brought to mind the now-viral coastal grandmother trend. The outfit consisted of an oversized striped gray button-down, a cropped white tank top, and loose-fitting black trousers. She finished the look with the black Adidas sneakers every model seems to be wearing, a green handbag, and brown oval sunglasses.Gerber wore no makeup and kept her straight her down for the outing.BACKGRIDWhen she's not looking glamorous on the Cannes Film Festival red carpet with boyfriend Austin Butler, Gerber is showing off her relaxed model-off-duty style on low-key dates.For a screening of Elvis in New York City this June, Gerber looked casual but chic in a navy top, black miniskirt, and matching leather blazer. She finished the look with a pair of high socks and white sneakers, and accessorized with her green shoulder bag and black Ray-Ban sunglasses. And on a lunch date with Butler this August, the model wore an open cobalt blue button-down over a cropped tank in the same hue, relaxed black trousers, and her go-to black Adidas sneakers. She accessorized with the same oval sunglasses and green handbag she carried yesterday, along with diamond stud earrings.This week, the stylish star released her own collection of wardrobe essentials with Zara (available to shop since October 4). The drop includes more than 30 pieces, including leather trenches, white tanks, and slouchy trousers—very on brand for Gerber.Now, the model is also stepping into acting.

15 Trends from the 1960s That Are Still Everywhere in Fashion,"Is any woman as synonymous with another creature as Mariah Carey is with a butterfly?This week, the singer celebrated the 30th anniversary of the release of her groundbreaking album Butterfly, and now she celebrates the arrival of her collaboration with the jeweler Chopard, which launches in stores and online today, September 16. The pieces, a mix of butterflies rendered in diamonds on rings, bracelets, earrings, and a breathtaking statement necklace, commemorate Carey’s  longtime affinity for the creature who helped her conceptualize her life as an independent artist at the top of a male-dominated music industry. She describes the process of seeing and wearing the pieces, while simultaneously celebrating “my favorite album that I’ve done,” as an emotional experience. “It’s a major moment, and it’s a full circle moment,” she says. Here she tells us about conceptualizing the collection, her daily jewelry wardrobe, and how she will wear the pieces.Harper’s Bazaar: I want to start by talking about this incredible butterfly necklace. Mariah Carey: Oh my gosh.HB: The butterfly, of course, is this incredibly significant symbol of transformation for you. But seeing the butterfly rendered in diamonds reminded me of how dazzling they are. They’re the most beautiful living creatures. And I wondered if you learned anything about the butterfly, seeing it rendered in diamonds. The enduring symbol of the butterfly—I mean, we can go on and on about different people's interpretations and feelings. My own personal feelings are so very specific to my album Butterfly and that period of my life, which we are celebrating the anniversary of this year, [coincidentally] at the same time that this is all happening, right? Because we've been working on this [with Chopard] for two years together, and it happened by accident [that] we’re re-releasing the Butterfly album, which is my favorite album that I’ve done.And yes, I have a very specific relationship with the butterfly and just the whole metamorphosis of it. The way that I had to come through a very difficult time in my life and, you know, like they say, you’ve gotta go through something to get something. I had to get to that place where I felt empowered enough to metaphorically fly and be free from that place where I was. I started out in this industry as such a young girl in a really difficult world, dominated by men. I wrote this song as I was leaving this mansion that I had paid for half of, and [where] I had sort of created my own little prison, not really deliberately, but it ended up feeling that way. And I was leaving and I wrote the lyrics and the melody to [the song “Butterfly”]: Spread your wings and prepare to fly / for you have become a butterfly. And so that’s always stuck with me. I’ve made many albums since then, but it’s just very specific to me. So to see this magnificent butterfly necklace, and the ring—I mean, it was so much to even be able to say, I collaborated on this. To be able to admire the craft—I don’t want to say “craftsmanship.” Please give me another word.HB: The creation, the artistry?The artistry! That’s what it is. Just to be able to collaborate with Chopard and doing this collection is a humongous honor. I’m just here, ready to put some diamonds on and hang out. Whatever! Courtesy of Chopard.HB: What is your daily jewelry wardrobe? Are we wearing the butterfly ring every day and the necklace for special occasions? Or is there a different routine here?I am not really one for routines of any sort. I’m not a dancer. I don’t really like to follow rules. So I would wear any piece on any occasion. But right now i’m wearing a bracelet that my daughter made for me that says “Lamily” on it, which is an homage to my fans made of little beads and elastic, with some diamond bracelets. I would wear any piece from the collection in a casual moment, or more specifically the Happy Butterfly collection, which I love so much. I think they’re gonna look gorgeous stacked with even just a T-shirt and jeans, leggings, a simple dress. There’s just really great pieces that are attainable, as well as those gorgeous—I don’t find them over the top, some might say they are; they’re major—pieces that I live for.They are really major. And they feel so you. I can see you wearing this incredible butterfly necklace with a T-shirt, or these enormous leaf earrings.I would do that! I’m so ready to wear those. When Caroline [Scheufele, the president of Chopard] was evolving and creating them, she was explaining them to me and I knew exactly what she meant, but when I saw them, I was losing it. I mean, they’re just sick. It’s beyond. They’re so good. [Laughs.]Sounds like you and Caroline had good chemistry.I feel like Caroline probably has incredible chemistry with anyone cuz she’s so fun and carefree. I love that about her. She’s also an artist and a businesswoman, and to work with her to make this collection together, [it feels] even more extra special because it was my idea and I was able to watch it happen.Courtesy of Chopard.Would you say it’s true that diamonds are a girl’s best friend?Well, considering the people I know, for sure. Maybe the exception of one or two. You know, at the end of the day, they’re not going to steer you wrong! Do you feel like jewelry plays an important part in your life spiritually? It can be armor, but it also reflects the essential feminine aspects of who you are.That’s interesting. I’ve never thought of it that way. There were little things, little pieces that I’ve had throughout my life, where they did have their own—I wouldn’t say spiritual, but they had a sort of special significance to me where I would keep them on no matter what. Swimming, whatever I was doing, I would keep them on. Because they were that special to me. And at one point I lost a piece of jewelry that I loved so much, and it wasn’t even that it was a major thing. It just meant something to me. But with this collection, everything means so much to me that I’m just excited to share it with the world.

Fall 2022's 5 Best Jewelry Trends Are Unexpected and Bold,"Katie Holmes's classic street style has set its sights on the pants trend du jour: low-rise jeans. Yesterday, the Dawson's Creek alum was spotted out and about in New York City running errands while wearing an effortlessly stylish look. Her breezy, late-summer ensemble consisted of a blush pink spaghetti-strap cami tucked into a pair of baggy low-rise jeans in a light wash. She continued the minimalist approach with the rest of her outfit, wearing olive green flip-flops and carrying a maroon shoulder bag from A.P.C., eschewing jewelry entirely.BACKGRIDBaggy pants have made cameos in Holmes's street style before.Earlier this month, she made a cozy appearance in the city, accompanied by boyfriend Bobby Wooten III, while wearing an oversized slouchy pair of black trousers. She paired the statement pants with a classic light gray knit sweater with a red-and-cream pattern across the chest and shoulders, and finished the look with a brown leather cross-body bag.Back in June, the actress talked to BAZAAR.com about curating her sense of style, both on and off set.""I directed two films back-to-back this year, and I did the costumes as well, which made me appreciate my friends who are costume designers and all the costume designers I've worked with in the past,"" Holmes said of her work on Rare Objects and a still-untitled romance movie based in Connecticut. ""It made me appreciate silhouettes and cuts and color in a way I thought I had, but when you put it on camera, when you are trying to tell a story, you can see how clothing can do a lot of the work for you.""Of her personal wardrobe, she added, ""I love my T-shirts, and I love my vintage T-shirts.

The designer partnered with Starling's founder, Chelsey Bartrum, to design a handmade, 14-karat gold capsule collection featuring aquamarines and diamonds.

Kendall Jenner Paired the Perfect Cropped Cardigan with Summer's Favorite Shoe Trend,"Worn by celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, Kendall Jenner, Tracee Ellis Ross, Millie Bobby Brown, and more, the '90s- and Y2K-inspired braided tendril trend has only increased in popularity since its reemergence during the 2022 festival season. ""The tendril trend has always been an easy way to add a little 'razzle-dazzle' to any updo,"" Erinn Courtney, a natural hair expert at StyleSeat and celebrity stylist, tells BAZAAR.com. Typically crafted as a set of smaller, face-framing braids, braided tendrils are an easy way to elevate a go-to bun or ponytail. You can also quickly enhance a salon-quality blowout or beachy waves by adding a second pair of braids near the ears for a summery, carefree hair look.View full post on InstagramView full post on InstagramWhen it comes to the styling essentials needed for a braided tendril updo versus wearing your hair completely down, professionals say there isn't much difference in the products and tools to keep in your arsenal. ""Re-creating this look at home is pretty simple,"" says celebrity stylist and Mane Addicts artist Irinel de León, who counts stars like Bella Hadid, Chrissy Teigen, and Hailey Bieber as clients. ""You'll need a little gel, a tail comb, and two small rubber bands—more if you're looking to add braids throughout the hair as well.""Shop the Braided Tendril Hair TrendGoody Ouchless Women's Clear Elastic Hair Tie (250 Count)Now 33% Off$5 at AmazonCredit: AmazonOribe  Gel Serum Radiance$63 at oribe.comCredit: Oribeghd Tail Comb$22 at GHD HairCredit: ghdTancho High Grade Tique Vegetable Pomade in Lavender$20 at AmazonCredit: AmazonCreme of Nature Argan Oil Perfect Edges$5 at Sally BeautyCredit: Sally BeautyEvolve Perfect Edge BrushNow 50% Off$5 at AmazonCredit: Amazonslip  Pure Silk 6-Pack Skinny Scrunchies $39 at NordstromCredit: NordstromDe Leon recommends starting off the look by centering your hair down the middle and creating two triangular parts on the left- and right-hand sides. Depending on the thickness of your hair and your desired braid size, she advises using around a dime-sized amount of gel to create each braid. ""For updos in particular, I love using a little barber's brush to smooth hair into a cute bun or pony,"" she adds. ""I also recommend applying gel around the perimeter of the hair, brushing it upwards, then securing it with a hair tie.

12 Trends that Define 2022 So Far,"Kendall Jenner's latest off-duty look goes back to the basics.Earlier this week, the reality TV star and model stepped out wearing an iteration of one of her classic summer uniforms.

Jenner styled the look with this season's most covetable shoe option: the kitten heel. Her take on the trend involved an ivory pair resembling ballet flats and featuring the signature mini heels.For accessories, Jenner went subtle, opting for a black leather shoulder bag from The Row, skinny rectangular sunglasses, and a black belt.BACKGRIDSo far, the 818 founder's summer has been full of simple yet sophisticated looks like this one.Back in June, for instance, she put her own spin on the coastal grandmother trend by sporting a pair of powder-yellow shorts from Aritzia with a super-cropped gray tank top, plus a dusty-blue button-up from Almina Concept and a spacious black tote bag. In another outing, the model looked cool and casual in a black cami, a denim midi skirt from The Row, and a pair of black loafers, while flashing a bright orange wallet from Hermès.Jenner previously talked to BAZAAR.com about 818, her tequila brand.""It's been amazing to see how much 818 has accomplished in just over a year,"" she said in June.

Ana de Armas Supports BIPOC Jewelry Designers Through Natural Diamond Council Partnership,"Ahead of the premiere of her much-awaited film Blonde, in which she portrays Marilyn Monroe, Ana de Armas is diving into a world Monroe knew quite a lot about: diamonds.The film and fashion icon famously sang ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" in the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and was known for her elegant style and love of high jewelry (remember when she wore the spectacular yellow diamond necklace dubbed The Moon of Baroda?). At the time, however, the diamond industry was seen as untouchable and unreachable for both ordinary buyers and small jewelry designers, and only big names, such as De Beers and Tiffany & Co., got the business and the notoriety. At the same time, conflict diamonds and diamond smuggling became real problems.Now, the Natural Diamond Council, along with brand ambassador de Armas, is looking to change that by backing young designers from around the world and educating buyers on the current state of the industry, which is moving toward a more sustainable and inclusive future.More From Harper's BAZAAR""I started working with the NDC in 2020, and I think it was a process for me of learning,"" de Armas tells BAZAAR.com at the NDC's launch event on June 14 at the Beekman Hotel penthouse in New York City, adding that she got to see how women in Botswana ran diamond mines and handled tractors, and essentially got to know the community behind the precious stones.    Vincenzo DiminoOn Tuesday, the NDC debuted the collections of the second class of artists from its Emerging Designers Diamond Initiative, which launched in January 2021 with $1 million of diamond credit dedicated to supporting emerging BIPOC jewelry designers, in partnership with Lorraine Schwartz.Per the NDC, ""The diamond industry is historically a generational and handshake industry where emerging designers without prior connections often experience barriers to entry. The program sets to level the playing field by providing direct, career-lasting relationships with diamantaires by underwriting $1 million in diamond credit in the designers’ own names. Industry education and resources, mentor pairings, and financial support for production and CAD designs are NDC’s efforts to help create a more equitable future.""Vincenzo DiminoDe Armas, wearing a brilliant ring and necklace from Dorian Webb and a ring from Heart the Stones by Halle Millien, says it's powerful the way in which the NDC is supporting—and financially backing—artists in the community who need the space to simply do what they're good at.""As a minority myself, I remember the days when I just wanted the chance to be in the room. I wanted to just be there. Give me the opportunity and I'll show you what I can offer,"" de Armas says. ""The fact that they're mentoring and supporting and opening the doors to relationships and careers and resources for these guys and giving them the credit is incredible.""The Cuban actress is no stranger to red-carpet glamour, and she has been dripped in diamonds for roles several times over the course of her film career, but she says the passion and originality of the up-and-coming jewelry designers' diamond pieces prove there are still ways to break boundaries in the diamond world.""It's the new generations who are going to bring a new take on jewelry. We don't have to keep wearing or interpreting jewelry in the same way,"" she says.Vincenzo DiminoJewelry, and diamonds in particular, the actress agrees, can be incredibly personal. They can be much more than just beautiful, high-priced pieces we like to look at. A jewelry collection can be passed down for generations, it can carry different meanings and morph and be modernized through the years—take Duchess Kate's inherited jewelry from Princess Diana, for example.De Armas says there is one piece she bought herself that she cherishes above all others: an antique ring that reminds her of her grandmother.""I had a ring from my grandma that I'm pretty sure was not a diamond, but it was this dark red stone with little things around it, and I lost it at the airport and I was so, so, so, so sad,"" she recalls in a conversation with BAZAAR. ""And years went by, and then I was shooting a movie and we were shooting on the street and I bumped into an antique store and I found the version of that ring—same color, but this time real diamonds—and I had to get it. It wasn't my grandma's ring, but it just reminds me of her. I have it here, actually, because I always wear it."" Maybe not as meaningful but equally dazzling were the jewels de Armas got to wear while filming the 2021 James Bond film No Time to Die with Daniel Craig.""That was beautiful—such an incredible touch for the character. Everything was so simple but I just felt like the jewelry really matched her personality: so sparkly and shiny and happy,"" de Armas says.Vincenzo DiminoWalking around the NDC event, where the young designers showcased their diamond creations, the actress couldn't keep her eyes off Birthright Foundry's Heritage Diamond Ula Nifo choker, crafted from 18-karat yellow gold and natural white diamonds but inspired by whale tooth necklaces from Samoa. The Ula Nifo necklace was worn by Samoan chiefs and their children in ancient times, and signified wealth and status, designer Constance Polamalu explains.""It's just so different,"" de Armas says.Grant Mobley, a diamond and fine jewelry expert at the NDC, tells BAZAAR how rare and exciting it is to see a high-jewelry piece so influenced by a designer's underrepresented culture, and yet so wearable today.""If you think back to these incredible Samoan jewelry designs with the amazing necklace collars from well over 100 years ago, she's turning that into something that makes sense for the modern day, and she's also doing that with fine jewelry materials: gold, diamonds,"" he says. ""It's something that might've been worn hundreds of years ago by her ancestors, but she's making it something that she would wear and that you would see on the red carpet.""The collections of the latest EDDI class of designers—Casey Perez, Corey Anthony Jones, Lana Ogilvie (Sabre Jewelry), Mckenzie Liautaud, Halle Millien (Heart the Stones), and Ruben Manuel—will launch this Friday, June 17, on 1stDibs.

7 Bag Trends That’ll Be Everywhere in 2022,"Storing your jewelry can be an afterthought to wearing your jewelry. But your pendants and cocktail rings are still on display to you, in your home, when you're not wearing them.

Claude Home and Mejuri Created the Actual Chicest Jewelry Holders,"Lately I wonder if we’re living through a mass psychosis expressing itself through trend reporting. If it felt a year ago like anything goes—that the restrictions and trauma of the pandemic highlighted fashion and self-expression as a new outlet for freedom—increasingly it seems that there are a thousand trends happening at once. In just the past month, I have read stories about a new twist on the girlboss trend called “that girl,” a trend in which women really enjoy themselves, and a trend in which women enjoy themselves a little, plus “dinocore,” “clowncore,” and “twee.” On TikTok, trend forecasting has become the new influencer hustle, almost a trend itself; creators who can string together photographic evidence with a pithy and compelling monologue are performing a kind of competitive prophecy. And the platform’s algorithm seems to favor this sort of information sharing: the more ridiculous the prediction, the more traction it gains, and the more predictions we are fed. In the meantime, fast fashion brands like Shein have sped production to such a pace that they can both predict and reflect these trends, making them feel all the more real while we ping pong through “feels” and “vibes” with no aesthetic compass. Even runway fashion, which is supposed to move at a slower, biannual speed, has joined this rat race, as designers pack their shows with potential viral moments and styles that are replicable by anyone with a little ingenuity and a pair of scissors. The tempo of fashion makes everything feel quick, carefree, and, sometimes, unfortunately, even careless. Mostly it seems that people are doing things humans have done for most of the past century—relaxing, working hard, having martinis, not having martinis—but now we cannot resist the urge to package them into something that feels more meaningful than mere consumer choices.Jerry Lorenzo, the 44-year-old designer behind the brand Fear of God, is a man who has started many trends himself (real trends, that is). When he began his brand almost a decade ago, it was a luxury cornerstone of the hypebeast movement, which often encourages a cut-throat, product-driven style of consumerism. Lorenzo worked on an early season of Yeezy alongside then-Vetements designer Demna, and, after making T-shirts for Justin Bieber’s “Purpose” tour, helped turn merch into meaningful clothes. He was a close friend of and collaborator with the late Virgil Abloh, whose brand Off-White propelled streetwear to the forefront of fashion, and his sneakers and sweatpants remain staples in hip corridors of Los Angeles and New York. But lately, Lorenzo has been on a different kind of fashion journey. In early 2020 he collaborated with Ermenegildo Zegna’s Alessandro Sartori for a collection that shifted menswear’s inner circle’s attitude around suiting, making it feel less performative and more like a staple. And now his collections, which arrive on his own time rather than seasonally, serve a slower, even higher purpose. Today, he is releasing a new collection, his first in nearly two years. As he worked on it, he said in a video interview late last week, he asked himself of every garment, “Is this timeless?”“I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now,” he said. “And I want to provide a safe space for someone that wants to step outside of that, but can still step into that conversation with everyone else that’s of ‘the now’ and feel of ‘the now,’ but not have to be so on trend.” Instead, what he wants his clothing to do is help his customers “feel the confidence. I want them to feel sophisticated, but I want them to feel the freedom to be themselves and know that it’s not the trend that validates you. It’s the individual that you are.” Lorenzo calls this collection Eternal. And while the clothing is a natural progression of the easy elegance of the collections he dropped in late summer and fall of 2020, it seems quite radical, to me, to proclaim you want to defy the trend cycle and try to make something that has lasting value. It seems so obvious, to try to float above it all, and yet the intoxicating quest for relevance has made it a rare impulse. Lorenzo is almost dipping into the realm of slow fashion—of designers with far less recognizable names who rarely stage fashion shows, like the 19th-century inspired work of Paul Harnden, the simple French cottons of Casey Casey, or the heady beauty of Elena Dawson. They make clothing that is intentionally hard to find and difficult to make. Lorenzo hasn’t gone that far, of course, and he has in his corner the fact that his clothing is meant to make you feel as comfortable in a suit as you are in your favorite sweatshirt. That means it has the potential to transcend the cognoscenti customer of slow fashion brands, or perhaps convert recovering hypebeasts into cognoscenti. He is designing with incredible thoughtfulness, even integrity–almost like a novel. “I approach it like a book or a music album,” said Lorenzo of putting together collections. “I don't really approach it in terms of seasons and seasonality. I approach it like, Hey, do I have something to say? Do I have the resources to say what I wanna say in the best way?” He remains independently owned–he also has a partnership with Adidas, where he serves as the head of strategy for their basketball category—and his resources are just catching up to his point of view, as he put it. He’s been able to move 80% of his production to Italy, for example. “And so hopefully each time we have something to say, it’s better than the last thing we said.” Lorenzo, of course, isn’t the only designer to prize continual improvement over novelty. The Row’s Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen come to mind, and Lorenzo, like The Row and other influential American aesthetes, is particularly drawn, lately, to the 1980s and ’90s designs of Giorgio Armani. His cascades of beige in flowing, almost spiritually understated cuts wrote a new script for minimalism. If Prada was cerebral, edgy, and obscure, and Calvin Klein was sexy, Armani was, just as Lorenzo said, a man of confidence, whose clothing blessed its wearers with a feeling of monastic chic weightlessness. “I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now.”In Eternal, the cuts are generous without swamping their wearer in fabric; the tones are bones, milky beiges, and greyish whites; and nearly all the pants blur the line between a structured trouser and a cozy sweatpant. You can see how a person dressed in these clothes might calm a room of investors or subtly change the energy in a coffee shop line. “I am in fashion, and I do love to present myself a certain way,” Lorenzo mused. “But that’s always been something that is understated. It’s always been something that isn’t loud and doesn’t call for attention. As quiet as I want to be in a room, I also want to be competent, you know?” Like Armani—and again, like The Row—Lorenzo is thinking about how his clothing might provide solutions, not only to the holes in your wardrobe but to your own questions about your sense of self. How do you wear a suit, which has different proportions and fabrics than a hoodie or track pants, and still feel like yourself? “That’s what I’m always chasing, you know? How can I be always sophisticated in the way that I present myself, but honest, and relaxed and comfortable?” Lorenzo’s evolution as a designer over the past decade, from a Los Angeles DJ to a new hero in intentional clothing creation, has been one of fashion’s most interesting. By staying independent, he’s allowed himself the time to grow and explore that investors or big luxury house appointments rarely afford. Too often, a designer’s references are too readily apparent, too surface—Ralph Lauren’s Polo line, or Annie Leibowitz’s images for The Gap, or the wackadoo spirit of 1980s couture that seems to have captured the imagination of many young womenswear designers in New York. In fact, prior to his dalliance with Zegna, Lorenzo spoke about wanting to build a brand like Lauren’s. But Lorenzo has a new modesty about him, and his clothing feels intimate in a way that Lauren’s, which is much more like a worshipful encyclopedia of American style, simply cannot. We talked about how opting out of trendiness can be quite boring—depending on how many viscose trouser-wearing influencers you follow on Instagram, you might say it’s even something of a trend itself—and how he’s tweaked his pieces, and played with fabrics, to give his pieces some heart and some personality. Changing the shoulder on a jacket from a past collection to make it feel less 1980s, for example. The result is that these are real clothes, for someone who is not trying to create a look for a moment in time, but who believes fashion can improve your life in small but significant ways.Open GalleryRachel TashjianRachel Tashjian is the Fashion News Director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.

5 Jewelry Trends Worth Adding to Your Collection This Summer,"No one does glamour quite like Anya Taylor-Joy. So, to no one's surprise, The Queen's Gambit star looked incredible at the 73rd annual Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles last night.

Tiffany and Co. Tiffany and Co.Taylor-Joy's gown for the evening was embellished with two of the luxury jeweler's Elsa Peretti Diamonds by the Yard platinum necklaces elegantly draped down the actress's back— a mesmerizing look that was inspired by classic movie stars from Old Hollywood's past. She also wore platinum diamond starburst earrings, a yellow sapphire and baguette diamond bracelet from the brand's Blue Book Collection, and two major statement rings: an over-17-carat yellow sapphire diamond and a stunning platinum vine-shaped ring.  Tiffany and Co.Tiffany and Co.The actress's breathtaking beauty look for the night was equally dramatic, with Taylor Joy opting for a matte complexion, flushed cheeks, neutral eye shadow, wispy lashes, and vibrant red lips. She wore her hair in a vintage-inspired, delicately styled bouffant, but added a modern, kitschy touch with a bright-yellow manicure as well. Taylor-Joy's red-carpet look was easily one of the standouts of the evening, winning over social media and best-dressed lists alike (including ours) for its fresh and timeless approach to red-carpet style and glamour.

10 Hair Trends to Try for Summer 2022,"MoAna Luu has spent her professional life building brands, from designing boutique hotels to serving as chief content and creative officer at Essence. But after contracting Covid-19 in March 2020, Luu decided to refocus on a new brand-building effort—one that’s entirely her own. That project is ManLuu, a line of luxury jewelry paying homage to Luu’s Creole heritage—a blend of African, Indian, French, and Caribbean traditions—and Martinique’s long tradition of jewelry-making. ManLuu arrives today at Nordstrom for its official, 21-item debut following a soft online launch this summer. ManLuu is composed of gender neutral earrings, bracelets, and rings in 18k gold vermeil and sterling silver. Nods to Creole jewelry tradition emerge through ManLuu’s use of exaggerated geometric shapes and signature woven patterns (an octagonal hoop with webbed inlays here, a chunky beaded bracelet there). ""The craftsmanship is something that is so delicate, when you see it you know you have a precious piece already,"" Luu says.More From Harper's BAZAARSome of the designer's earliest introductions to Creole craftsmanship came from her grandparents’ jewelry store in Fort-de-France, Martinique, Luu tells BAZAAR.com. But ManLuu’s devotion to quality is inspired by even earlier references, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. At that time, Black people could not become property owners, so they invested in gold jewelry heirlooms to pass down among generations. Luu says that ManLuu shares the power of this story, one that many people may not know, through each piece.MoAna Luu at the ManLuu atelier in New York City.ManLuuManLuu’s interpretation of heirloom jewelry had resonated long before this week’s Nordstrom launch. Gwyneth Paltrow, Mary J. Blige, and Maye Musk are a few of its early fans. Cardi B. even wore ManLuu bangles to announce her second pregnancy earlier this year—a special stamp of approval for the brand, Luu tells us. Joining forces with a large retailer like Nordstrom is, in some ways, even more significant than those celebrity endorsements. ""As a Black female designer and founder, I believe it's important that heritage brands welcome new creators and support them taking their place in the luxury market,"" Luu explains. ""This is a big step, not just for me, but for all of us.""While ManLuu's approach to luxury references centuries-old jewelry traditions, its use of eco-friendly materials is thoroughly 2021. Many pieces are crafted with recycled metals; later on, ManLuu will also incorporate lab-grown diamonds. Luu couldn't imagine starting a new label without incorporating conscious design techniques: “Sustainability is something that, today, is mandatory in any business."" By balancing meaningful history with modern design, ManLuu is an alternative to the throwaway jewelry sold, well, nearly everywhere. “Fast fashion was nice,” Luu says, “but now it’s time for pieces you want to keep.” And one day, pass down.Shop Manluu at NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$770 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Classic Beaded Necklace$2,650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Open Ring$600 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Cuff Bracelet$2,800 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$370 at NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$900 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Ear Jackets$1,000 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$570 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Embossed Ring$650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Long Beaded Necklace$4,200 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$470 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$1,100 at NordstromCredit: NordstromHalie LeSavageHalie LeSavage is the fashion commerce editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, where she covers everything from emerging designers to viral products to must-shop sales events.

The 27 Best Closet and Jewelry Organizers for Decluttering Your Space,"No one can take a time-out from the Y2K fashion revival. Not even our iPhones. Like bucket hats and platform flip flops before them, phone straps of the early aughts variety are having a renaissance. Think of these attachable lanyards like the camp jewelry trend, but for your phone. The plainest phone straps start with rainbow-colored resin beads and get kitschier from there. Entire indie brands are dedicated to beaded phone straps, with String Ting, GriGri, and Hang On credited in mirror selfies across Instagram. Established accessories players are catching on, with versions appearing at Roxanne Assoulin and Lele Sadoughi. View full post on InstagramAlex Bass, founder at phone strap seller Hang On, says Y2K nostalgia is a big part of her brand. Hang On’s aesthetic harkens back to the days when cell phones were a novelty and personalizing them was a compulsion—the more glitter, the better. In Bass’s case, she stuck “stickers and rhinestones on every square centimeter of the phone, à la Carrie Bradshaw.”More From Harper's BAZAARBut there’s more to the phone strap trend than 2000 calling to give our lucky charms back,  String Ting founder Rachel Steed-Middleton tells BAZAAR.com. “The ‘smartphone-is-my-life’ way of being is more current and of the times, so this is really a very new and modern-day category of accessorizing,” she says.

Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, and Kaia Gerber have all been spotted with String Tings dangling from their phones.“Being more connected to our devices naturally makes us think about what they look like and how we can personalize them,” Bass agrees. “With Hang On, we’ve tried to capitalize on this trend but also reshape its narrative.” The brand offers two-for-one discounts on its charms—to encourage shoppers to buy one for a friend, and remind them to stay in touch.

9 Micro Trends from New York Fashion Week,"Thanks to an early passion for vintage fashion, jewelry designer Pamela Love knows her way around sartorial classics.

25 Minimalist Jewelry Finds You Can Buy on Amazon,"Katie Kova is petite, quietly spoken, and very chic (think simple, understated style that conveys a quiet sort of elegance). Her newly launched fine jewelry label, Kova, follows in much the same vein. ""My jewelry is 100% wearable, stackable, mixable, and day-to-night viable,"" she says. ""I wear it with a T-shirt and flats and with a cocktail dress and stilettos.""Inspired by the 20th-century Russian art movement Suprematism (invented by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich, it was one of the earliest and most radical developments in abstract art), Kova's pieces possess the same sort of graphic, linear construction and minimalist feel as her favorite artworks. An ear cuff features circles and zig zag lines embedded with dozens of black and white pave diamonds, while a pair of triangular earrings have slight differences in each side. ""At Kova we see jewelry as a form of wearable creation,"" she says. ""We begin with analysis, researching shapes, lines, concepts, references, textures, inspirations, fits, and even variable degrees of shine—that´s how nerdy we can be. It´s all about the conceptual and creative challenges of launching a line that's cohesive, unique, and by all means; beautiful."" Sally GriffithsFor the Moscow-born, London-based designer, jewelry wasn't her first calling. Rather, she studied business before leaping into the world of accessories. ""I always knew that I´d start my own project and that it would be a creative one. Even when I was studying business I was interested in architecture and design,"" she explains. ""Jewelry is my true passion. The minute my grandfather gave me my first piece of jewelry when I was 14, I became an ad hoc jewelry researcher. Kova is the result of that informal education and my very formal business studies."" And while her homeland provides much of the inspiration, Kova's London base also delivers plenty of influences. ""Russia gave me a vast cultural legacy: The unparalleled graphic influence of artists Rodchenko, Malevich, and Kandinsky—to name just three. London on the other hand stimulated my creativity as an individual. It´s a city of creativity, talent, and brains that has made my vision so much more versatile.""More From Harper's BAZAARHer sculptural, minimalist pieces are also a step away from traditional fine jewelry, especially those that she grew up around. ""In Russia, fine jewelry is passed from generation to generation so it´s highly valued. Collecting fine jewelry has been a tradition in my family for generations. My favorite piece is the Tiffany & Co. bracelet that my grandfather gave me when I was 14. I still wear it all the time. It's not about trends, it´s about design integrity and the best stones."" In a rapidly changing accessories market, Kova's pieces personify a new approach to fine jewelry—unlike traditional fine jewels there's no need to keep them locked in a vault or only worn on special occasions. ""Women today understand fine jewelry as a wearable accessory rather than just an investment,"" agrees Kova. Her own personal approach to fashion and style is indicative of the change. ""I am not a girly girl but I´m not masculine either. I appreciate femininity but not in its literal instance. You won´t see me in ruffles and bows, you'll see me in pieces that are understated and elegant. I love wearing clothes that empower you, that give you confidence.""Read more from Tara from PROFYLES.com."

The Top Bridal Trends for 2022 Weddings,"Media Platforms Design TeamWith Earth Day coming up on Friday, the model and green activist chatted with us about her latest collaboration with Guy Bedarida of John Hardy. (Below left, one of the lovely recycled sterling-silver pieces.)How did the collaboration with Guy Bedarida come about? Very organically — Guy and I were introduced a few years ago and connected right away. Guy invited me to Bali — where he lives and the John Hardy workshop is located — to meet with him, the local artisans and see the compound. I was so inspired by the island's beauty and the local people that Guy and I began discussing how we could collaborate on a jewelry collection that would represent my visit. Bamboo is a ubiquitous plant in Bali so it was important for us to incorporate it into our designs and we did, you can see the Hijau (meaning ""green"" in Balinese) collection showcases the look of sliced bamboo. This year we are proud to launch Hijau Dua, our second collaboration.What were some of the biggest challenges and surprises that came up in the process?More From Harper's BAZAARDesigning the jewelry was exciting and challenging all at once.  One can never know how meticulous the design process is until they witness it firsthand.  First comes the sketch, then the mold is created and then the piece is cast; in the case of Hijau Dua in recycled sterling silver or 18K gold.  I was so impressed by the attention to detail Guy and his artisans pay to each and every piece of handcrafted jewelry.As someone who's previously been on the other side of the coin, what was it like designing pieces as opposed to modeling them?While I do love my work, I've always felt quite comfortable on the ""other side.""  I feel a great sense of accomplishment when I've worked hard to create something and see it come to life.What was your favorite aspect of your trip to Bali?The Balinese people are truly amazing.  They have such a commitment to nature and their surroundings.  It really blew me away to see how they take such pride in their work and utilizing everything the earth provides.We know you've been an eco-activist for some time. What do you hope will result from this collaboration, in terms of raising awareness about the environment?Yes, I have been committed to this for several years now and I think the best thing we can do to create true awareness is to educate.

Tommy Hilfiger is back to his original color palette of red, white and blue to offer bathing suits and shirt dresses in an elegant, patriotically shaded zig zag print. Band of Outsiders, inspired by the Japanese dyeing techniques of shibori, took a more relaxed and wavy approach to the magic eye version of herringbone.

The Coolest Nail Trends For 2021,"Gaydamak's sparkling but tough, futuristic yet intricately wrought fine jewelry pieces feel like they're changing the game.Parisian sisters Sonia and Katia Gaydamak launched the brand in 2009 with an emphasis on the hand bracelet and have found a strong editorial footing, fans with means and count ladies like Natalia Vadianova amongst devotees. The sisters have the clout to match their unqiue aesthetic — both graduated from the New York Gemological Institute of America. BAZAAR spoke with the pair who split their time between London and Paris about making the ancient current and their signature piece.Harper's Bazaar: The pieces are beautiful but also feel innovative, what was your starting point for launching Gaydamak?Soni Gaydamak: It began with a desire to want to do something together. Our love for stones and passion for gemology made us look into that direction. We grew up in a house where most of the objects weren't used in a traditional or conventional way, so it made sense that our jewelry would follow the same destiny.More From Harper's BAZAARHB: What are the places/items that are inspiring you now?Katia Gaydamak: We have a fabulous collection of books on ancient fabrics. We like to reinterpret the ancient. But also the people we have met over the last few months, such as Zaha Hadid, have left a indelible mark on our collection to come.Media Platforms Design TeamHB: The hand bracelet is obviously the star, where did the idea come from? SG: Since we started, we wanted to add a signature piece to our name, but nothing really special came to mind. Katia was wearing a traditional bracelet that was too big, it fell on to her palm towards her fingers and that was it! It took a year for the development of the project and another year to get into the right retaillers over Europe and the US.HB: You are both certified gemologists, how has that helped your roles as designers specifically? SG: We like to chose the stones, gold and setters ourself. We travel to Asia, Israel or New York if we know we will find a special gem. But what is most important for us, is to find harmony between our sketches and the ultimate result.HB: What is your design process like? KG: Our mood boards are the most important moment in the creation of a new piece. We like to be overwelmed with ideas and then select what will be in the final product. ""Creativity is a full time job"" and not a moment. We like to sit and brain storm through various images, books and memories.HB: Who would you live to see wear Gaydamak?KG: In all fairness, we like the woman who thinks outside the box. A woman who feels free and strong yet feminine and sexy.HB: How would you describe the aesthetic of the brand? SG: Just like the woman that wears it — free. HB: What is it like being in business with your sister? How do you work together?SG: We initially wanted to seperate the tasks but as time went by we realized that we needed each other's input on all matters.KG: Officially Sonia is in charge of the development and me of design. But in reality, we can't be seperated for more than an hour!Kerry PieriDigital Fashion/Features DirectorKerry Pieri is Harper's Bazaar's Digital Fashion/Features Director.

Jewelry Designer Pamela Love on Finding Great Vintage Pieces,"It sounds macabre when you say it, but looks very chic — if not a touch gothic — when you see it. We're referring to the growing ubiquity of ox blood on the Fall 2012 runways. We've concentrated on the use of the saturated hue on outwear, as seen at Alexander Wang, Tommy Hilfiger and Helmut Lang. The deeper shade of crimson is surprisingly versatile and can act as a neutral or an unexpected, rich alternative to black. Perhaps this trend is a residual affect of that never-ending pop culture obsession with all things vampiric.

The Best Winter Hair Trends for 2019,"Best Actress nominee Lady Gaga arrived at the 2019 Oscars in a custom Alexander McQueen gown with major Audrey Hepburn vibes—and one of the most iconic pieces of jewelry in history.The Tiffany diamond, the most notable piece in the Tiffany & Co. archives, is a 128.54-carat fancy yellow diamond which typically sits on display (under lock and key) in the brand's Fifth Avenue flagship location. Given the value and its place in the 142-year history of the brand, this is only its third occasion being worn publicly. CourtesyThe diamond was first discovered in South Africa in 1877, and was acquired by Tiffany one year later. Upon its discovery, the stone was 287.42 carats, and was later cut down by Dr. George Frederick Kunz, Tiffany's chief gemologist at the time, into its current shape, a cushion-cut brilliant with 82 facets—24 more facets than a standard brilliant-cut stone.More From Harper's BAZAARGetty ImagesGetty ImagesGetty ImagesThe Tiffany diamond was first worn by Mrs. Mary Whitehouse at the 1957 Tiffany Ball in Newport, Rhode Island. Following that public appearance, Audrey Hepburn was granted permission to wear the diamond, in a Jean Schlumberger necklace of diamond ribbons surrounding the stone, for publicity photographs for her iconic role in Breakfast at Tiffany's. According to the brand, ""For Tiffany’s 175th anniversary in 2012, this priceless gem was reset in a magnificent necklace of dazzling white diamonds, totaling over 100 carats."" CourtesyThe Tiffany Diamond has never been worn to an award show in its history.  As for the price of the necklace in its current setting, the piece is not for sale, although it once was. Tiffany & Co. famously published an advertisement for the diamond in 1972 in the New York Times, offering any interested parties 24 hours to purchase the stone for $5,000,000 (almost $30,000,000 today). According to Tiffany, ""whether for reasons of thrift or disbelief, there were no buyers.""Lady Gaga, the singer-songwriter-turned-actress, is known for making history, so it comes as no surprise that her nomination for a Best Actress Oscar offers an ideal setting for the diamond's first-ever appearance on the red carpet..Carrie GoldbergWeddings & Travel DirectorCarrie Goldberg is HarpersBAZAAR.com’s Weddings & Travel Director.

Trending Now in Our Store: Parisian Chic,"Pinterest and Instagram are to thank for the stylistic sameness weddings across the board have reached; over-saturated trends have for too long been in favor, rather than daring to be different, or opting for a more personalized approach to wedding planning. From cheesy accessories to repetitive tabletop, florals, and decor motifs, here are the wedding trends we never want to see again—and the ways to reinvent them moving forward.1. BOHO CHICIs it really that chic? We've seen far too many chalkboard signs, rustic details, barns for barns-sake, naked cakes and Coachella-chic wedding gowns for our liking. If you do choose to wed on a farm, don't spend your energy bringing DIY, crafty, or contrasting decor inside. Instead, embrace your surroundings. This trend is at the top of our list thanks to one too many weddings that used a barn as their backdrop when they were better off at a chic hotel, a vineyard or in their backyard. Go all in on your setting in an authentic way; or, should you choose to bring in exterior inspirations, get inspired by a destination that speaks to the carefree, effortless, laid-back vibes you're clearly after. Taking cues from a rich culture that embodies the lax (yet luxe) feelings you crave are far more chic than macrame wall hangings, mason jar glasses, doily placemats, blush florals and chalkboard signage.John Dolan2. FLOWER CROWNSThese once-favored hair accessories are no longer the sweet, feminine extras we once loved them for. Instead, they hearken back to hazy days at Burning Man, and they're best left there. If you're obsessed, reinvent the wheel and create a headpiece that will look more unique than a basic wreath, use them on your flower girls rather than subjecting your bridesmaids to them, or for a novel idea—skip them altogether; they are not mandatory. Donning a flower crown doesn't look effortless; most of the time it looks like you tried really hard to look like a forest nymph. Instead, think more Frida Kahlo than Coachella for more of a statement hair flower moment, or delicately weave them into your hair in place of where any other hair adornments would typically be. Stick to petite blooms and a smaller scale overall rather than an oversized wreath, and try to incorporate minimal doses of color, choosing tones that complement your hair tone and texture. Corbin Gurkin3. LARGE BRIDAL PARTIESYou will spend your entire wedding day surrounded by your closest family and friends, and odds are they already know how much they mean to you. Trust us, not only would your friends rather wear looks they choose themselves, but your guests would rather not sit through a ceremony that drags on thanks to 10+ couples walking down the aisle before the bride. Your wedding photos will benefit from a variation in your friends' styling, rather than having 7+ women all dressed alike at your side. Instead, ask your closest 1-2 friends, or your sister(s), to stand by your side in a look that complements the feel and color palette of your wedding. Then, ask your closest friends to be on hand for a group photograph. In that larger shot, set your MOH or family apart by seating them or putting them in ivory so that they stand out with you. Christian Oth4. BULBOUS FLOWERS & OVERSIZED BOUQUETSNo shock here, but flowers should look like flowers—not like orbs or furniture. While some of the work designers can achieve with floral installations is a wonder to behold, keep in mind that overly done decor takes away from the intimacy and authenticity of your event. Rather than carry a flower ball down the aisle, opt for a not-as-tightly-packed bouquet, and stick to arrangements that incorporate hints of movement to showcase each bloom, rather than stuffing double the amount of flowers (and therefore, double the money) into a single vessel. Flower-heavy does not have to mean flower-packed. When flowers are tightly placed into tablescapes, decor or bouquets, they simply lose their luster and look like a large-scale texture rather than a collection of blooms. Carrying a smaller clutch of flowers arranged naturally won't overwhelm your dress–or your maid of honor when she has to hold it along with hers for the ceremony. If flower rich is your goal, try an array of arrangements in varying sizes for your tablescapes, and diversify your color palette to create depth and dimension in your decor. Ceremony arches, markers and installations are best kept looking somewhat organic and natural in feel, as is your bouquet–no matter whether your aesthetic is more soft and feminine, glamorous, and over-the-top or dark and moody. Asymmetry and movement is a good thing.Christian Oth5. BLUSH & ROSE GOLD Ask any wedding planner worth their salt, and they'll tell you that ""blush"" is pretty much a curse word at this point. They've simply heard it one too many times, and have exhausted their ideas for pale pink-meets-neutral toned celebrations. It's not that they can't do them, but deep down they're secretly wishing your wedding had more dimension and visual interest.  If you're into blush–we get it, it's gorgeous–include it in a wider color palette. Our favorite way to use it at the moment is in a more unexpected way, by layering it in with jewel tones, greenery and mustards for a rich yet moody feel. Choose a shade with more of a patina; true blush can appear far too feminine and saccharine in the wrong lighting. 42 North6. FAUX CALLIGRAPHYYou want your wedding invitation, table numbers, escort cards and more to be nothing short of elegant, but you may not want to spend on actual calligraphy. Nothing says ""we didn't want to spend money on calligraphy"" like faux calligraphy. Mix and match fonts and pair your invitation with painterly motifs that give the look and feel of a calligraphed invitation, without using a font that aims to imitate it. Script fonts work just as nicely and don't give off that same wannabe feel, while incorporating a serif font that feels strong and chic contrasts well with more artful, romantic and hand-crafted stationery suites. Christian Oth7. THE ROYAL WEDDING OBSESSIONYes, Will and Kate are perfection; Pippa was a dream bride; Meghan Markle bucked tradition and managed to embrace tradition all at the same time. You want it all, except...you're not a royal. While taking slight inspiration here and there from regal celebrations is more than acceptable, totally ripping off bridal looks, decor, or details is not. Everyone attending your wedding has already seen these famous nuptials on the small screen and the internet many times over. The same goes for celebrity celebrations; wearing Amal Clooney's gown or copying Kim and Kanye's flower walls are just that—copies. Your guests are looking to attend your celebration, not a replica of someone else's. Expand your royal vocabulary outside of England; royals from other European countries tend to have weddings that are more vibrant, bold and layered than the Brits. Take hints and details from celebrations you love, like all-lace veils and an overall formality, and incorporate them into a celebration all your own. FIH Fotographie8. NON-KEEPSAKE PHOTOSWedding photographers now feel the need to capture every single detail of the wedding day and its decor, even photos you'll likely never use. Those shots of your dress hanging in a doorway, shots of single candles on your tablescape, drunken dance floor shots, and more take the place of what could be a longer bridal or couple's portrait session, or a shot of you in a candid moment with your friends. Skip the fluff and get to the heart of the matter; it's worth letting your photographers shoot what they know you'll want to keep as a memento for years to come. Rid yourselves of all the excess and edit down to a shot list you really want to achieve on the day-of. Prioritize photos you'll want forever, like a gorgeous photo of you in your wedding gown and of you as a couple. Bruno Rezza9. BAD SIGNAGECheesy signs that take the place of basic directives are just that: cheesy. While they serve their purpose in ensuring guests take an escort card, choose their own seat, enjoy a cocktail, or drop your gifts off, they come off crafty. There are very few truly luxurious ways to spell things out on your wedding day, and we suggest you choose your signage wisely (read: ditch the wood panels and chalkboards). Choose fonts wisely; hard-to-read script that hearkens to the faux calligraphy trend are not the best when trying to get your message across. Instead, try this: Your event staff is there for a reason, and they can easily usher the guests in the right direction. If signs are a necessity, be direct: ""Right This Way"" with an arrow pointing guests toward cocktail hour or ""Take a Seat"" is far more elegant than a pun or a rhyme.Jose Villa10. INEDIBLE DESSERTS AND FAVORSFondant-covered cookies and kitschy trinkets may have seemed like a good idea in the planning process, but your guests will have no idea what to do with them. A hand-painted macaron brushed in luster dust only works if it doesn't coat your mouth in gold and actually tastes good, and a takeaway at the end of the night that isn't something easily enjoyed will likely end up getting tossed. Skip the strange tokens of your appreciation and give guests food and beverage options they're going to want to eat. Wolfgang PuckInstead, try this: Serve desserts that guests can't resist, and then send them home with something they can enjoy as a late night snack (like warm cookies and a spiked milk or a hangover kit full of goodies), a drink they can have as a nightcap (a petite bottle of whiskey with whiskey stones) or something they can have the next morning (artfully packaged bagels and schmear). It only adds to your guests' experience when they can sense that you've thought about the element of surprise along with their wants and needs long after the party.

"Three is a Trend: You Zig, I'll Zag","Usually, when Phoebe Bridgers talks about the moon, she's singing to a group of crying fans (I am, admittedly, one of them) who are mouthing the words to her ""Moon Song."" But last week, she could be found talking about astronomy in a not-heart-wrenching context—while wearing Chanel jewelry inspired by the stars. Standing underneath a crescent moon on a stage in Los Angeles, she introduced the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who were performing for Chanel’s guests at a dinner celebrating the launch of the 1932 jewelry collection, which is the second one ever released by the brand. The crowd cheered, but the 18-karat Coco Crush earrings and bracelet adorning Bridgers’s earlobes and wrist were beautiful enough that they could have elicited tears (of jealousy). Phoebe Bridgers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinIt has been 90 years since Gabrielle Chanel designed Bijoux de Diamants, the first high jewelry collection in history. It was created three years after Black Thursday pushed the world into the Great Depression, and Chanel was determined to create something that could shine through the turmoil. The 50-piece collection was made of white and yellow diamonds set in platinum and yellow gold, with 22 pieces inspired by specific constellations. “Nothing could be better for forgetting the crisis than feasting one’s eyes on beautiful new things,” she said of the collection. And so it feels fitting that in 2022, nearly three years after the entire world stood still for the pandemic, the fashion house she built would respond to our somber times with something just as sumptuous.More From Harper's BAZAARThe Yeah Yeah Yeahs performing at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinLike the original Bijoux de Diamants collection, the design of 1932 is harmonized around three symbols: the comet, the moon, and the sun. Chanel muses like Marion Cotillard, Lori Harvey, Greta Lee, and Whitney Peak were in attendance at the West Hollywood celebration, and, like Bridgers, were also layered in pieces from the 1932 collection named after the cosmos. Maggie Rogers at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection. Pat MartinSinger Maggie Rogers, who also recently graduated from Harvard’s Divinity School, wore five rings from the collection but said the shooting star Comète ear cuff in 18-karat gold was her favorite. On the Chanel black carpet, Rogers mentioned how she felt a kinship with Gabrielle over her affinity for outer space: “[The cosmos] is something that has always resonated with me and is very apparent and present in my musical work.” Gossip Girl’s Whitney Peak said the collection made her feel like a “superstar” before joking, “I feel like I shouldn’t be wearing it. I don’t know how they let me get away with this!” and then grasping the 1932 Comète Couture necklace in 18-karat gold and diamonds around her neck. Whitney Peak at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinWhile there are 77 pieces in the collection, its signature piece is the Allure Céleste necklace, with round-cut diamonds, an oval sapphire of deep blue, and a weight of 55.5 carats. What makes it extraordinary is its ability to transform: The halos detach to become brooches, and the central row of diamonds becomes a bracelet, converting the necklace into a shorter version. Thirteen other pieces from the 1932 collection also have the ability to transform in a similar manner, allowing the wearer to make new diamond constellations around their wrists and necks.Guests dining at the Chanel dinner to celebrate the 1932 high jewelry collection.Pat MartinMany of the pieces were made without clasps, something Gabrielle Chanel openly disliked. “I detest clasps! I’ve done away with clasps! Yet my jewelry is transformable,” she said in an interview in 1932 after the “Bijoux de Diamants” exhibition. She strived to design pieces that offered flexibility to busy women with full lives, and that didn’t impede their freedom. And as the jewelry-spangled guests left their cares behind to dance under a canopy of baby’s breath, it was evident that the new 1932 collection stays true to her vision.Tara GonzalezTara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.

Accessories Trend Report: Fall 2014,"Prada has never done things by the book. The brand has been creating the world's most desirable fashion pieces since their start over one hundred years ago, going from making humble leather goods to being one of the biggest privately owned brands in the world. Now, the brand is expanding on their aesthetic universe with a daring introduction into fine jewelry. The inaugural collection, titled ETERNAL GOLD, marks both a commitment to beauty and to sustainable, circular fashion.Maya Hawke for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsAs Prada's first-ever fine jewelry offering, ETERNAL GOLD is a first in many aspects. It's also the world's first fine jewelry collection made entirely with recycled gold, collected using the industry's most rigorous standards set by the Responsible Jewelry Council. Prada is also the first company to expand on diamond traceability, making every single carat count traceable down to its origins. The complete transparency of every material used in their jewelry, from sourcing to cutting to setting, is a radical step in the direction of honest production for an otherwise murky process. Somi Jeon for ETERNAL GOLDDavid SimsThe jewelry is a reflection of Prada's impact on the industry and a continuation of their efforts to creating beautiful objects that stands the test of time, as all fine jewelry should. ETERNAL GOLD is rife with Pradaisms, with the instantly recognizable Prada triangle rendered as sleek earrings and pendants, but also imbued in clasp closures, and more subtly, in chain links and as the head and tail of the snake bracelet.  The snake bracelet itself may at first recall other serpent bracelets, but finds its own voice with the sneaky Prada triangle and smooth, unvarnished gold. Heart pendants take on an edgy effect with the triangle chainlink it sits on.More From Harper's BAZAARCourtesyCourtesyPrada chose three voices of our time to don this foundational collection, representing where Prada is now and where it can go. Amanda Gorman, award-winning poet and activist, Maya Hawke, singer/songwriter, actress, and model, and Somi Jeon, musician, become one with the gold, immortalized in gold negative renderings by David Sims. The jewelry and its campaign represent the future of a wholly responsible planet that isn't sacrificing purity and beauty at its demise.

Three is a Trend: At the Rodeo,"Is any woman as synonymous with another creature as Mariah Carey is with a butterfly?This week, the singer celebrated the 30th anniversary of the release of her groundbreaking album Butterfly, and now she celebrates the arrival of her collaboration with the jeweler Chopard, which launches in stores and online today, September 16. The pieces, a mix of butterflies rendered in diamonds on rings, bracelets, earrings, and a breathtaking statement necklace, commemorate Carey’s  longtime affinity for the creature who helped her conceptualize her life as an independent artist at the top of a male-dominated music industry. She describes the process of seeing and wearing the pieces, while simultaneously celebrating “my favorite album that I’ve done,” as an emotional experience. “It’s a major moment, and it’s a full circle moment,” she says. Here she tells us about conceptualizing the collection, her daily jewelry wardrobe, and how she will wear the pieces.Harper’s Bazaar: I want to start by talking about this incredible butterfly necklace. Mariah Carey: Oh my gosh.HB: The butterfly, of course, is this incredibly significant symbol of transformation for you. But seeing the butterfly rendered in diamonds reminded me of how dazzling they are. They’re the most beautiful living creatures. And I wondered if you learned anything about the butterfly, seeing it rendered in diamonds. The enduring symbol of the butterfly—I mean, we can go on and on about different people's interpretations and feelings. My own personal feelings are so very specific to my album Butterfly and that period of my life, which we are celebrating the anniversary of this year, [coincidentally] at the same time that this is all happening, right? Because we've been working on this [with Chopard] for two years together, and it happened by accident [that] we’re re-releasing the Butterfly album, which is my favorite album that I’ve done.And yes, I have a very specific relationship with the butterfly and just the whole metamorphosis of it. The way that I had to come through a very difficult time in my life and, you know, like they say, you’ve gotta go through something to get something. I had to get to that place where I felt empowered enough to metaphorically fly and be free from that place where I was. I started out in this industry as such a young girl in a really difficult world, dominated by men. I wrote this song as I was leaving this mansion that I had paid for half of, and [where] I had sort of created my own little prison, not really deliberately, but it ended up feeling that way. And I was leaving and I wrote the lyrics and the melody to [the song “Butterfly”]: Spread your wings and prepare to fly / for you have become a butterfly. And so that’s always stuck with me. I’ve made many albums since then, but it’s just very specific to me. So to see this magnificent butterfly necklace, and the ring—I mean, it was so much to even be able to say, I collaborated on this. To be able to admire the craft—I don’t want to say “craftsmanship.” Please give me another word.HB: The creation, the artistry?The artistry! That’s what it is. Just to be able to collaborate with Chopard and doing this collection is a humongous honor. I’m just here, ready to put some diamonds on and hang out. Whatever! Courtesy of Chopard.HB: What is your daily jewelry wardrobe? Are we wearing the butterfly ring every day and the necklace for special occasions? Or is there a different routine here?I am not really one for routines of any sort. I’m not a dancer. I don’t really like to follow rules. So I would wear any piece on any occasion. But right now i’m wearing a bracelet that my daughter made for me that says “Lamily” on it, which is an homage to my fans made of little beads and elastic, with some diamond bracelets. I would wear any piece from the collection in a casual moment, or more specifically the Happy Butterfly collection, which I love so much. I think they’re gonna look gorgeous stacked with even just a T-shirt and jeans, leggings, a simple dress. There’s just really great pieces that are attainable, as well as those gorgeous—I don’t find them over the top, some might say they are; they’re major—pieces that I live for.They are really major. And they feel so you. I can see you wearing this incredible butterfly necklace with a T-shirt, or these enormous leaf earrings.I would do that! I’m so ready to wear those. When Caroline [Scheufele, the president of Chopard] was evolving and creating them, she was explaining them to me and I knew exactly what she meant, but when I saw them, I was losing it. I mean, they’re just sick. It’s beyond. They’re so good. [Laughs.]Sounds like you and Caroline had good chemistry.I feel like Caroline probably has incredible chemistry with anyone cuz she’s so fun and carefree. I love that about her. She’s also an artist and a businesswoman, and to work with her to make this collection together, [it feels] even more extra special because it was my idea and I was able to watch it happen.Courtesy of Chopard.Would you say it’s true that diamonds are a girl’s best friend?Well, considering the people I know, for sure. Maybe the exception of one or two. You know, at the end of the day, they’re not going to steer you wrong! Do you feel like jewelry plays an important part in your life spiritually? It can be armor, but it also reflects the essential feminine aspects of who you are.That’s interesting. I’ve never thought of it that way. There were little things, little pieces that I’ve had throughout my life, where they did have their own—I wouldn’t say spiritual, but they had a sort of special significance to me where I would keep them on no matter what. Swimming, whatever I was doing, I would keep them on. Because they were that special to me. And at one point I lost a piece of jewelry that I loved so much, and it wasn’t even that it was a major thing. It just meant something to me. But with this collection, everything means so much to me that I’m just excited to share it with the world.

""It made me appreciate silhouettes and cuts and color in a way I thought I had, but when you put it on camera, when you are trying to tell a story, you can see how clothing can do a lot of the work for you.""Of her personal wardrobe, she added, ""I love my T-shirts, and I love my vintage T-shirts.

Brand Watch: Gaydamak Jewelry,"Worn by celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, Kendall Jenner, Tracee Ellis Ross, Millie Bobby Brown, and more, the '90s- and Y2K-inspired braided tendril trend has only increased in popularity since its reemergence during the 2022 festival season. ""The tendril trend has always been an easy way to add a little 'razzle-dazzle' to any updo,"" Erinn Courtney, a natural hair expert at StyleSeat and celebrity stylist, tells BAZAAR.com. Typically crafted as a set of smaller, face-framing braids, braided tendrils are an easy way to elevate a go-to bun or ponytail. You can also quickly enhance a salon-quality blowout or beachy waves by adding a second pair of braids near the ears for a summery, carefree hair look.View full post on InstagramView full post on InstagramWhen it comes to the styling essentials needed for a braided tendril updo versus wearing your hair completely down, professionals say there isn't much difference in the products and tools to keep in your arsenal. ""Re-creating this look at home is pretty simple,"" says celebrity stylist and Mane Addicts artist Irinel de León, who counts stars like Bella Hadid, Chrissy Teigen, and Hailey Bieber as clients. ""You'll need a little gel, a tail comb, and two small rubber bands—more if you're looking to add braids throughout the hair as well.""Shop the Braided Tendril Hair TrendGoody Ouchless Women's Clear Elastic Hair Tie (250 Count)Now 33% Off$5 at AmazonCredit: AmazonOribe  Gel Serum Radiance$63 at oribe.comCredit: Oribeghd Tail Comb$22 at GHD HairCredit: ghdTancho High Grade Tique Vegetable Pomade in Lavender$20 at AmazonCredit: AmazonCreme of Nature Argan Oil Perfect Edges$5 at Sally BeautyCredit: Sally BeautyEvolve Perfect Edge BrushNow 50% Off$5 at AmazonCredit: Amazonslip  Pure Silk 6-Pack Skinny Scrunchies $39 at NordstromCredit: NordstromDe Leon recommends starting off the look by centering your hair down the middle and creating two triangular parts on the left- and right-hand sides.

""For updos in particular, I love using a little barber's brush to smooth hair into a cute bun or pony,"" she adds. ""I also recommend applying gel around the perimeter of the hair, brushing it upwards, then securing it with a hair tie.

Three is a Trend: Seeing Green,"Kendall Jenner's latest off-duty look goes back to the basics.Earlier this week, the reality TV star and model stepped out wearing an iteration of one of her classic summer uniforms. The ensemble was composed of sensible high-waisted straight-leg trousers in white and a salmon-colored cropped cardigan from Miaou. Jenner styled the look with this season's most covetable shoe option: the kitten heel. Her take on the trend involved an ivory pair resembling ballet flats and featuring the signature mini heels.For accessories, Jenner went subtle, opting for a black leather shoulder bag from The Row, skinny rectangular sunglasses, and a black belt.BACKGRIDSo far, the 818 founder's summer has been full of simple yet sophisticated looks like this one.Back in June, for instance, she put her own spin on the coastal grandmother trend by sporting a pair of powder-yellow shorts from Aritzia with a super-cropped gray tank top, plus a dusty-blue button-up from Almina Concept and a spacious black tote bag. In another outing, the model looked cool and casual in a black cami, a denim midi skirt from The Row, and a pair of black loafers, while flashing a bright orange wallet from Hermès.Jenner previously talked to BAZAAR.com about 818, her tequila brand.""It's been amazing to see how much 818 has accomplished in just over a year,"" she said in June. ""As we enter year two, I see 818 continuing to grow, engaging with our customers in new and interesting ways, and staying committed to our sustainability mission.

Three is a Trend: Haute Sweatshirts,"Ahead of the premiere of her much-awaited film Blonde, in which she portrays Marilyn Monroe, Ana de Armas is diving into a world Monroe knew quite a lot about: diamonds.The film and fashion icon famously sang ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" in the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and was known for her elegant style and love of high jewelry (remember when she wore the spectacular yellow diamond necklace dubbed The Moon of Baroda?). At the time, however, the diamond industry was seen as untouchable and unreachable for both ordinary buyers and small jewelry designers, and only big names, such as De Beers and Tiffany & Co., got the business and the notoriety. At the same time, conflict diamonds and diamond smuggling became real problems.Now, the Natural Diamond Council, along with brand ambassador de Armas, is looking to change that by backing young designers from around the world and educating buyers on the current state of the industry, which is moving toward a more sustainable and inclusive future.More From Harper's BAZAAR""I started working with the NDC in 2020, and I think it was a process for me of learning,"" de Armas tells BAZAAR.com at the NDC's launch event on June 14 at the Beekman Hotel penthouse in New York City, adding that she got to see how women in Botswana ran diamond mines and handled tractors, and essentially got to know the community behind the precious stones.    Vincenzo DiminoOn Tuesday, the NDC debuted the collections of the second class of artists from its Emerging Designers Diamond Initiative, which launched in January 2021 with $1 million of diamond credit dedicated to supporting emerging BIPOC jewelry designers, in partnership with Lorraine Schwartz.Per the NDC, ""The diamond industry is historically a generational and handshake industry where emerging designers without prior connections often experience barriers to entry. The program sets to level the playing field by providing direct, career-lasting relationships with diamantaires by underwriting $1 million in diamond credit in the designers’ own names. Industry education and resources, mentor pairings, and financial support for production and CAD designs are NDC’s efforts to help create a more equitable future.""Vincenzo DiminoDe Armas, wearing a brilliant ring and necklace from Dorian Webb and a ring from Heart the Stones by Halle Millien, says it's powerful the way in which the NDC is supporting—and financially backing—artists in the community who need the space to simply do what they're good at.""As a minority myself, I remember the days when I just wanted the chance to be in the room. I wanted to just be there. Give me the opportunity and I'll show you what I can offer,"" de Armas says. ""The fact that they're mentoring and supporting and opening the doors to relationships and careers and resources for these guys and giving them the credit is incredible.""The Cuban actress is no stranger to red-carpet glamour, and she has been dripped in diamonds for roles several times over the course of her film career, but she says the passion and originality of the up-and-coming jewelry designers' diamond pieces prove there are still ways to break boundaries in the diamond world.""It's the new generations who are going to bring a new take on jewelry. We don't have to keep wearing or interpreting jewelry in the same way,"" she says.Vincenzo DiminoJewelry, and diamonds in particular, the actress agrees, can be incredibly personal. They can be much more than just beautiful, high-priced pieces we like to look at. A jewelry collection can be passed down for generations, it can carry different meanings and morph and be modernized through the years—take Duchess Kate's inherited jewelry from Princess Diana, for example.De Armas says there is one piece she bought herself that she cherishes above all others: an antique ring that reminds her of her grandmother.""I had a ring from my grandma that I'm pretty sure was not a diamond, but it was this dark red stone with little things around it, and I lost it at the airport and I was so, so, so, so sad,"" she recalls in a conversation with BAZAAR. ""And years went by, and then I was shooting a movie and we were shooting on the street and I bumped into an antique store and I found the version of that ring—same color, but this time real diamonds—and I had to get it. It wasn't my grandma's ring, but it just reminds me of her. I have it here, actually, because I always wear it."" Maybe not as meaningful but equally dazzling were the jewels de Armas got to wear while filming the 2021 James Bond film No Time to Die with Daniel Craig.""That was beautiful—such an incredible touch for the character. Everything was so simple but I just felt like the jewelry really matched her personality: so sparkly and shiny and happy,"" de Armas says.Vincenzo DiminoWalking around the NDC event, where the young designers showcased their diamond creations, the actress couldn't keep her eyes off Birthright Foundry's Heritage Diamond Ula Nifo choker, crafted from 18-karat yellow gold and natural white diamonds but inspired by whale tooth necklaces from Samoa. The Ula Nifo necklace was worn by Samoan chiefs and their children in ancient times, and signified wealth and status, designer Constance Polamalu explains.""It's just so different,"" de Armas says.Grant Mobley, a diamond and fine jewelry expert at the NDC, tells BAZAAR how rare and exciting it is to see a high-jewelry piece so influenced by a designer's underrepresented culture, and yet so wearable today.""If you think back to these incredible Samoan jewelry designs with the amazing necklace collars from well over 100 years ago, she's turning that into something that makes sense for the modern day, and she's also doing that with fine jewelry materials: gold, diamonds,"" he says. ""It's something that might've been worn hundreds of years ago by her ancestors, but she's making it something that she would wear and that you would see on the red carpet.""The collections of the latest EDDI class of designers—Casey Perez, Corey Anthony Jones, Lana Ogilvie (Sabre Jewelry), Mckenzie Liautaud, Halle Millien (Heart the Stones), and Ruben Manuel—will launch this Friday, June 17, on 1stDibs.

Trending Now... Cat Call,"Lately I wonder if we’re living through a mass psychosis expressing itself through trend reporting. If it felt a year ago like anything goes—that the restrictions and trauma of the pandemic highlighted fashion and self-expression as a new outlet for freedom—increasingly it seems that there are a thousand trends happening at once. In just the past month, I have read stories about a new twist on the girlboss trend called “that girl,” a trend in which women really enjoy themselves, and a trend in which women enjoy themselves a little, plus “dinocore,” “clowncore,” and “twee.” On TikTok, trend forecasting has become the new influencer hustle, almost a trend itself; creators who can string together photographic evidence with a pithy and compelling monologue are performing a kind of competitive prophecy. And the platform’s algorithm seems to favor this sort of information sharing: the more ridiculous the prediction, the more traction it gains, and the more predictions we are fed. In the meantime, fast fashion brands like Shein have sped production to such a pace that they can both predict and reflect these trends, making them feel all the more real while we ping pong through “feels” and “vibes” with no aesthetic compass. Even runway fashion, which is supposed to move at a slower, biannual speed, has joined this rat race, as designers pack their shows with potential viral moments and styles that are replicable by anyone with a little ingenuity and a pair of scissors. The tempo of fashion makes everything feel quick, carefree, and, sometimes, unfortunately, even careless. Mostly it seems that people are doing things humans have done for most of the past century—relaxing, working hard, having martinis, not having martinis—but now we cannot resist the urge to package them into something that feels more meaningful than mere consumer choices.Jerry Lorenzo, the 44-year-old designer behind the brand Fear of God, is a man who has started many trends himself (real trends, that is). When he began his brand almost a decade ago, it was a luxury cornerstone of the hypebeast movement, which often encourages a cut-throat, product-driven style of consumerism. Lorenzo worked on an early season of Yeezy alongside then-Vetements designer Demna, and, after making T-shirts for Justin Bieber’s “Purpose” tour, helped turn merch into meaningful clothes. He was a close friend of and collaborator with the late Virgil Abloh, whose brand Off-White propelled streetwear to the forefront of fashion, and his sneakers and sweatpants remain staples in hip corridors of Los Angeles and New York. But lately, Lorenzo has been on a different kind of fashion journey. In early 2020 he collaborated with Ermenegildo Zegna’s Alessandro Sartori for a collection that shifted menswear’s inner circle’s attitude around suiting, making it feel less performative and more like a staple. And now his collections, which arrive on his own time rather than seasonally, serve a slower, even higher purpose. Today, he is releasing a new collection, his first in nearly two years. As he worked on it, he said in a video interview late last week, he asked himself of every garment, “Is this timeless?”“I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now,” he said. “And I want to provide a safe space for someone that wants to step outside of that, but can still step into that conversation with everyone else that’s of ‘the now’ and feel of ‘the now,’ but not have to be so on trend.” Instead, what he wants his clothing to do is help his customers “feel the confidence. I want them to feel sophisticated, but I want them to feel the freedom to be themselves and know that it’s not the trend that validates you. It’s the individual that you are.” Lorenzo calls this collection Eternal. And while the clothing is a natural progression of the easy elegance of the collections he dropped in late summer and fall of 2020, it seems quite radical, to me, to proclaim you want to defy the trend cycle and try to make something that has lasting value. It seems so obvious, to try to float above it all, and yet the intoxicating quest for relevance has made it a rare impulse. Lorenzo is almost dipping into the realm of slow fashion—of designers with far less recognizable names who rarely stage fashion shows, like the 19th-century inspired work of Paul Harnden, the simple French cottons of Casey Casey, or the heady beauty of Elena Dawson. They make clothing that is intentionally hard to find and difficult to make. Lorenzo hasn’t gone that far, of course, and he has in his corner the fact that his clothing is meant to make you feel as comfortable in a suit as you are in your favorite sweatshirt. That means it has the potential to transcend the cognoscenti customer of slow fashion brands, or perhaps convert recovering hypebeasts into cognoscenti. He is designing with incredible thoughtfulness, even integrity–almost like a novel. “I approach it like a book or a music album,” said Lorenzo of putting together collections. “I don't really approach it in terms of seasons and seasonality. I approach it like, Hey, do I have something to say? Do I have the resources to say what I wanna say in the best way?” He remains independently owned–he also has a partnership with Adidas, where he serves as the head of strategy for their basketball category—and his resources are just catching up to his point of view, as he put it. He’s been able to move 80% of his production to Italy, for example. “And so hopefully each time we have something to say, it’s better than the last thing we said.” Lorenzo, of course, isn’t the only designer to prize continual improvement over novelty. The Row’s Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen come to mind, and Lorenzo, like The Row and other influential American aesthetes, is particularly drawn, lately, to the 1980s and ’90s designs of Giorgio Armani. His cascades of beige in flowing, almost spiritually understated cuts wrote a new script for minimalism. If Prada was cerebral, edgy, and obscure, and Calvin Klein was sexy, Armani was, just as Lorenzo said, a man of confidence, whose clothing blessed its wearers with a feeling of monastic chic weightlessness. “I do feel inundated with trends and color and graphics and so much of now.”In Eternal, the cuts are generous without swamping their wearer in fabric; the tones are bones, milky beiges, and greyish whites; and nearly all the pants blur the line between a structured trouser and a cozy sweatpant. You can see how a person dressed in these clothes might calm a room of investors or subtly change the energy in a coffee shop line. “I am in fashion, and I do love to present myself a certain way,” Lorenzo mused. “But that’s always been something that is understated. It’s always been something that isn’t loud and doesn’t call for attention. As quiet as I want to be in a room, I also want to be competent, you know?” Like Armani—and again, like The Row—Lorenzo is thinking about how his clothing might provide solutions, not only to the holes in your wardrobe but to your own questions about your sense of self. How do you wear a suit, which has different proportions and fabrics than a hoodie or track pants, and still feel like yourself? “That’s what I’m always chasing, you know? How can I be always sophisticated in the way that I present myself, but honest, and relaxed and comfortable?” Lorenzo’s evolution as a designer over the past decade, from a Los Angeles DJ to a new hero in intentional clothing creation, has been one of fashion’s most interesting. By staying independent, he’s allowed himself the time to grow and explore that investors or big luxury house appointments rarely afford. Too often, a designer’s references are too readily apparent, too surface—Ralph Lauren’s Polo line, or Annie Leibowitz’s images for The Gap, or the wackadoo spirit of 1980s couture that seems to have captured the imagination of many young womenswear designers in New York. In fact, prior to his dalliance with Zegna, Lorenzo spoke about wanting to build a brand like Lauren’s. But Lorenzo has a new modesty about him, and his clothing feels intimate in a way that Lauren’s, which is much more like a worshipful encyclopedia of American style, simply cannot. We talked about how opting out of trendiness can be quite boring—depending on how many viscose trouser-wearing influencers you follow on Instagram, you might say it’s even something of a trend itself—and how he’s tweaked his pieces, and played with fabrics, to give his pieces some heart and some personality. Changing the shoulder on a jacket from a past collection to make it feel less 1980s, for example. The result is that these are real clothes, for someone who is not trying to create a look for a moment in time, but who believes fashion can improve your life in small but significant ways.Open GalleryRachel TashjianRachel Tashjian is the Fashion News Director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.

Tiffany and Co.Taylor-Joy's gown for the evening was embellished with two of the luxury jeweler's Elsa Peretti Diamonds by the Yard platinum necklaces elegantly draped down the actress's back— a mesmerizing look that was inspired by classic movie stars from Old Hollywood's past. She also wore platinum diamond starburst earrings, a yellow sapphire and baguette diamond bracelet from the brand's Blue Book Collection, and two major statement rings: an over-17-carat yellow sapphire diamond and a stunning platinum vine-shaped ring.  Tiffany and Co.Tiffany and Co.The actress's breathtaking beauty look for the night was equally dramatic, with Taylor Joy opting for a matte complexion, flushed cheeks, neutral eye shadow, wispy lashes, and vibrant red lips. She wore her hair in a vintage-inspired, delicately styled bouffant, but added a modern, kitschy touch with a bright-yellow manicure as well. Taylor-Joy's red-carpet look was easily one of the standouts of the evening, winning over social media and best-dressed lists alike (including ours) for its fresh and timeless approach to red-carpet style and glamour.

Smart Shopping: Gold Dynasty,"MoAna Luu has spent her professional life building brands, from designing boutique hotels to serving as chief content and creative officer at Essence. But after contracting Covid-19 in March 2020, Luu decided to refocus on a new brand-building effort—one that’s entirely her own. That project is ManLuu, a line of luxury jewelry paying homage to Luu’s Creole heritage—a blend of African, Indian, French, and Caribbean traditions—and Martinique’s long tradition of jewelry-making. ManLuu arrives today at Nordstrom for its official, 21-item debut following a soft online launch this summer. ManLuu is composed of gender neutral earrings, bracelets, and rings in 18k gold vermeil and sterling silver. Nods to Creole jewelry tradition emerge through ManLuu’s use of exaggerated geometric shapes and signature woven patterns (an octagonal hoop with webbed inlays here, a chunky beaded bracelet there). ""The craftsmanship is something that is so delicate, when you see it you know you have a precious piece already,"" Luu says.More From Harper's BAZAARSome of the designer's earliest introductions to Creole craftsmanship came from her grandparents’ jewelry store in Fort-de-France, Martinique, Luu tells BAZAAR.com. But ManLuu’s devotion to quality is inspired by even earlier references, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. At that time, Black people could not become property owners, so they invested in gold jewelry heirlooms to pass down among generations. Luu says that ManLuu shares the power of this story, one that many people may not know, through each piece.MoAna Luu at the ManLuu atelier in New York City.ManLuuManLuu’s interpretation of heirloom jewelry had resonated long before this week’s Nordstrom launch. Gwyneth Paltrow, Mary J. Blige, and Maye Musk are a few of its early fans. Cardi B. even wore ManLuu bangles to announce her second pregnancy earlier this year—a special stamp of approval for the brand, Luu tells us. Joining forces with a large retailer like Nordstrom is, in some ways, even more significant than those celebrity endorsements. ""As a Black female designer and founder, I believe it's important that heritage brands welcome new creators and support them taking their place in the luxury market,"" Luu explains. ""This is a big step, not just for me, but for all of us.""While ManLuu's approach to luxury references centuries-old jewelry traditions, its use of eco-friendly materials is thoroughly 2021. Many pieces are crafted with recycled metals; later on, ManLuu will also incorporate lab-grown diamonds. Luu couldn't imagine starting a new label without incorporating conscious design techniques: “Sustainability is something that, today, is mandatory in any business."" By balancing meaningful history with modern design, ManLuu is an alternative to the throwaway jewelry sold, well, nearly everywhere. “Fast fashion was nice,” Luu says, “but now it’s time for pieces you want to keep.” And one day, pass down.Shop Manluu at NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$770 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Classic Beaded Necklace$2,650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Open Ring$600 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Cuff Bracelet$2,800 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$370 at NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$900 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Ear Jackets$1,000 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Hoop Earrings$570 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Embossed Ring$650 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Long Beaded Necklace$4,200 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Cane Maxi Ring$470 at NordstromCredit: NordstromManLuu Beaded Bracelet$1,100 at NordstromCredit: NordstromHalie LeSavageHalie LeSavage is the fashion commerce editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, where she covers everything from emerging designers to viral products to must-shop sales events.

Seeing Yellow: Shop Summer's Coolest Sunglass Trend,"No one can take a time-out from the Y2K fashion revival. Not even our iPhones. Like bucket hats and platform flip flops before them, phone straps of the early aughts variety are having a renaissance. Think of these attachable lanyards like the camp jewelry trend, but for your phone. The plainest phone straps start with rainbow-colored resin beads and get kitschier from there. Entire indie brands are dedicated to beaded phone straps, with String Ting, GriGri, and Hang On credited in mirror selfies across Instagram. Established accessories players are catching on, with versions appearing at Roxanne Assoulin and Lele Sadoughi. View full post on InstagramAlex Bass, founder at phone strap seller Hang On, says Y2K nostalgia is a big part of her brand. Hang On’s aesthetic harkens back to the days when cell phones were a novelty and personalizing them was a compulsion—the more glitter, the better. In Bass’s case, she stuck “stickers and rhinestones on every square centimeter of the phone, à la Carrie Bradshaw.”More From Harper's BAZAARBut there’s more to the phone strap trend than 2000 calling to give our lucky charms back,  String Ting founder Rachel Steed-Middleton tells BAZAAR.com. “The ‘smartphone-is-my-life’ way of being is more current and of the times, so this is really a very new and modern-day category of accessorizing,” she says.

Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, and Kaia Gerber have all been spotted with String Tings dangling from their phones.“Being more connected to our devices naturally makes us think about what they look like and how we can personalize them,” Bass agrees. “With Hang On, we’ve tried to capitalize on this trend but also reshape its narrative.” The brand offers two-for-one discounts on its charms—to encourage shoppers to buy one for a friend, and remind them to stay in touch.

The Best Fall Nail Trends To Try Now,"Thanks to an early passion for vintage fashion, jewelry designer Pamela Love knows her way around sartorial classics. For her, shopping isn't just about finding things that are aesthetically pleasing; instead, she looks for elegant pieces with eye-catching details and rich backstories. ""Finding a great vintage item is like winning the lottery. It's completely unique and special and has a story behind it,"" she says. Here, Love takes us on a vintage shopping excursion at Brooklyn's Amarcord, explaining what she's always hunting for and why clothing can sometimes take a backseat to stunning jewelry.From: ELLE US"
Rihanna Looks Gorgeous in a Sheer Gown and Gold Body Jewelry,"Katie Kova is petite, quietly spoken, and very chic (think simple, understated style that conveys a quiet sort of elegance). Her newly launched fine jewelry label, Kova, follows in much the same vein. ""My jewelry is 100% wearable, stackable, mixable, and day-to-night viable,"" she says. ""I wear it with a T-shirt and flats and with a cocktail dress and stilettos.""Inspired by the 20th-century Russian art movement Suprematism (invented by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich, it was one of the earliest and most radical developments in abstract art), Kova's pieces possess the same sort of graphic, linear construction and minimalist feel as her favorite artworks. An ear cuff features circles and zig zag lines embedded with dozens of black and white pave diamonds, while a pair of triangular earrings have slight differences in each side. ""At Kova we see jewelry as a form of wearable creation,"" she says. ""We begin with analysis, researching shapes, lines, concepts, references, textures, inspirations, fits, and even variable degrees of shine—that´s how nerdy we can be. It´s all about the conceptual and creative challenges of launching a line that's cohesive, unique, and by all means; beautiful."" Sally GriffithsFor the Moscow-born, London-based designer, jewelry wasn't her first calling. Rather, she studied business before leaping into the world of accessories. ""I always knew that I´d start my own project and that it would be a creative one. Even when I was studying business I was interested in architecture and design,"" she explains. ""Jewelry is my true passion. The minute my grandfather gave me my first piece of jewelry when I was 14, I became an ad hoc jewelry researcher. Kova is the result of that informal education and my very formal business studies."" And while her homeland provides much of the inspiration, Kova's London base also delivers plenty of influences. ""Russia gave me a vast cultural legacy: The unparalleled graphic influence of artists Rodchenko, Malevich, and Kandinsky—to name just three. London on the other hand stimulated my creativity as an individual. It´s a city of creativity, talent, and brains that has made my vision so much more versatile.""More From Harper's BAZAARHer sculptural, minimalist pieces are also a step away from traditional fine jewelry, especially those that she grew up around. ""In Russia, fine jewelry is passed from generation to generation so it´s highly valued. Collecting fine jewelry has been a tradition in my family for generations. My favorite piece is the Tiffany & Co. bracelet that my grandfather gave me when I was 14. I still wear it all the time. It's not about trends, it´s about design integrity and the best stones."" In a rapidly changing accessories market, Kova's pieces personify a new approach to fine jewelry—unlike traditional fine jewels there's no need to keep them locked in a vault or only worn on special occasions. ""Women today understand fine jewelry as a wearable accessory rather than just an investment,"" agrees Kova. Her own personal approach to fashion and style is indicative of the change. ""I am not a girly girl but I´m not masculine either. I appreciate femininity but not in its literal instance. You won´t see me in ruffles and bows, you'll see me in pieces that are understated and elegant. I love wearing clothes that empower you, that give you confidence.""Read more from Tara from PROFYLES.com."
