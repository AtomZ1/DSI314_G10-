      "[\"As the Twitter joke goes, the Met Gala is the one night of the year where we all get to judge celebrities' looks while we lounge around in stained sweatpants. And while it's all too common for some to slouch when it comes to following the theme of the night, one guest nailed it in the gilded glamor department at the 2022 Met Gala. Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers. It was shiny gold and covered in ruby and pearl-looking appliqués. She also sported a gold, armor-esque covering on her other pointer finger. The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore. Somehow, it was both a retro and futuristic look all at once. And one that set the hearts of internet critics aflame.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.King kept the rest of her beauty look simple, with cropped hair and minimal-looking makeup. Because why take attention away from the nail situation? It's especially impressive to see the manicure from far away, where you can really notice how long it is.Best of luck to King if she wants to pick anything up today —those nails won't make it easy — but we do appreciate a spiced-up manicure that follows the evening's trend.

If that wasn\\'t enough, the \"Kiss Me More\" singer made our jaws drop with the stunning Schiaparelli black gown and gold accessories she wore for the awards show. By now we expect the pop star to capture our attention with every new look, but we didn\\'t expect her to show up to the event with short nails or intricate gold rings that look like they\\'re worth more than my student loans.The \"Say So\" singer didn\\'t hesitate to take risks for this look, something we love from her. Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas gave her a neutral smokey eye with a hint of bright yellow on the inner crease and waterline that complemented the daring gown very well. As for her hair, hairstylist Jared Henderson (known as JStay Ready to many) slicked her dark hair into a high ponytail with a flipped end that we have a good feeling was fun to whip around.Getty ImagesTypically Doja Cat wears lengthy nails, but for this look, she kept them short. Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe. But this manicure is anything but simple, because this opulent jewelry is basically nail art.Her middle finger had the largest ring, which covered her entire finger and nail. The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own. The other two rings were simpler, which is saying something.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one!

The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me.

I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade. As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says. More than a few modeling paychecks later (thank you, Kim\\'s Skims, Rihanna\\'s Savage x Fenty, Victoria\\'s, well, Victoria\\'s Secret), the 23-year-old did just that. Helen Harris crafted her a set of open windows in gold for the bottom and dueling statement gems on top.

Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers. It was shiny gold and covered in ruby and pearl-looking appliqués. She also sported a gold, armor-esque covering on her other pointer finger. The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore. Somehow, it was both a retro and futuristic look all at once.

Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe. But this manicure is anything but simple, because this opulent jewelry is basically nail art.Her middle finger had the largest ring, which covered her entire finger and nail. The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one!

The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me.

One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade. As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says.

And while it's all too common for some to slouch when it comes to following the theme of the night, one guest nailed it in the gilded glamor department at the 2022 Met Gala. Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers. It was shiny gold and covered in ruby and pearl-looking appliqués. She also sported a gold, armor-esque covering on her other pointer finger. The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore. Somehow, it was both a retro and futuristic look all at once. And one that set the hearts of internet critics aflame.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.King kept the rest of her beauty look simple, with cropped hair and minimal-looking makeup.

If that wasn\\'t enough, the \"Kiss Me More\" singer made our jaws drop with the stunning Schiaparelli black gown and gold accessories she wore for the awards show. By now we expect the pop star to capture our attention with every new look, but we didn\\'t expect her to show up to the event with short nails or intricate gold rings that look like they\\'re worth more than my student loans.The \"Say So\" singer didn\\'t hesitate to take risks for this look, something we love from her. Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas gave her a neutral smokey eye with a hint of bright yellow on the inner crease and waterline that complemented the daring gown very well. As for her hair, hairstylist Jared Henderson (known as JStay Ready to many) slicked her dark hair into a high ponytail with a flipped end that we have a good feeling was fun to whip around.Getty ImagesTypically Doja Cat wears lengthy nails, but for this look, she kept them short. Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe. But this manicure is anything but simple, because this opulent jewelry is basically nail art.Her middle finger had the largest ring, which covered her entire finger and nail. The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one! What else can we pierce?Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"And then it literally never healed. The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me.

One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade. As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says. More than a few modeling paychecks later (thank you, Kim\\'s Skims, Rihanna\\'s Savage x Fenty, Victoria\\'s, well, Victoria\\'s Secret), the 23-year-old did just that. Helen Harris crafted her a set of open windows in gold for the bottom and dueling statement gems on top.

The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore.

Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one!

The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me.

One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade. As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces.

And while it's all too common for some to slouch when it comes to following the theme of the night, one guest nailed it in the gilded glamor department at the 2022 Met Gala. Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers. It was shiny gold and covered in ruby and pearl-looking appliqués. She also sported a gold, armor-esque covering on her other pointer finger. The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore. Somehow, it was both a retro and futuristic look all at once. And one that set the hearts of internet critics aflame.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.King kept the rest of her beauty look simple, with cropped hair and minimal-looking makeup.

Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas gave her a neutral smokey eye with a hint of bright yellow on the inner crease and waterline that complemented the daring gown very well.

Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe. But this manicure is anything but simple, because this opulent jewelry is basically nail art.Her middle finger had the largest ring, which covered her entire finger and nail. The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah!

The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me.

One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade. As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says. More than a few modeling paychecks later (thank you, Kim\\'s Skims, Rihanna\\'s Savage x Fenty, Victoria\\'s, well, Victoria\\'s Secret), the 23-year-old did just that. Helen Harris crafted her a set of open windows in gold for the bottom and dueling statement gems on top.

Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers.

The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore.

Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one!

The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me.

One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade. As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants.

As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold.

Yep, it\\'s equally as disappointing when you find an eye-catching set of earrings only to find it\\'s made of materials that could irritate your skin. Sure, they say pain is beauty, but when that pain involves itchiness, redness, and uncomfortable rashes (on an already-thin and sensitive part of your skin, no less), it begs the question: \"were these hoops really worth it?\" The short answer is, well, no.And remember: you\\'ll know if your piercing is infected if it\\'s red, inflamed, sore, hot to touch, or if it\\'s releasing puss.

All around me were people filling in or touching up their ink, but I continued onward past the buzzing needles — straight to the back, where the piercer works. After a tough year, I was ready for a bit of body modification to memorialize the challenges and symbolize the jump forward into 2022. What I didn\\'t realize, as I asked for a third lobe piercing to continue to build my stack of hoops, is that my bright idea was of a pace with a wide new piercing trend.More and more customers are asking for what Alaina Rothstein, cofounder of Los Angeles ear piercing service Leo West, refers to as a \"milestone piercing.\" Rothstein has seen mothers and daughters come in for birthday piercing; she knows of a woman who miscarried and got a stud to remind her of the loss. \"It\\'s a fun, really beautiful way to carry something special with you in happy times and in sad times,\" she says. \"And I think it\\'s like super cool that it\\'s translated [from the tattoo world] into the piercing world.\"Our piercers have seen birthdays, bachelorette parties, and groups of friends come in to celebrate together. But what trends are they trying, specifically? In other words, which parts of the ear are getting the most adoration through adornment right now?Meet the experts:Alaina Rothstein and Jill Katz, RN, cofounders of Los Angeles ear-piercing service Leo WestLisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a piercing studio with locations in New York, Texas, and California (among others)Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer at Live by the Sword Tattoo in Brooklyn, New YorkIn This Story:Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?How to Pick Your PiercerConstellation PiercingsStacked LobesVertical StacksForward HelixSnakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)ConchOuter Conch, a.k.a.

That experimentation shows up both in the amount of piercings and in the piercings themselves, which are getting \"more creative,\" Bubbers says. (Plus, as Rothstein points out, \"one fun thing about mask-wearing is that your ears show.\")The last \"really important trend,\" as Leo West cofounder Jill Katz, RN describes it, is \"adorning what you got.\" There\\'s no normal, she says. A gorgeous earscape is all about working with your budget and your anatomy to create an embodiment of your style in tiny, beautiful silver, gold, or gem form.The result: forward helices, vertically stacked lobes, conches, sconches, snake bites, and plenty of other piercing types we never knew existed, spanning from the outer rims of the ear to the inner cartilage and back to the earlobe. Our trend-spotting piercers shared the adornments they\\'ve seen grow more popular over 2022, and what they envision for the years (and ears!) to come.How to Pick Your PiercerJust as with microblading, filler, or any other body modification, it\\'s important to find a professional piercer that you trust, with a style that appeals to you. This is an essential step, whether you’re a longtime body modification fan or it’s your first piercing ever.As Brooks notes, the benefit of following a piercer on social media is that you can seek them out and, as in one service she offers, put your ear(s) in her hands. During a \"curation\" appointment, the expert will look at your ear as a whole and help design multiple piercings to fit your style and your desires.At Leo West, that might look like getting multiple differentiated piercings on each ear. \"Symmetry is out,\" says Rothstein. As she points out, a specialist is extra helpful if you\\'re nervous about curating an asymmetrical look. \"It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t want ears that match, but it has to have a rhyme or reason to it,\" she says. \"I have two ears, and I like to say ‘one’s a little bit classy, one\\'s a little bit sassy.\\'\"Constellation PiercingsInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhile some of this year\\'s trends include holes in unexpected places, more of them involve third, fourth, or fifth additions to an already-pierced ear. At Leo West, the result is what they\\'ve named a \"constellation.\" A constellation consists of \"really small pieces, close together, closer than what your traditional spacing would be,\" explains Rothstein. The result is an \"intentionally random\" grouping of ear piercings that show off studs and gems.Stacked LobesInstagram user @leowestco\"People often come in [to the studio] and say \\'I’m not cool enough,\\'\" for a trendy piercing, recounts Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer in Brooklyn. If you\\'re intimidated by the thought of a conch piercing or even a constellation, Brooks thinks that an ear stack is an easier entry point. These piercings are less painful than their cartilage-filled brethren, and can make their way up the lobe either evenly spaced or placed close together.Vertical StacksInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"If I\\'m being honest, I love to put my hair behind my ear to show the little pops of pieces sitting right above your classic [piercing],\" laughs Rothstein. She\\'s referring to a vertical stack, which entails a piercing centered directly above your traditional first or second hole. It\\'s usually filled with a small stone or a small star, Rothstein\\'s favorite. This piercing does require a certain amount of space on the lobe, but if you have enough canvas to play with, it \"gives the ear a little extra uniqueness.\"Forward Helixcourtesy of StudsThe official name for that bouncy piece of cartilage where your ear meets your skull is the \"forward helix.\" According to Bubbers, customers are coming in requesting one or even multiple piercings on the forward helix. \"We do see new and different piercing trends emerge each year based on what’s trending in fashion, culture, and celebrity,\" she says. Celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Chantal Jeffries have helped popularize the new (and finicky — helix piercings can take up to nine months to heal) style.Snakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)In the realm of body piercing, the term \"snakebite\" typically refers to two piercings on either side of your lower lip, oftentimes barbells or studs.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen it comes to ears, however, it entails two holes placed close together, slightly separated from the rest of your ear piercings, giving the impression of that your piercer just might have used two fangs to get the job done. According to Bubbers, most customers opt for a snakebite in their “midi,\" the center point of the outer ear.ConchInstagram user @leowestcoWe\\'ve named conch piercings as of-trend for the past few years, but the cartilage piercing is still popular enough to remain on the list. It pierces through the inner-ear cartilage that makes up the back of the year. At Studs, Bubbers says customers are opting more and more for a snakebite on the conch for a doubly trendy effect.Outer Conch (Sometimes Known as a \"Sconch\")courtesy of Studs\"I hope you don\\'t use this name,\" laughs Brooks. She prefers the more medical-sounding \"outer conch,\" but the phrase \"sconch\" is catching on to describe a piercing placed at the lining ridge in the cavern space close to the center of the ear.\"It\\'s right in your eye-line when people look at you,\" she says, so it provides a way to show a bit of personality even when you\\'re on Zoom or wearing a mask. Because it\\'ll be eye-catching no matter what kind of earring(s) you have in, Brooks likes adorning an outer conch piercing with a piece of jewelry that makes a big statement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesMore on the world of piercings:How Tongue Piercings Work, From Pain Level and Placement to Aftercare and Healing TimeHow to Remove Every Type of Piercing at Home8 Types of Ear Piercings, ExplainedContraconch Ear Piercings Are Gaining Popularity for Its Unexpected PlacementIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?

That way, I have a scent memory anchored to that destination or time period for whenever I choose to relive it. My last international trip, to a prestigious wellness resort in Austria for some on-the-ground reporting, demanded a very specific choice: something compact enough to fit in my carry-on without getting tossed by TSA, calming enough to match the vibe of the Alpine oasis, and extra long-lasting so it would last through hikes, meals, and medical treatments without reapplication. Lastly, it would need to smell expensive, because my fellow wellness-seekers would expect as much — but we\\'ll get to that later.After much deliberation, I landed on a luxe new formula that had just hit my desk before my flight: the Jennifer Fisher My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil.My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil$65I was initially surprised that Jennifer Fisher, a jewelry designer beloved by her red carpet clientele and the master behind some of Jennifer Lopez\\'s favorite hoop earrings, had ventured into perfumery. That said, fragrance does feel like a sparkling accessory that amps up any outfit or beauty look, and Fisher wanted her new perfume oil to make a statement for the wearer. \"I want anyone wearing My Scent to feel confident and sexy,\" she tells Allure. “And to smell like a fresh baked cookie.\" Upon first wear, I didn\\'t flag baked goods as a top note, but I did instantly fall for the vanilla and coconut Fisher knew she wanted to include in the formula.\"The blend of vanilla and coconut brings back memories from my childhood growing up in Santa Barbara, California,\" she says. \"For years, I was combining different vanilla and coconut fragrances to try and create my own personal scent. Finding a scent that was a combination of surf wax from the beaches in my hometown, Montecito, and a fresh baked cookie is what I\\'ve always wanted.\"Australian sandalwood, pear, and Tonka bean flank the creamy hero notes, and it all comes together to smell equal parts sunny and cozy, like throwing on a cashmere sweater on a breezy summer night. Toting it around is just as effortless too: I carried the teeny-tiny rollerball in my airplane carry-on, my spa robe to and from massages and lunch, and even in my fanny pack while Nordic walking in the mountains.No, really, I took this tube everywhere with me.\\nTaylore Glynn\"I wanted to come out with something small, compact, and portable you could throw in your bag and take everywhere with you,\" says Fisher. \"A spray to me didn\\'t feel as transportable, but that doesn\\'t mean I am ruling it out for the next product. This oil was designed intentionally to be worn and carried on-the-go.\" In addition to being totable, the formula also fulfilled my need for something that would last through spa treatments and saunas.\"Coconut is a good oil carrier to round out scents,\" says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, noting that scent can last longer in oil form because it\\'s not watered down. \"Atomized scents usually contain alcohol to help spraying. Fragrance oil is the most concentrated form [you can find].\"The scent was so powerful that even my fellow resort guests noticed. In fact, I was flagged down multiple times in the dining room and in the halls to reveal what I was wearing because it smelled \"beautiful\" and \"divine.\" For important context, some of the resort guests on the premises at the time — who I can\\'t explicitly identify — included one of the most famous supermodels of our generation, an Oscar-winning actress, and an entirely different famous jewelry designer with whom I chatted about ketamine therapy. I realized that My Scent smelled flat-out expensive, which seems to be a selling point amongst perfume enthusiasts on social media. In fact, there\\'s a whole genre of #FragranceTok posts dedicated to perfumes that make you smell, well, rich.

One of the standouts: her gorgeous hair.Amika\\'s global artistic director Naeemah LaFond created the long, partially braided look. \"Quannah wanted her hair to be modern and true to her personal style as well as her culture, so her look features a sleek style with some intricate braiding,\" LaFond said in a statement. \"I chose a figure-eight braid because I knew it would make a statement, yet still allow the dress and the jewelry to be center stage.\"LaFond parted Chasinghorse\\'s hair slightly off-center and added a few drops of Amika Glass Action Universal Elixir. She then created the figure-eight braid on the side of Chasinghorse\\'s head and added a small cornrow beneath. After clipping in extensions for volume, LaFond sprayed the hair with Headstrong Intense Hold Hairspray, followed by The Shield Anti-Humidity Spray.

But while Cara Delevingne made her way to the Metropolitan Museum of Art wearing a satiny, red Dior Haute Couture suit, the talk, once she arrived, wasn\\'t so much about her ensemble as much as what was under it — which she made easy to see by fully removing her jacket to unveil gold-painted toplessness.Perhaps taking the \"gilded\" theme more literally than anyone else, Delevingne went full Goldfinger for the 2022 Met Gala, covering her skin from the neck down in metallic makeup. As she posed on the red carpet, the model and actor revealed that there was nothing but paint and pasties underneath her blazer. Okay, and some gold body jewelry too.Getty ImagesThe body makeup was nearly a perfect match for Delevingne\\'s golden shade of blonde. Hairstylist Mara Roszak styled her hair for the evening using Wella Professionals products to create a timeless, side-parted, smooth-waves look.\"First, we prepped the hair with Wella Professionals Color Fresh Mask in Golden Gloss to create the gorgeous golden tone that we were going for. I loved the warmth of the color and also how healthy it made the hair look,\" Roszak said in a statement. Then, on Delevingne\\'s wet hair, she applied EIMI Extra Volume Mousse Strong Hold Volumizing Mousse for soft hold and volume.

Gold and silver crystals surrounded Delevingne\\'s lash lines, curving out into wings that met the ends of her brows.Getty ImagesIt\\'s probably safe to assume that Delevingne\\'s wasn\\'t the most comfortable look of the night, but it\\'s easily one of the most memorable.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King\\'s Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNow watch TikTok star Emma Norton\\'s beauty routine:Follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter for daily beauty stories delivered right to your inbox.', \"As the Twitter joke goes, the Met Gala is the one night of the year where we all get to judge celebrities' looks while we lounge around in stained sweatpants.

Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers. It was shiny gold and covered in ruby and pearl-looking appliqués. She also sported a gold, armor-esque covering on her other pointer finger. The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore.

Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas gave her a neutral smokey eye with a hint of bright yellow on the inner crease and waterline that complemented the daring gown very well. As for her hair, hairstylist Jared Henderson (known as JStay Ready to many) slicked her dark hair into a high ponytail with a flipped end that we have a good feeling was fun to whip around.Getty ImagesTypically Doja Cat wears lengthy nails, but for this look, she kept them short. Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe. But this manicure is anything but simple, because this opulent jewelry is basically nail art.Her middle finger had the largest ring, which covered her entire finger and nail. The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one! What else can we pierce?Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"And then it literally never healed. The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me. I\\'m going to keep it forever.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookI Got a Tragus Piercing — Here\\'s What You Should Know Before Getting OneNow, see 100 years of piercings in less than three minutes:', 'To me, tragus piercings always stood for college rebellion. One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade.

Yep, it\\'s equally as disappointing when you find an eye-catching set of earrings only to find it\\'s made of materials that could irritate your skin.

All around me were people filling in or touching up their ink, but I continued onward past the buzzing needles — straight to the back, where the piercer works. After a tough year, I was ready for a bit of body modification to memorialize the challenges and symbolize the jump forward into 2022. What I didn\\'t realize, as I asked for a third lobe piercing to continue to build my stack of hoops, is that my bright idea was of a pace with a wide new piercing trend.More and more customers are asking for what Alaina Rothstein, cofounder of Los Angeles ear piercing service Leo West, refers to as a \"milestone piercing.\" Rothstein has seen mothers and daughters come in for birthday piercing; she knows of a woman who miscarried and got a stud to remind her of the loss. \"It\\'s a fun, really beautiful way to carry something special with you in happy times and in sad times,\" she says. \"And I think it\\'s like super cool that it\\'s translated [from the tattoo world] into the piercing world.\"Our piercers have seen birthdays, bachelorette parties, and groups of friends come in to celebrate together. But what trends are they trying, specifically? In other words, which parts of the ear are getting the most adoration through adornment right now?Meet the experts:Alaina Rothstein and Jill Katz, RN, cofounders of Los Angeles ear-piercing service Leo WestLisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a piercing studio with locations in New York, Texas, and California (among others)Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer at Live by the Sword Tattoo in Brooklyn, New YorkIn This Story:Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?How to Pick Your PiercerConstellation PiercingsStacked LobesVertical StacksForward HelixSnakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)ConchOuter Conch, a.k.a. SconchJump ahead, or read on for everything you need to know about the freshest ear-piercing trends, as well as the estimated length of time the healing process may take.Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?Milestones are one reason customers are flocking to their local licensed piercer, but another is a generalized sense of freedom and autonomy that\\'s arrived as a result of the pandemic. \"With remote work and workplace norms overall changing, more people are feeling free to experiment with bolder looks and express their personality,\" says Lisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a national piercing studio. That experimentation shows up both in the amount of piercings and in the piercings themselves, which are getting \"more creative,\" Bubbers says. (Plus, as Rothstein points out, \"one fun thing about mask-wearing is that your ears show.\")The last \"really important trend,\" as Leo West cofounder Jill Katz, RN describes it, is \"adorning what you got.\" There\\'s no normal, she says. A gorgeous earscape is all about working with your budget and your anatomy to create an embodiment of your style in tiny, beautiful silver, gold, or gem form.The result: forward helices, vertically stacked lobes, conches, sconches, snake bites, and plenty of other piercing types we never knew existed, spanning from the outer rims of the ear to the inner cartilage and back to the earlobe. Our trend-spotting piercers shared the adornments they\\'ve seen grow more popular over 2022, and what they envision for the years (and ears!) to come.How to Pick Your PiercerJust as with microblading, filler, or any other body modification, it\\'s important to find a professional piercer that you trust, with a style that appeals to you. This is an essential step, whether you’re a longtime body modification fan or it’s your first piercing ever.As Brooks notes, the benefit of following a piercer on social media is that you can seek them out and, as in one service she offers, put your ear(s) in her hands. During a \"curation\" appointment, the expert will look at your ear as a whole and help design multiple piercings to fit your style and your desires.At Leo West, that might look like getting multiple differentiated piercings on each ear. \"Symmetry is out,\" says Rothstein. As she points out, a specialist is extra helpful if you\\'re nervous about curating an asymmetrical look. \"It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t want ears that match, but it has to have a rhyme or reason to it,\" she says. \"I have two ears, and I like to say ‘one’s a little bit classy, one\\'s a little bit sassy.\\'\"Constellation PiercingsInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhile some of this year\\'s trends include holes in unexpected places, more of them involve third, fourth, or fifth additions to an already-pierced ear. At Leo West, the result is what they\\'ve named a \"constellation.\" A constellation consists of \"really small pieces, close together, closer than what your traditional spacing would be,\" explains Rothstein. The result is an \"intentionally random\" grouping of ear piercings that show off studs and gems.Stacked LobesInstagram user @leowestco\"People often come in [to the studio] and say \\'I’m not cool enough,\\'\" for a trendy piercing, recounts Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer in Brooklyn. If you\\'re intimidated by the thought of a conch piercing or even a constellation, Brooks thinks that an ear stack is an easier entry point. These piercings are less painful than their cartilage-filled brethren, and can make their way up the lobe either evenly spaced or placed close together.Vertical StacksInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"If I\\'m being honest, I love to put my hair behind my ear to show the little pops of pieces sitting right above your classic [piercing],\" laughs Rothstein. She\\'s referring to a vertical stack, which entails a piercing centered directly above your traditional first or second hole. It\\'s usually filled with a small stone or a small star, Rothstein\\'s favorite. This piercing does require a certain amount of space on the lobe, but if you have enough canvas to play with, it \"gives the ear a little extra uniqueness.\"Forward Helixcourtesy of StudsThe official name for that bouncy piece of cartilage where your ear meets your skull is the \"forward helix.\" According to Bubbers, customers are coming in requesting one or even multiple piercings on the forward helix. \"We do see new and different piercing trends emerge each year based on what’s trending in fashion, culture, and celebrity,\" she says. Celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Chantal Jeffries have helped popularize the new (and finicky — helix piercings can take up to nine months to heal) style.Snakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)In the realm of body piercing, the term \"snakebite\" typically refers to two piercings on either side of your lower lip, oftentimes barbells or studs.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen it comes to ears, however, it entails two holes placed close together, slightly separated from the rest of your ear piercings, giving the impression of that your piercer just might have used two fangs to get the job done. According to Bubbers, most customers opt for a snakebite in their “midi,\" the center point of the outer ear.ConchInstagram user @leowestcoWe\\'ve named conch piercings as of-trend for the past few years, but the cartilage piercing is still popular enough to remain on the list. It pierces through the inner-ear cartilage that makes up the back of the year. At Studs, Bubbers says customers are opting more and more for a snakebite on the conch for a doubly trendy effect.Outer Conch (Sometimes Known as a \"Sconch\")courtesy of Studs\"I hope you don\\'t use this name,\" laughs Brooks. She prefers the more medical-sounding \"outer conch,\" but the phrase \"sconch\" is catching on to describe a piercing placed at the lining ridge in the cavern space close to the center of the ear.\"It\\'s right in your eye-line when people look at you,\" she says, so it provides a way to show a bit of personality even when you\\'re on Zoom or wearing a mask. Because it\\'ll be eye-catching no matter what kind of earring(s) you have in, Brooks likes adorning an outer conch piercing with a piece of jewelry that makes a big statement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesMore on the world of piercings:How Tongue Piercings Work, From Pain Level and Placement to Aftercare and Healing TimeHow to Remove Every Type of Piercing at Home8 Types of Ear Piercings, ExplainedContraconch Ear Piercings Are Gaining Popularity for Its Unexpected PlacementIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?

That way, I have a scent memory anchored to that destination or time period for whenever I choose to relive it. My last international trip, to a prestigious wellness resort in Austria for some on-the-ground reporting, demanded a very specific choice: something compact enough to fit in my carry-on without getting tossed by TSA, calming enough to match the vibe of the Alpine oasis, and extra long-lasting so it would last through hikes, meals, and medical treatments without reapplication. Lastly, it would need to smell expensive, because my fellow wellness-seekers would expect as much — but we\\'ll get to that later.After much deliberation, I landed on a luxe new formula that had just hit my desk before my flight: the Jennifer Fisher My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil.My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil$65I was initially surprised that Jennifer Fisher, a jewelry designer beloved by her red carpet clientele and the master behind some of Jennifer Lopez\\'s favorite hoop earrings, had ventured into perfumery. That said, fragrance does feel like a sparkling accessory that amps up any outfit or beauty look, and Fisher wanted her new perfume oil to make a statement for the wearer. \"I want anyone wearing My Scent to feel confident and sexy,\" she tells Allure. “And to smell like a fresh baked cookie.\" Upon first wear, I didn\\'t flag baked goods as a top note, but I did instantly fall for the vanilla and coconut Fisher knew she wanted to include in the formula.\"The blend of vanilla and coconut brings back memories from my childhood growing up in Santa Barbara, California,\" she says. \"For years, I was combining different vanilla and coconut fragrances to try and create my own personal scent. Finding a scent that was a combination of surf wax from the beaches in my hometown, Montecito, and a fresh baked cookie is what I\\'ve always wanted.\"Australian sandalwood, pear, and Tonka bean flank the creamy hero notes, and it all comes together to smell equal parts sunny and cozy, like throwing on a cashmere sweater on a breezy summer night. Toting it around is just as effortless too: I carried the teeny-tiny rollerball in my airplane carry-on, my spa robe to and from massages and lunch, and even in my fanny pack while Nordic walking in the mountains.No, really, I took this tube everywhere with me.\\nTaylore Glynn\"I wanted to come out with something small, compact, and portable you could throw in your bag and take everywhere with you,\" says Fisher. \"A spray to me didn\\'t feel as transportable, but that doesn\\'t mean I am ruling it out for the next product. This oil was designed intentionally to be worn and carried on-the-go.\" In addition to being totable, the formula also fulfilled my need for something that would last through spa treatments and saunas.\"Coconut is a good oil carrier to round out scents,\" says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, noting that scent can last longer in oil form because it\\'s not watered down. \"Atomized scents usually contain alcohol to help spraying. Fragrance oil is the most concentrated form [you can find].\"The scent was so powerful that even my fellow resort guests noticed. In fact, I was flagged down multiple times in the dining room and in the halls to reveal what I was wearing because it smelled \"beautiful\" and \"divine.\" For important context, some of the resort guests on the premises at the time — who I can\\'t explicitly identify — included one of the most famous supermodels of our generation, an Oscar-winning actress, and an entirely different famous jewelry designer with whom I chatted about ketamine therapy. I realized that My Scent smelled flat-out expensive, which seems to be a selling point amongst perfume enthusiasts on social media. In fact, there\\'s a whole genre of #FragranceTok posts dedicated to perfumes that make you smell, well, rich. After studying these videos, there\\'s a handful of perfumes that seem to universally smell like wealth: Parfums de Marly Delina, Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Montale Paris Intense Cafe, and three different Maison Francis Kurkdjian perfumes.Courtesy of brandParfums de Marly Delina$335Courtesy of brandYves Saint Laurent Libre Eau de Parfum Spray$140 $112 at NordstromIntense Cafe Eau de Parfum$170Courtesy of brandMaison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540$325They all also happen to share one intoxicating note: vanilla, which lies at the heart of My Scent.

As she posed on the red carpet, the model and actor revealed that there was nothing but paint and pasties underneath her blazer.

The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one!

The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me. I\\'m going to keep it forever.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookI Got a Tragus Piercing — Here\\'s What You Should Know Before Getting OneNow, see 100 years of piercings in less than three minutes:', 'To me, tragus piercings always stood for college rebellion. One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade.

Yep, it\\'s equally as disappointing when you find an eye-catching set of earrings only to find it\\'s made of materials that could irritate your skin.

All around me were people filling in or touching up their ink, but I continued onward past the buzzing needles — straight to the back, where the piercer works. After a tough year, I was ready for a bit of body modification to memorialize the challenges and symbolize the jump forward into 2022. What I didn\\'t realize, as I asked for a third lobe piercing to continue to build my stack of hoops, is that my bright idea was of a pace with a wide new piercing trend.More and more customers are asking for what Alaina Rothstein, cofounder of Los Angeles ear piercing service Leo West, refers to as a \"milestone piercing.\" Rothstein has seen mothers and daughters come in for birthday piercing; she knows of a woman who miscarried and got a stud to remind her of the loss. \"It\\'s a fun, really beautiful way to carry something special with you in happy times and in sad times,\" she says. \"And I think it\\'s like super cool that it\\'s translated [from the tattoo world] into the piercing world.\"Our piercers have seen birthdays, bachelorette parties, and groups of friends come in to celebrate together. But what trends are they trying, specifically? In other words, which parts of the ear are getting the most adoration through adornment right now?Meet the experts:Alaina Rothstein and Jill Katz, RN, cofounders of Los Angeles ear-piercing service Leo WestLisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a piercing studio with locations in New York, Texas, and California (among others)Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer at Live by the Sword Tattoo in Brooklyn, New YorkIn This Story:Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?How to Pick Your PiercerConstellation PiercingsStacked LobesVertical StacksForward HelixSnakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)ConchOuter Conch, a.k.a.

That experimentation shows up both in the amount of piercings and in the piercings themselves, which are getting \"more creative,\" Bubbers says. (Plus, as Rothstein points out, \"one fun thing about mask-wearing is that your ears show.\")The last \"really important trend,\" as Leo West cofounder Jill Katz, RN describes it, is \"adorning what you got.\" There\\'s no normal, she says. A gorgeous earscape is all about working with your budget and your anatomy to create an embodiment of your style in tiny, beautiful silver, gold, or gem form.The result: forward helices, vertically stacked lobes, conches, sconches, snake bites, and plenty of other piercing types we never knew existed, spanning from the outer rims of the ear to the inner cartilage and back to the earlobe. Our trend-spotting piercers shared the adornments they\\'ve seen grow more popular over 2022, and what they envision for the years (and ears!) to come.How to Pick Your PiercerJust as with microblading, filler, or any other body modification, it\\'s important to find a professional piercer that you trust, with a style that appeals to you. This is an essential step, whether you’re a longtime body modification fan or it’s your first piercing ever.As Brooks notes, the benefit of following a piercer on social media is that you can seek them out and, as in one service she offers, put your ear(s) in her hands. During a \"curation\" appointment, the expert will look at your ear as a whole and help design multiple piercings to fit your style and your desires.At Leo West, that might look like getting multiple differentiated piercings on each ear. \"Symmetry is out,\" says Rothstein. As she points out, a specialist is extra helpful if you\\'re nervous about curating an asymmetrical look. \"It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t want ears that match, but it has to have a rhyme or reason to it,\" she says. \"I have two ears, and I like to say ‘one’s a little bit classy, one\\'s a little bit sassy.\\'\"Constellation PiercingsInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhile some of this year\\'s trends include holes in unexpected places, more of them involve third, fourth, or fifth additions to an already-pierced ear. At Leo West, the result is what they\\'ve named a \"constellation.\" A constellation consists of \"really small pieces, close together, closer than what your traditional spacing would be,\" explains Rothstein. The result is an \"intentionally random\" grouping of ear piercings that show off studs and gems.Stacked LobesInstagram user @leowestco\"People often come in [to the studio] and say \\'I’m not cool enough,\\'\" for a trendy piercing, recounts Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer in Brooklyn. If you\\'re intimidated by the thought of a conch piercing or even a constellation, Brooks thinks that an ear stack is an easier entry point. These piercings are less painful than their cartilage-filled brethren, and can make their way up the lobe either evenly spaced or placed close together.Vertical StacksInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"If I\\'m being honest, I love to put my hair behind my ear to show the little pops of pieces sitting right above your classic [piercing],\" laughs Rothstein. She\\'s referring to a vertical stack, which entails a piercing centered directly above your traditional first or second hole. It\\'s usually filled with a small stone or a small star, Rothstein\\'s favorite. This piercing does require a certain amount of space on the lobe, but if you have enough canvas to play with, it \"gives the ear a little extra uniqueness.\"Forward Helixcourtesy of StudsThe official name for that bouncy piece of cartilage where your ear meets your skull is the \"forward helix.\" According to Bubbers, customers are coming in requesting one or even multiple piercings on the forward helix. \"We do see new and different piercing trends emerge each year based on what’s trending in fashion, culture, and celebrity,\" she says. Celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Chantal Jeffries have helped popularize the new (and finicky — helix piercings can take up to nine months to heal) style.Snakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)In the realm of body piercing, the term \"snakebite\" typically refers to two piercings on either side of your lower lip, oftentimes barbells or studs.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen it comes to ears, however, it entails two holes placed close together, slightly separated from the rest of your ear piercings, giving the impression of that your piercer just might have used two fangs to get the job done. According to Bubbers, most customers opt for a snakebite in their “midi,\" the center point of the outer ear.ConchInstagram user @leowestcoWe\\'ve named conch piercings as of-trend for the past few years, but the cartilage piercing is still popular enough to remain on the list. It pierces through the inner-ear cartilage that makes up the back of the year.

That way, I have a scent memory anchored to that destination or time period for whenever I choose to relive it. My last international trip, to a prestigious wellness resort in Austria for some on-the-ground reporting, demanded a very specific choice: something compact enough to fit in my carry-on without getting tossed by TSA, calming enough to match the vibe of the Alpine oasis, and extra long-lasting so it would last through hikes, meals, and medical treatments without reapplication. Lastly, it would need to smell expensive, because my fellow wellness-seekers would expect as much — but we\\'ll get to that later.After much deliberation, I landed on a luxe new formula that had just hit my desk before my flight: the Jennifer Fisher My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil.My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil$65I was initially surprised that Jennifer Fisher, a jewelry designer beloved by her red carpet clientele and the master behind some of Jennifer Lopez\\'s favorite hoop earrings, had ventured into perfumery. That said, fragrance does feel like a sparkling accessory that amps up any outfit or beauty look, and Fisher wanted her new perfume oil to make a statement for the wearer. \"I want anyone wearing My Scent to feel confident and sexy,\" she tells Allure. “And to smell like a fresh baked cookie.\" Upon first wear, I didn\\'t flag baked goods as a top note, but I did instantly fall for the vanilla and coconut Fisher knew she wanted to include in the formula.\"The blend of vanilla and coconut brings back memories from my childhood growing up in Santa Barbara, California,\" she says. \"For years, I was combining different vanilla and coconut fragrances to try and create my own personal scent. Finding a scent that was a combination of surf wax from the beaches in my hometown, Montecito, and a fresh baked cookie is what I\\'ve always wanted.\"Australian sandalwood, pear, and Tonka bean flank the creamy hero notes, and it all comes together to smell equal parts sunny and cozy, like throwing on a cashmere sweater on a breezy summer night. Toting it around is just as effortless too: I carried the teeny-tiny rollerball in my airplane carry-on, my spa robe to and from massages and lunch, and even in my fanny pack while Nordic walking in the mountains.No, really, I took this tube everywhere with me.\\nTaylore Glynn\"I wanted to come out with something small, compact, and portable you could throw in your bag and take everywhere with you,\" says Fisher. \"A spray to me didn\\'t feel as transportable, but that doesn\\'t mean I am ruling it out for the next product. This oil was designed intentionally to be worn and carried on-the-go.\" In addition to being totable, the formula also fulfilled my need for something that would last through spa treatments and saunas.\"Coconut is a good oil carrier to round out scents,\" says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, noting that scent can last longer in oil form because it\\'s not watered down. \"Atomized scents usually contain alcohol to help spraying. Fragrance oil is the most concentrated form [you can find].\"The scent was so powerful that even my fellow resort guests noticed. In fact, I was flagged down multiple times in the dining room and in the halls to reveal what I was wearing because it smelled \"beautiful\" and \"divine.\" For important context, some of the resort guests on the premises at the time — who I can\\'t explicitly identify — included one of the most famous supermodels of our generation, an Oscar-winning actress, and an entirely different famous jewelry designer with whom I chatted about ketamine therapy. I realized that My Scent smelled flat-out expensive, which seems to be a selling point amongst perfume enthusiasts on social media. In fact, there\\'s a whole genre of #FragranceTok posts dedicated to perfumes that make you smell, well, rich.

And we certainly can't leave out the Hadid sisters' bleached brows for their own prance down the very same runways. It's not much of a shocker, then, that Gigi Hadid went for something a bit odd and definitely bold for a recent red-carpet beauty moment. For the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards on November 7, Hadid graced the carpet with an unconventional cool gray lipstick.I'll be the first to admit that I did a double-take at first glimpse. No, it's not your typical choice where a lipstick shade is concerned, but makeup artists Patrick Ta and Akina Shimizu were able to pull off this muted-yet-fresh-faced makeup look on Hadid. Catch me zooming in on those lips that are seemingly matte and glossy at the same time. We're definitely not the only ones hoping the details will soon be dropped on what particular beauty brand this lipstick is made by. Nonetheless, this all-American color pallet is insanely cohesive.Let's also not forget the striking blonde hair color and the sleek, slicked-back bun hair stylist Laura Polko put together to bring out the jewelry on Hadid's ears and nose.

In her carousel of pics, Bieber wears a top and miniskirt made of huge pink roses, enhanced by a matching pink organza ruffled train at her hips. Roses also pop up on one ankle and serve as a flower crown atop her head. The look is very The Birth of Venus but make it fashion —and floral.Bieber let the roses be the centerpiece of her costume and kept her hair and makeup subtle and natural with radiant \"glazed\" skin, deep rose lips, and a hint of shimmery pink eye shadow, then finished off the costume with a pale pink and white manicure. She wore no jewelry or accessories other than her engagement diamond and a pair of pale pink ankle-strap sandals. While Casta wore the rose look with Raphaelite ringlet curls, Bieber decided on loose brunette waves for a more modern approach. I just have one question, Hailey: Are those real roses? Hopefully, you de-thorned them if so!Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Later on during Halloweekend, Bieber ditched the angelic florals of her first costume in favor of something darker: a \"Versace Vampire.\" The model donned a strappy black bustier top and high-waisted black skirt with a black and gold Versace logo belt, opera-length shiny black latex gloves, and a pair of vampire fangs for the Goth-inspired vampire moment.

You can find plenty of examples across social media. Just look to hashtags #tonguepiercing and #tonguepiercings on TikTok and Instagram, which have over 790 million views and 520,000 posts, respectively.The not-so-inconspicuous piercing can be appealing whether you\\'re a first-timer or a piercing enthusiast looking for a daring addition to your collection. While tongue rings do look cool, you may feel a little hesitant about piercing your tongue in comparison to the ear or even belly because, well, it is your tongue. The stakes seem higher and more dangerous should an infection occur.But despite the location, the aftercare for tongue piercings is actually a lot easier (and a lot less painful) than some would expect. Here\\'s everything you need to know before scheduling your piercing appointment, whether you\\'re undecided about taking the plunge or ready to get your tongue pierced tomorrow.Meet the experts:Jenna Myers, a piercer at Live By the Sword Tattoo in New York CityErich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone HealthLynn Loheide, a body piercer based in Nashville, TennesseeAre tongue piercings dangerous?Before you even think about setting up your appointment, it\\'s important to understand the risks associated with tongue piercings. Like any piercing, there\\'s always a possibility of infection or rejection.Sometimes the signs of infection can be easy to confuse with irritation in piercings, especially if you\\'re extra paranoid. But New York City-based piercer Jenna Myers says that there tends to be a pretty big distinction between the two.\"[With an] infection, your tongue is going to look absolutely wild,\" Myers shares. \"It\\'ll be two to three times the size, turning almost green or white, [with puss].\" When that happens, she always advises going to the ER for professional help. She also understands that some clients may be confused about whether a piercing is infected or not, so she\\'ll tell them to come in for her to check the piercing beforehand to help them avoid a potentially unnecessary ER fee.Erich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone Health, notes that pus, severe tongue swelling, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and difficult breathing indicate that it\\'s time to seek out a medical professional. Typically, infected piercings are usually treated with antibiotics and the removal of jewelry, he explains.But there are some rare cases where surgery might be needed to drain an abscess or deal with any other complications, according to Dr. Voigt. For example, he once had to perform an emergency surgery on a patient because their tongue started to fill with blood and swell, leading them to choke. \"Fortunately, I was able to take the person to the operating room, remove the piercing (which was difficult because half of it became incorporated into the swollen tongue), incise the tongue, tie off a bleeding artery and well as cauterize the muscles, and then suture the tongue back together,\" Dr. Voigt shares.Luckily, not every tongue piercing will become infected. Still, it\\'s important to note that regardless of placement, the piercing can cause damage to the teeth and gums, according to piercer Lynn Loheide and Dr. Voigt. \"You need to understand that going into it, be okay with that risk, and also know what you have to do to minimize that risk,\" Loheide shares.Are horizontal \"snake eyes\" tongue piercings safe?Speaking of placement, there are restrictions as to where the tongue piercing can go. You might have heard of snake eyes before. For those who are unfamiliar, this style typically refers to a horizontal tongue piercing at the tip of the tongue. And if you had hopes of getting that piercing, keep dreaming. Unfortunately, experts say that tongue piercings should only go vertically through the tongue because horizontal placement comes with a big risk of damage to the teeth and gum recession.\"When we\\'re piercing vertically, especially in the center, we\\'re piercing through a connective tissue between those muscles,\" Loheide explains. \"But when you\\'re piercing horizontally, you\\'re actually pinning those muscles together, and that can cause a lot of damage.\" They also note that in the state of Oregon, horizontal tongue piercings are banned for this reason.Can anyone get a tongue piercing?Though everyone\\'s tongue is different, Loheide says if your tongue is too short or you have a tongue-tie — which is basically when the webbing underneath your tongue comes almost or all the way to the tip — a tongue piercing is probably not the best option for you.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen you arrive at your appointment, don\\'t be surprised if the piercer starts analyzing your mouth. In fact, that\\'s a good sign because your unique anatomy will dictate where you can and can\\'t get pierced, and any reputable piercer will ensure to take that into account, Loheide shares.\"We want to see where the blood flow is along the underside of the tongue and make sure that we\\'re not too close to it,\" they explain. \"But we also want to look at the shape of someone\\'s teeth and someone\\'s mouth when we\\'re deciding placement.\" That way, a piercer can ensure that they aren\\'t causing unnecessary damage and that the jewelry won\\'t rub up uncomfortably against your teeth.What can I expect during a tongue piercing appointment?Before your appointment, it\\'s imperative that you brush your teeth and tongue before arriving. Myers shares that typically her clients are given mouthwash right before to help clean their mouths out.As mentioned above, most of your appointment will be spent on prepping and checking your tongue before the needle is inserted. The actual piercing part of the session is short, just like most other piercings — a hollow needle is pushed through the tongue, and then the piercer adds the jewelry, which is a barbell shape.For standard tongue piercings, the ring is usually in the center of the tongue. Though horizontal piercings are a big no-no, you can still get two vertical tongue piercings. Some may call them venom piercings, but Loheide prefers to just refer to them as paired tongue piercings because for some people venom refers to two horizontal piercings, and the slang terms used change over time.\"Paired tongue piercings, aka venoms, are a lot more anatomy-dependent because those are placed closer to the major veins in your tongue,\" they explain. \"So we have to make sure that there\\'s space around that blood flow for them to be placed safely.\"Like any piercing, you should expect pain, and though it\\'s subjective, Loheide and Myers both swear that a tongue piercing is not as bad as you might think. \"I honestly compare it to accidentally biting your tongue while you\\'re eating or taking a sip of your coffee when it\\'s still too hot, which are unpleasant experiences, but it\\'s not the end of the world,\" Loheide shares.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn fact, they say that the most uncomfortable part is having the piercer\\'s hands in your mouth for an extended amount of time. Myers notes that on a scale of one to 10, most of her clients rate standard tongue piercings between a one to three, and paired tongue piercings a three to five.What does aftercare for a tongue piercing look like?There are a few things to expect immediately after your piercing. If you\\'ve been pierced before, some of these won\\'t be too shocking, but there are certain effects that are specific to tongue piercings.Right after your appointment, expect your tongue to be a bit swollen and painful for about one to two weeks, according to Loheide. That\\'s naturally going to happen because the piercing is a fresh wound. In addition to the pain and swelling, you\\'ll also deal with a slight lisp or change in how you speak. \"After about a week, the swelling will go down, and then the rest of the healing process is pretty easy,\" they share.Myers estimates that for a single tongue piercing, it will take about one to three months and three to five for paired piercings. \"Because the tongue is so vascular, it has a lot of blood flow to it, so it heals really quickly,\" she says. On the other hand, Loheide says to expect it to take about three to five months to be fully healed.Thankfully, the aftercare for tongue piercings isn\\'t too complicated. In general, maintaining good oral hygiene — brushing your teeth regularly and flossing — is important. Once you get home, Loheide recommends immediately changing out your toothbrush for a new one and using milder oral hygiene products. They advise avoiding toothpaste with whitening ingredients.Both piercers strongly suggest using an alcohol-free mouthwash that won\\'t burn your mouth. Loheide likes Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse because it doesn\\'t taste as badly as some alcohol-free mouthwashes do, it\\'s affordable, and can be found in most drug stores. Myers also recommends sterile saline solution, which tends to be recommended for most piercings.Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse$10Apart from switching up your oral products, you may have to change what you eat, but only for a short while. Myers suggests avoiding spicy, crunchy, and acidic foods in the first few weeks to avoid irritation. \"Things that you wouldn\\'t [want on] a paper cut, basically, you don\\'t want to eat the first few weeks of a tongue piercing, because it will cause serious discomfort,\" she says.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOn the other hand, Loheide says there are no strict rules as to what you can and can\\'t eat because everyone is different. But you still have to be mindful of how your mouth and tongue feel when you do eat or drink certain things. \"If you go to eat something and you\\'re like, \\'Wow, this feels terrible to eat,\\' don\\'t keep eating it,\" they share.Ultimately, try to not go overboard with your piercing aftercare, because that could potentially case more irritation. \"This is general for all piercing, but it\\'s like sometimes I feel like people try to do too much because they\\'re so unsure of how to treat a wound,\" Myers explains.\" Being as simple as possible with your aftercare is really best. Your body is really good at healing itself.\"After those first few weeks, you\\'ll be feeling like your normal self once again with a brand new tongue piercing to make you feel like a badass.Read more stories about piercings:7 Piercing Trends That Will Be Everywhere in 2022How to Remove Every Kind of Piercing Jewelry at HomeIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?Now enjoy the unboxing of the April 2022 Allure Beauty Box:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'Doja Cat is ready to travel to a galaxy far, far away.

I cannot tell you one time, since the beginning of my life, that I\\'ve ever been like, \\'This is cool. I just do not like to have hair,\\'\" she said in the Live.

Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers.

The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples.

I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one! What else can we pierce?Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"And then it literally never healed. The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me. I\\'m going to keep it forever.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookI Got a Tragus Piercing — Here\\'s What You Should Know Before Getting OneNow, see 100 years of piercings in less than three minutes:', 'To me, tragus piercings always stood for college rebellion. One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade.

Yep, it\\'s equally as disappointing when you find an eye-catching set of earrings only to find it\\'s made of materials that could irritate your skin. Sure, they say pain is beauty, but when that pain involves itchiness, redness, and uncomfortable rashes (on an already-thin and sensitive part of your skin, no less), it begs the question: \"were these hoops really worth it?\" The short answer is, well, no.And remember: you\\'ll know if your piercing is infected if it\\'s red, inflamed, sore, hot to touch, or if it\\'s releasing puss. You should consult with your physician if you suspect you have an infection.The truth is, if you\\'re someone who struggles with finding earrings that won\\'t cause discomfort, you may have to work a little harder to find your match. \"Unfortunately, sterling silver jewelry is made with a mix of metals, often nickel, which is the most significant irritant to sensitive ears,\" explains Ottawa-based medical director of Concept Medical Samuel Hetz, MD. \"Those with sensitive ears want to find hypoallergenic rhodium-plated jewelry with low to no nickel content.\" He recommends looking for the standard benchmarks of 14k gold or above as well as sterling silver 925 grade to reduce the chances of nickel content.Because we don\\'t believe those with sensitive skin should be left out of the party, we rounded up nine of the best earrings for sensitive ears that are always stylish, and never irritating.BaubleBar Sutara 18K Gold Earrings$48 at BaubleBar$42 at NordstromFor sensitive-skinned folks, Baublebar\\'s Sutara Earrings will make you thank your lucky stars they\\'re made out of 18k gold.

All around me were people filling in or touching up their ink, but I continued onward past the buzzing needles — straight to the back, where the piercer works. After a tough year, I was ready for a bit of body modification to memorialize the challenges and symbolize the jump forward into 2022. What I didn\\'t realize, as I asked for a third lobe piercing to continue to build my stack of hoops, is that my bright idea was of a pace with a wide new piercing trend.More and more customers are asking for what Alaina Rothstein, cofounder of Los Angeles ear piercing service Leo West, refers to as a \"milestone piercing.\" Rothstein has seen mothers and daughters come in for birthday piercing; she knows of a woman who miscarried and got a stud to remind her of the loss. \"It\\'s a fun, really beautiful way to carry something special with you in happy times and in sad times,\" she says. \"And I think it\\'s like super cool that it\\'s translated [from the tattoo world] into the piercing world.\"Our piercers have seen birthdays, bachelorette parties, and groups of friends come in to celebrate together. But what trends are they trying, specifically? In other words, which parts of the ear are getting the most adoration through adornment right now?Meet the experts:Alaina Rothstein and Jill Katz, RN, cofounders of Los Angeles ear-piercing service Leo WestLisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a piercing studio with locations in New York, Texas, and California (among others)Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer at Live by the Sword Tattoo in Brooklyn, New YorkIn This Story:Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?How to Pick Your PiercerConstellation PiercingsStacked LobesVertical StacksForward HelixSnakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)ConchOuter Conch, a.k.a. SconchJump ahead, or read on for everything you need to know about the freshest ear-piercing trends, as well as the estimated length of time the healing process may take.Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?Milestones are one reason customers are flocking to their local licensed piercer, but another is a generalized sense of freedom and autonomy that\\'s arrived as a result of the pandemic. \"With remote work and workplace norms overall changing, more people are feeling free to experiment with bolder looks and express their personality,\" says Lisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a national piercing studio. That experimentation shows up both in the amount of piercings and in the piercings themselves, which are getting \"more creative,\" Bubbers says. (Plus, as Rothstein points out, \"one fun thing about mask-wearing is that your ears show.\")The last \"really important trend,\" as Leo West cofounder Jill Katz, RN describes it, is \"adorning what you got.\" There\\'s no normal, she says. A gorgeous earscape is all about working with your budget and your anatomy to create an embodiment of your style in tiny, beautiful silver, gold, or gem form.The result: forward helices, vertically stacked lobes, conches, sconches, snake bites, and plenty of other piercing types we never knew existed, spanning from the outer rims of the ear to the inner cartilage and back to the earlobe. Our trend-spotting piercers shared the adornments they\\'ve seen grow more popular over 2022, and what they envision for the years (and ears!) to come.How to Pick Your PiercerJust as with microblading, filler, or any other body modification, it\\'s important to find a professional piercer that you trust, with a style that appeals to you. This is an essential step, whether you’re a longtime body modification fan or it’s your first piercing ever.As Brooks notes, the benefit of following a piercer on social media is that you can seek them out and, as in one service she offers, put your ear(s) in her hands. During a \"curation\" appointment, the expert will look at your ear as a whole and help design multiple piercings to fit your style and your desires.At Leo West, that might look like getting multiple differentiated piercings on each ear. \"Symmetry is out,\" says Rothstein. As she points out, a specialist is extra helpful if you\\'re nervous about curating an asymmetrical look. \"It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t want ears that match, but it has to have a rhyme or reason to it,\" she says. \"I have two ears, and I like to say ‘one’s a little bit classy, one\\'s a little bit sassy.\\'\"Constellation PiercingsInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhile some of this year\\'s trends include holes in unexpected places, more of them involve third, fourth, or fifth additions to an already-pierced ear. At Leo West, the result is what they\\'ve named a \"constellation.\" A constellation consists of \"really small pieces, close together, closer than what your traditional spacing would be,\" explains Rothstein. The result is an \"intentionally random\" grouping of ear piercings that show off studs and gems.Stacked LobesInstagram user @leowestco\"People often come in [to the studio] and say \\'I’m not cool enough,\\'\" for a trendy piercing, recounts Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer in Brooklyn. If you\\'re intimidated by the thought of a conch piercing or even a constellation, Brooks thinks that an ear stack is an easier entry point. These piercings are less painful than their cartilage-filled brethren, and can make their way up the lobe either evenly spaced or placed close together.Vertical StacksInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"If I\\'m being honest, I love to put my hair behind my ear to show the little pops of pieces sitting right above your classic [piercing],\" laughs Rothstein. She\\'s referring to a vertical stack, which entails a piercing centered directly above your traditional first or second hole. It\\'s usually filled with a small stone or a small star, Rothstein\\'s favorite. This piercing does require a certain amount of space on the lobe, but if you have enough canvas to play with, it \"gives the ear a little extra uniqueness.\"Forward Helixcourtesy of StudsThe official name for that bouncy piece of cartilage where your ear meets your skull is the \"forward helix.\" According to Bubbers, customers are coming in requesting one or even multiple piercings on the forward helix. \"We do see new and different piercing trends emerge each year based on what’s trending in fashion, culture, and celebrity,\" she says. Celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Chantal Jeffries have helped popularize the new (and finicky — helix piercings can take up to nine months to heal) style.Snakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)In the realm of body piercing, the term \"snakebite\" typically refers to two piercings on either side of your lower lip, oftentimes barbells or studs.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen it comes to ears, however, it entails two holes placed close together, slightly separated from the rest of your ear piercings, giving the impression of that your piercer just might have used two fangs to get the job done. According to Bubbers, most customers opt for a snakebite in their “midi,\" the center point of the outer ear.ConchInstagram user @leowestcoWe\\'ve named conch piercings as of-trend for the past few years, but the cartilage piercing is still popular enough to remain on the list. It pierces through the inner-ear cartilage that makes up the back of the year. At Studs, Bubbers says customers are opting more and more for a snakebite on the conch for a doubly trendy effect.Outer Conch (Sometimes Known as a \"Sconch\")courtesy of Studs\"I hope you don\\'t use this name,\" laughs Brooks. She prefers the more medical-sounding \"outer conch,\" but the phrase \"sconch\" is catching on to describe a piercing placed at the lining ridge in the cavern space close to the center of the ear.\"It\\'s right in your eye-line when people look at you,\" she says, so it provides a way to show a bit of personality even when you\\'re on Zoom or wearing a mask. Because it\\'ll be eye-catching no matter what kind of earring(s) you have in, Brooks likes adorning an outer conch piercing with a piece of jewelry that makes a big statement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesMore on the world of piercings:How Tongue Piercings Work, From Pain Level and Placement to Aftercare and Healing TimeHow to Remove Every Type of Piercing at Home8 Types of Ear Piercings, ExplainedContraconch Ear Piercings Are Gaining Popularity for Its Unexpected PlacementIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?

That prop might come in the form of lengthy tresses such as the hair extensions Hadid debuted on social media in October or the Swarovski crystals that cover every inch of her body and hair in the behind-the-scenes photos she shared on Instagram November 27. The model was appointed as Swarovski's holiday muse in its most recent campaign and if you take a look at the jewelry brand's official Instagram page, you'll see photos of Hadid's neck and wrists adorned in a silhouette of gleaming jewels.

That way, I have a scent memory anchored to that destination or time period for whenever I choose to relive it. My last international trip, to a prestigious wellness resort in Austria for some on-the-ground reporting, demanded a very specific choice: something compact enough to fit in my carry-on without getting tossed by TSA, calming enough to match the vibe of the Alpine oasis, and extra long-lasting so it would last through hikes, meals, and medical treatments without reapplication. Lastly, it would need to smell expensive, because my fellow wellness-seekers would expect as much — but we\\'ll get to that later.After much deliberation, I landed on a luxe new formula that had just hit my desk before my flight: the Jennifer Fisher My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil.My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil$65I was initially surprised that Jennifer Fisher, a jewelry designer beloved by her red carpet clientele and the master behind some of Jennifer Lopez\\'s favorite hoop earrings, had ventured into perfumery. That said, fragrance does feel like a sparkling accessory that amps up any outfit or beauty look, and Fisher wanted her new perfume oil to make a statement for the wearer. \"I want anyone wearing My Scent to feel confident and sexy,\" she tells Allure. “And to smell like a fresh baked cookie.\" Upon first wear, I didn\\'t flag baked goods as a top note, but I did instantly fall for the vanilla and coconut Fisher knew she wanted to include in the formula.\"The blend of vanilla and coconut brings back memories from my childhood growing up in Santa Barbara, California,\" she says. \"For years, I was combining different vanilla and coconut fragrances to try and create my own personal scent. Finding a scent that was a combination of surf wax from the beaches in my hometown, Montecito, and a fresh baked cookie is what I\\'ve always wanted.\"Australian sandalwood, pear, and Tonka bean flank the creamy hero notes, and it all comes together to smell equal parts sunny and cozy, like throwing on a cashmere sweater on a breezy summer night. Toting it around is just as effortless too: I carried the teeny-tiny rollerball in my airplane carry-on, my spa robe to and from massages and lunch, and even in my fanny pack while Nordic walking in the mountains.No, really, I took this tube everywhere with me.\\nTaylore Glynn\"I wanted to come out with something small, compact, and portable you could throw in your bag and take everywhere with you,\" says Fisher. \"A spray to me didn\\'t feel as transportable, but that doesn\\'t mean I am ruling it out for the next product. This oil was designed intentionally to be worn and carried on-the-go.\" In addition to being totable, the formula also fulfilled my need for something that would last through spa treatments and saunas.\"Coconut is a good oil carrier to round out scents,\" says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, noting that scent can last longer in oil form because it\\'s not watered down. \"Atomized scents usually contain alcohol to help spraying. Fragrance oil is the most concentrated form [you can find].\"The scent was so powerful that even my fellow resort guests noticed. In fact, I was flagged down multiple times in the dining room and in the halls to reveal what I was wearing because it smelled \"beautiful\" and \"divine.\" For important context, some of the resort guests on the premises at the time — who I can\\'t explicitly identify — included one of the most famous supermodels of our generation, an Oscar-winning actress, and an entirely different famous jewelry designer with whom I chatted about ketamine therapy. I realized that My Scent smelled flat-out expensive, which seems to be a selling point amongst perfume enthusiasts on social media. In fact, there\\'s a whole genre of #FragranceTok posts dedicated to perfumes that make you smell, well, rich. After studying these videos, there\\'s a handful of perfumes that seem to universally smell like wealth: Parfums de Marly Delina, Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Montale Paris Intense Cafe, and three different Maison Francis Kurkdjian perfumes.Courtesy of brandParfums de Marly Delina$335Courtesy of brandYves Saint Laurent Libre Eau de Parfum Spray$140 $112 at NordstromIntense Cafe Eau de Parfum$170Courtesy of brandMaison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540$325They all also happen to share one intoxicating note: vanilla, which lies at the heart of My Scent.

As she posed on the red carpet, the model and actor revealed that there was nothing but paint and pasties underneath her blazer. Okay, and some gold body jewelry too.Getty ImagesThe body makeup was nearly a perfect match for Delevingne\\'s golden shade of blonde.

And we certainly can't leave out the Hadid sisters' bleached brows for their own prance down the very same runways. It's not much of a shocker, then, that Gigi Hadid went for something a bit odd and definitely bold for a recent red-carpet beauty moment. For the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards on November 7, Hadid graced the carpet with an unconventional cool gray lipstick.I'll be the first to admit that I did a double-take at first glimpse. No, it's not your typical choice where a lipstick shade is concerned, but makeup artists Patrick Ta and Akina Shimizu were able to pull off this muted-yet-fresh-faced makeup look on Hadid. Catch me zooming in on those lips that are seemingly matte and glossy at the same time. We're definitely not the only ones hoping the details will soon be dropped on what particular beauty brand this lipstick is made by. Nonetheless, this all-American color pallet is insanely cohesive.Let's also not forget the striking blonde hair color and the sleek, slicked-back bun hair stylist Laura Polko put together to bring out the jewelry on Hadid's ears and nose. My favorite part is the septum ring paired with the tartan-patterned Thom Browne attire styled by Mimi Cuttrell — it's full-on grunge. I'm honestly tempted to break out my alternative pop-rock playlist, like, now.

The supermodel went for a runway-ready vibe for both of her costumes this year, though they were extremely different in tone.For her first look, Bieber covered herself in roses to pay homage to an Yves Saint Laurent haute couture runway look from 1999, originally worn by model Laetitia Casta. In her carousel of pics, Bieber wears a top and miniskirt made of huge pink roses, enhanced by a matching pink organza ruffled train at her hips. Roses also pop up on one ankle and serve as a flower crown atop her head. The look is very The Birth of Venus but make it fashion —and floral.Bieber let the roses be the centerpiece of her costume and kept her hair and makeup subtle and natural with radiant \"glazed\" skin, deep rose lips, and a hint of shimmery pink eye shadow, then finished off the costume with a pale pink and white manicure. She wore no jewelry or accessories other than her engagement diamond and a pair of pale pink ankle-strap sandals. While Casta wore the rose look with Raphaelite ringlet curls, Bieber decided on loose brunette waves for a more modern approach. I just have one question, Hailey: Are those real roses? Hopefully, you de-thorned them if so!Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Later on during Halloweekend, Bieber ditched the angelic florals of her first costume in favor of something darker: a \"Versace Vampire.\" The model donned a strappy black bustier top and high-waisted black skirt with a black and gold Versace logo belt, opera-length shiny black latex gloves, and a pair of vampire fangs for the Goth-inspired vampire moment. A black wig, bright purple eyeshadow, flushed cheeks, and blood-red lips (obviously), plus chunky gold necklaces and huge gold and pearl earrings added to the glamourous \\'90s Versace vibe; she could have walked right off a Gianni Versace runway, minus the fangs.Instagram/Hailey BieberThe two looks may have been complete opposites, but they paid homage to Bieber\\'s fashion roots in the most gorgeously spooky and stunning way.More celeb Halloween looks you may have missed:The Kardashian\\'s Halloween Costumes Included Mystique, Bride of Frankenstein and Jessie from Toy StoryYou Have to See Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly as Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee for HalloweenMegan Thee Stallion Has Outdone Herself in the Halloween Nail Art DepartmentMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNow, learn Hailey\\'s 10 biggest beauty tips:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'TikTok-turned-reality star Dixie D\\'Amelio finally committed to the hairstyle she\\'s been longing for since sixth grade.

You can find plenty of examples across social media. Just look to hashtags #tonguepiercing and #tonguepiercings on TikTok and Instagram, which have over 790 million views and 520,000 posts, respectively.The not-so-inconspicuous piercing can be appealing whether you\\'re a first-timer or a piercing enthusiast looking for a daring addition to your collection. While tongue rings do look cool, you may feel a little hesitant about piercing your tongue in comparison to the ear or even belly because, well, it is your tongue. The stakes seem higher and more dangerous should an infection occur.But despite the location, the aftercare for tongue piercings is actually a lot easier (and a lot less painful) than some would expect. Here\\'s everything you need to know before scheduling your piercing appointment, whether you\\'re undecided about taking the plunge or ready to get your tongue pierced tomorrow.Meet the experts:Jenna Myers, a piercer at Live By the Sword Tattoo in New York CityErich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone HealthLynn Loheide, a body piercer based in Nashville, TennesseeAre tongue piercings dangerous?Before you even think about setting up your appointment, it\\'s important to understand the risks associated with tongue piercings. Like any piercing, there\\'s always a possibility of infection or rejection.Sometimes the signs of infection can be easy to confuse with irritation in piercings, especially if you\\'re extra paranoid. But New York City-based piercer Jenna Myers says that there tends to be a pretty big distinction between the two.\"[With an] infection, your tongue is going to look absolutely wild,\" Myers shares. \"It\\'ll be two to three times the size, turning almost green or white, [with puss].\" When that happens, she always advises going to the ER for professional help. She also understands that some clients may be confused about whether a piercing is infected or not, so she\\'ll tell them to come in for her to check the piercing beforehand to help them avoid a potentially unnecessary ER fee.Erich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone Health, notes that pus, severe tongue swelling, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and difficult breathing indicate that it\\'s time to seek out a medical professional. Typically, infected piercings are usually treated with antibiotics and the removal of jewelry, he explains.But there are some rare cases where surgery might be needed to drain an abscess or deal with any other complications, according to Dr. Voigt. For example, he once had to perform an emergency surgery on a patient because their tongue started to fill with blood and swell, leading them to choke. \"Fortunately, I was able to take the person to the operating room, remove the piercing (which was difficult because half of it became incorporated into the swollen tongue), incise the tongue, tie off a bleeding artery and well as cauterize the muscles, and then suture the tongue back together,\" Dr. Voigt shares.Luckily, not every tongue piercing will become infected. Still, it\\'s important to note that regardless of placement, the piercing can cause damage to the teeth and gums, according to piercer Lynn Loheide and Dr. Voigt. \"You need to understand that going into it, be okay with that risk, and also know what you have to do to minimize that risk,\" Loheide shares.Are horizontal \"snake eyes\" tongue piercings safe?Speaking of placement, there are restrictions as to where the tongue piercing can go. You might have heard of snake eyes before. For those who are unfamiliar, this style typically refers to a horizontal tongue piercing at the tip of the tongue. And if you had hopes of getting that piercing, keep dreaming. Unfortunately, experts say that tongue piercings should only go vertically through the tongue because horizontal placement comes with a big risk of damage to the teeth and gum recession.\"When we\\'re piercing vertically, especially in the center, we\\'re piercing through a connective tissue between those muscles,\" Loheide explains. \"But when you\\'re piercing horizontally, you\\'re actually pinning those muscles together, and that can cause a lot of damage.\" They also note that in the state of Oregon, horizontal tongue piercings are banned for this reason.Can anyone get a tongue piercing?Though everyone\\'s tongue is different, Loheide says if your tongue is too short or you have a tongue-tie — which is basically when the webbing underneath your tongue comes almost or all the way to the tip — a tongue piercing is probably not the best option for you.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen you arrive at your appointment, don\\'t be surprised if the piercer starts analyzing your mouth. In fact, that\\'s a good sign because your unique anatomy will dictate where you can and can\\'t get pierced, and any reputable piercer will ensure to take that into account, Loheide shares.\"We want to see where the blood flow is along the underside of the tongue and make sure that we\\'re not too close to it,\" they explain. \"But we also want to look at the shape of someone\\'s teeth and someone\\'s mouth when we\\'re deciding placement.\" That way, a piercer can ensure that they aren\\'t causing unnecessary damage and that the jewelry won\\'t rub up uncomfortably against your teeth.What can I expect during a tongue piercing appointment?Before your appointment, it\\'s imperative that you brush your teeth and tongue before arriving. Myers shares that typically her clients are given mouthwash right before to help clean their mouths out.As mentioned above, most of your appointment will be spent on prepping and checking your tongue before the needle is inserted. The actual piercing part of the session is short, just like most other piercings — a hollow needle is pushed through the tongue, and then the piercer adds the jewelry, which is a barbell shape.For standard tongue piercings, the ring is usually in the center of the tongue. Though horizontal piercings are a big no-no, you can still get two vertical tongue piercings. Some may call them venom piercings, but Loheide prefers to just refer to them as paired tongue piercings because for some people venom refers to two horizontal piercings, and the slang terms used change over time.\"Paired tongue piercings, aka venoms, are a lot more anatomy-dependent because those are placed closer to the major veins in your tongue,\" they explain. \"So we have to make sure that there\\'s space around that blood flow for them to be placed safely.\"Like any piercing, you should expect pain, and though it\\'s subjective, Loheide and Myers both swear that a tongue piercing is not as bad as you might think. \"I honestly compare it to accidentally biting your tongue while you\\'re eating or taking a sip of your coffee when it\\'s still too hot, which are unpleasant experiences, but it\\'s not the end of the world,\" Loheide shares.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn fact, they say that the most uncomfortable part is having the piercer\\'s hands in your mouth for an extended amount of time. Myers notes that on a scale of one to 10, most of her clients rate standard tongue piercings between a one to three, and paired tongue piercings a three to five.What does aftercare for a tongue piercing look like?There are a few things to expect immediately after your piercing. If you\\'ve been pierced before, some of these won\\'t be too shocking, but there are certain effects that are specific to tongue piercings.Right after your appointment, expect your tongue to be a bit swollen and painful for about one to two weeks, according to Loheide. That\\'s naturally going to happen because the piercing is a fresh wound. In addition to the pain and swelling, you\\'ll also deal with a slight lisp or change in how you speak. \"After about a week, the swelling will go down, and then the rest of the healing process is pretty easy,\" they share.Myers estimates that for a single tongue piercing, it will take about one to three months and three to five for paired piercings. \"Because the tongue is so vascular, it has a lot of blood flow to it, so it heals really quickly,\" she says. On the other hand, Loheide says to expect it to take about three to five months to be fully healed.Thankfully, the aftercare for tongue piercings isn\\'t too complicated. In general, maintaining good oral hygiene — brushing your teeth regularly and flossing — is important. Once you get home, Loheide recommends immediately changing out your toothbrush for a new one and using milder oral hygiene products. They advise avoiding toothpaste with whitening ingredients.Both piercers strongly suggest using an alcohol-free mouthwash that won\\'t burn your mouth. Loheide likes Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse because it doesn\\'t taste as badly as some alcohol-free mouthwashes do, it\\'s affordable, and can be found in most drug stores. Myers also recommends sterile saline solution, which tends to be recommended for most piercings.Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse$10Apart from switching up your oral products, you may have to change what you eat, but only for a short while. Myers suggests avoiding spicy, crunchy, and acidic foods in the first few weeks to avoid irritation. \"Things that you wouldn\\'t [want on] a paper cut, basically, you don\\'t want to eat the first few weeks of a tongue piercing, because it will cause serious discomfort,\" she says.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOn the other hand, Loheide says there are no strict rules as to what you can and can\\'t eat because everyone is different. But you still have to be mindful of how your mouth and tongue feel when you do eat or drink certain things. \"If you go to eat something and you\\'re like, \\'Wow, this feels terrible to eat,\\' don\\'t keep eating it,\" they share.Ultimately, try to not go overboard with your piercing aftercare, because that could potentially case more irritation. \"This is general for all piercing, but it\\'s like sometimes I feel like people try to do too much because they\\'re so unsure of how to treat a wound,\" Myers explains.\" Being as simple as possible with your aftercare is really best. Your body is really good at healing itself.\"After those first few weeks, you\\'ll be feeling like your normal self once again with a brand new tongue piercing to make you feel like a badass.Read more stories about piercings:7 Piercing Trends That Will Be Everywhere in 2022How to Remove Every Kind of Piercing Jewelry at HomeIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?Now enjoy the unboxing of the April 2022 Allure Beauty Box:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'Doja Cat is ready to travel to a galaxy far, far away.

Popularized in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, the timing for this resurgence makes sense: We\\'re already sticking Y2K-inspired rhinestones on our faces, breaking out the frosted eye shadow, and revisiting \"thong jeans\" so low-rise they would make even Paris Hilton blush. It was only a matter of time before bonding Swarovski crystal butterflies to our enamel made a comeback, too.Dental bling may be one of this year\\'s biggest beauty trends, but it\\'s nothing new. Anthropological records show that dentists as far back as the Mayan Empire decorated teeth with jade, gold, and turquoise, according to Anjali Rajpal, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California, nicknamed \"The Diamond Dentist\" on account of the bejeweled designs she creates for her celebrity clientele.Tooth jewelry also has significance in Black culture — a well-known example is grills, which were first worn by West Indian immigrants in the \\'70s and \\'90s hip-hop artists. Grills are decorative covers made of gold, silver, or encrusted with jewels that snap over one or more teeth and are removed at the end of each day. Tooth gems as we know them today differ from grills, but it\\'s important to recognize the cultures they\\'re derived from.Instead of a mouthful of precious metal, tooth gems are usually a single or a few delicate multi-colored gems or diamonds that are bonded individually to the teeth. Pinterest is clearly here for the trend, with the site reporting an 85 percent uptick in searches for \"tooth gems\" last year alone, while TikTok views for the hashtag #toothgems currently stand at 130.4m. \"Tooth gems add a little edge to someone\\'s style and are a less invasive way to make a statement than a tattoo,\" Dr. Rajpal tells Allure.Aesthetics aside, what about the dental health implications of these tiny adornments? We asked experts to share how tooth gems can be applied, and cared for, safely.Meet the Experts:Anjali Rajpal, DMD, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California.Michael Apa, DDS, an aesthetic dentist in New York City.Brian Kantor, DDS, a cosmetic dentist in New York City.How are tooth gems applied?Everyone\\'s bite is different, so there\\'s no avoiding a consultation first – sorry, dentist\\'s orders. \"[A consultation appointment] is also an opportunity to take my client\\'s style and personality into account when collaborating with them for their jewelry design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.If you\\'re choosing a semi-permanent tooth gem, no drilling is required: The technique is similar to the way braces are applied. \"An acidic solution (or etching gel) is placed on the tooth\\'s surface, microscopically roughening the enamel, before the gemstone is bonded to it with an adhesive and curing lamp,\" explains New York City-based aesthetic dentist Michael Apa. The whole process only takes a matter of minutes and is painless, provided the gem is bonded to the surface of a healthy tooth, Dr. Apa says. \"If you\\'ve got worn-away enamel from grinding your teeth or eating too many acidic foods, there will likely be sensitivity,\" he adds.Permanent tooth gems do require drilling a hole in the desired location, so be ready for the commitment if you\\'re planning on getting this adornment because it won\\'t be easy to remove. Also worth noting: While tooth gems can be bonded to veneers, Dr. Apa says they can\\'t be worn with Invisalign.How much do tooth gems cost?There\\'s no one-size-fits-all price tag. The cost will largely depend on your choice of design and materials (a Swarovski crystal, for example, will be cheaper than a diamond). Some dentists charge two separate fees – one for the gemstone and another for the application. \"My in-office fees include both and can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the size, quality, and quantity of the stones and the nature of the design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.How long do tooth gems last?Most tooth gems are semi-permanent and can last anywhere between six months to one year, says Brian Kantor, a cosmetic dentist in New York City. The right aftercare and dental materials used to bond the gemstone to the tooth will help you get the most out of your new dental jewelry.\"For the first 24 hours after getting a tooth gem, you should only eat soft foods and avoid using an electric toothbrush or drinking soda, coffee, or tea to protect the fresh bond,\" says Dr. Kantor, adding that picking or playing with your tooth gem is also off-limits. Sometimes a tooth gem may fall off on its own if you bite down hard on something, but Dr. Kantor says not to worry: \"There\\'s no harm to your tooth if that happens and the gem can simply be re-attached.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSemi-permanent tooth gems can also be safely removed by a dentist if you change your mind or want to switch up the design. “The gem is simply polished off along with any adhesive on the tooth,\" says Dr. Rajpal. As for permanent tooth gems, though, be warned that removing a permanent tooth gem that was inserted into a tooth will leave a hole. \"This hole will then need to be filled in with a white filling material that is color-matched to the existing shade of the tooth,\" adds Dr. Rajpal.Are tooth gems safe?If you ask Dr. Apa, tooth gems are purely an accessory. \"They\\'re a very specific aesthetic choice because they don\\'t offer the restorative benefits that come with veneers or crowns,\" he says. On top of not offering any benefits, there are a few dental risks that come with getting a set of gems.\"Tooth gems can trap plaque and create places for stray food particles and harmful bacteria to hide,\" Dr. Kantor explains. Needless to say, keeping the gem clean and practicing good oral hygiene is essential if you want to avoid gum inflammation, decay, or other dental issues. Alongside regular flossing, Dr. Apa recommends brushing twice a day with a non-abrasive toothpaste and soft bristle sonic toothbrush \"because the vibration offers a deeper clean and dislodges food stuck to the gemstone,\" he says.The bottom line? In general, as long as a dentist applies your chosen gem, and you\\'re taking proper care of your teeth at home, \"the risks are minimal,\" Dr. Apa says. In the wrong hands, he warns you could end up getting a gem with a rough surface that can cause traumatic lesions on the inside of the lip. \"Or if the gem isn\\'t placed properly, you can break an opposing tooth when you bite down,\" he cautions.So, I shouldn\\'t try applying tooth gems at home?Nope! Advice from dentists hasn\\'t stopped folks from taking the DIY route with nail art gems and superglue, but it should. \"It sounds obvious, but nobody should be ingesting toxic glue,\" insists Dr. Rajpal, who prefers to work with biocompatible materials such as gold and precious or semiprecious stones. \"Besides, glue doesn\\'t properly bond the gem to the tooth structure as well as dental materials,\" she explains. \"It\\'s far safer for a tooth gem to be applied by an experienced dentist, using a non-toxic material and polished to avoid any bacterial traps, as it will last longer, be more comfortable and hygienic.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesFor the same reason, Dr. Apa recommends a dentist remove the gem to avoid accidentally stripping away healthy enamel or tooth structure. \"You shouldn\\'t DIY anything in dentistry,\" he says. \"Tooth gem application is a dental procedure, and all procedures should be performed by a professional.\"More stories to take a bite into:I Took on Credit Card Debt to Get Braces as an AdultDentists Reveal the Correct Order to Brush Your Teeth, Floss, and Use MouthwashHow to Deal With Teeth Grinding and Jaw ClenchingNow, see how dental care has evolved over the last 100 years:', 'The 2022 MTV VMAs have barely even begun, and Lizzo is already stealing the show.

The last ring lay in the middle of her bottom lip.Getty ImagesThe lip ring combined with the dark blue lipstick and slicked back, wet-looking hair gave this look an edgier vibe that fit right in at the VMAs.

The Emily in Paris star may be called \"classic\" or \"glamorous,\" but the actor rarely ventures into the unconventional. And you could argue the same thing about luxury brand Cartier. But apparently, when the two get together, the trendy, off-beat coolness comes out — a Collins\\'s hair is proof.In the new ad campaign for Clash de Cartier, a jewelry collection that strikes a balance between classic and eccentric, Collins does exactly that. We see her in an elegant, asymmetrical black dress and red lipstick, and her brown hair is pulled back into a sleek, low bun, not unlike the style she wore for her wedding — basically exactly how we picture Lily Collins when we picture Lilly Collins.As Billy Idol\\'s \"Dancing With Myself\" plays, she stands in contrast with another version of herself that looks completely out of her beauty comfort zone, yet it somehow works so well. Her hair is black with of-the-moment micro bangs, and the hairstyle is complemented by bold, black liquid-liner wings and black nail polish. Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.On Tuesday, Collins teased a preview of the look, giving us a peek at the baby bangs, which appear to have been styled by Gregory Russell. The makeup looks were done by Fiona Stiles, and the manicures by nail artist Thuy Nguyen.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Although Collins recently told us that her curtain bangs are a \"dedicated decision\" that she\\'s wanted to do \"for years but never had the courage to take the plunge,\" it looks like she may be open to trying other, unexpected fringe looks. Although the micro bangs and darker hair are most likely courtesy of a wig, she can feel confident taking the plunge in real life now that she\\'s seen how cool she looks in the style.More celebrity bangs:Anya Taylor-Joy Just Got Cool-Girl Micro Bangs for SummerThe Bang Trend Celebrities Are Loving Right NowMegan Fox and Curtain Bangs Is a Better Combo Than Peanut Butter and JellyMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNow check out 100 years of bangs:Follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter for daily beauty stories delivered right to your inbox.', 'On July 2, Saweetie celebrated another trip around the sun with an extravagant birthday look that embodies the phrase \"go big or go home.\" Realistically, what else would we expect from the Cancer rapper, known for her bedazzled nails as long as lipstick tubes and bold hair colors and cuts? Her 29th birthday look has all the elements that define her signature style: inches and inches of hair, super long acrylic nails, and lots of bling.She posted a few photos of the gorgeous birthday look to Instagram on July 4, showing off her mile-long curls nearly as white as snow, pastel purple eye makeup, and baby blue nail design full of iridescent gems. She is seen in a cutout purple dress with her platinum blonde curls cascading over one of her shoulders, the ends almost grazing her knees. Though she tends to switch up her hair color often, she\\'s indulged in her blonde era many times before with this bright hue, just like when she chopped off her hair into a platinum-blonde buzz cut right at the end of 2021.The light hair color pairs beautifully with her lavender cut crease, which also complements her gown perfectly. You\\'d think the light purple shade would also make an appearance on her nails, but not at all. Instead, this stiletto manicure was painted a light blue hue, which feels like an apt choice for the water sign. Each icy blue nail was filled with opalescent jewels of various sizes running straight down the middle. We swear these pointy claws are longer than her own fingers — it might be one of the longest sets she has had to date.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Saweetie\\'s birthday look is as gorgeous and icy as we expected. Her blinged-out nails, flashy jewelry covering her wrists and fingers, and inches of platinum-blonde waves represent her style so well.

On the 2022 red carpet, it has come in the form of elaborate headpieces, an overwhelming amount of black attire for a white-tie event, and some very funky hairstyles — especially including that of Alicia Keys.Keys walked the red carpet on May 2 in a black gown, completed by a cape bedazzled with the New York City skyline (how fitting for the singer who wrote the concrete-jungle-wet-dream-tomato song). When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection. When is it not?Getty ImagesThen I caught a look at her long braid from the side and the back and now I'm bewildered by… whatever is in her hair. As you can see below, Keys's braid is — I don't even know what word to use here — woven? Woven with something I'm finding very hard to describe. It's like a black-and-silver ribbon… made out of CDs… bedazzled CDs?Getty ImagesIn short, I have no idea what is going on with this hairstyle or what to call it, but it looks damn good. Then again, Alicia Keys could've rocked up to the Met Gala in a garbage can and she still would've made it look soulfully chic. It's what she does best.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King's Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNeed more?

And while it's all too common for some to slouch when it comes to following the theme of the night, one guest nailed it in the gilded glamor department at the 2022 Met Gala. Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers. It was shiny gold and covered in ruby and pearl-looking appliqués. She also sported a gold, armor-esque covering on her other pointer finger. The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore. Somehow, it was both a retro and futuristic look all at once. And one that set the hearts of internet critics aflame.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.King kept the rest of her beauty look simple, with cropped hair and minimal-looking makeup. Because why take attention away from the nail situation? It's especially impressive to see the manicure from far away, where you can really notice how long it is.Best of luck to King if she wants to pick anything up today —those nails won't make it easy — but we do appreciate a spiced-up manicure that follows the evening's trend.

If that wasn\\'t enough, the \"Kiss Me More\" singer made our jaws drop with the stunning Schiaparelli black gown and gold accessories she wore for the awards show. By now we expect the pop star to capture our attention with every new look, but we didn\\'t expect her to show up to the event with short nails or intricate gold rings that look like they\\'re worth more than my student loans.The \"Say So\" singer didn\\'t hesitate to take risks for this look, something we love from her. Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas gave her a neutral smokey eye with a hint of bright yellow on the inner crease and waterline that complemented the daring gown very well. As for her hair, hairstylist Jared Henderson (known as JStay Ready to many) slicked her dark hair into a high ponytail with a flipped end that we have a good feeling was fun to whip around.Getty ImagesTypically Doja Cat wears lengthy nails, but for this look, she kept them short. Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe. But this manicure is anything but simple, because this opulent jewelry is basically nail art.Her middle finger had the largest ring, which covered her entire finger and nail. The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own. The other two rings were simpler, which is saying something. Two golden nail rings wrapped around her thumb and index finger.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesDoja Cat always has fun beauty looks, whether it\\'s a brightly colored wig or simple nude nails with a colorful accent.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one! What else can we pierce?Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"And then it literally never healed. The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me. I\\'m going to keep it forever.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookI Got a Tragus Piercing — Here\\'s What You Should Know Before Getting OneNow, see 100 years of piercings in less than three minutes:', 'To me, tragus piercings always stood for college rebellion. One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade.

Yep, it\\'s equally as disappointing when you find an eye-catching set of earrings only to find it\\'s made of materials that could irritate your skin. Sure, they say pain is beauty, but when that pain involves itchiness, redness, and uncomfortable rashes (on an already-thin and sensitive part of your skin, no less), it begs the question: \"were these hoops really worth it?\" The short answer is, well, no.And remember: you\\'ll know if your piercing is infected if it\\'s red, inflamed, sore, hot to touch, or if it\\'s releasing puss. You should consult with your physician if you suspect you have an infection.The truth is, if you\\'re someone who struggles with finding earrings that won\\'t cause discomfort, you may have to work a little harder to find your match. \"Unfortunately, sterling silver jewelry is made with a mix of metals, often nickel, which is the most significant irritant to sensitive ears,\" explains Ottawa-based medical director of Concept Medical Samuel Hetz, MD. \"Those with sensitive ears want to find hypoallergenic rhodium-plated jewelry with low to no nickel content.\" He recommends looking for the standard benchmarks of 14k gold or above as well as sterling silver 925 grade to reduce the chances of nickel content.Because we don\\'t believe those with sensitive skin should be left out of the party, we rounded up nine of the best earrings for sensitive ears that are always stylish, and never irritating.BaubleBar Sutara 18K Gold Earrings$48 at BaubleBar$42 at NordstromFor sensitive-skinned folks, Baublebar\\'s Sutara Earrings will make you thank your lucky stars they\\'re made out of 18k gold.

All around me were people filling in or touching up their ink, but I continued onward past the buzzing needles — straight to the back, where the piercer works. After a tough year, I was ready for a bit of body modification to memorialize the challenges and symbolize the jump forward into 2022. What I didn\\'t realize, as I asked for a third lobe piercing to continue to build my stack of hoops, is that my bright idea was of a pace with a wide new piercing trend.More and more customers are asking for what Alaina Rothstein, cofounder of Los Angeles ear piercing service Leo West, refers to as a \"milestone piercing.\" Rothstein has seen mothers and daughters come in for birthday piercing; she knows of a woman who miscarried and got a stud to remind her of the loss. \"It\\'s a fun, really beautiful way to carry something special with you in happy times and in sad times,\" she says. \"And I think it\\'s like super cool that it\\'s translated [from the tattoo world] into the piercing world.\"Our piercers have seen birthdays, bachelorette parties, and groups of friends come in to celebrate together. But what trends are they trying, specifically? In other words, which parts of the ear are getting the most adoration through adornment right now?Meet the experts:Alaina Rothstein and Jill Katz, RN, cofounders of Los Angeles ear-piercing service Leo WestLisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a piercing studio with locations in New York, Texas, and California (among others)Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer at Live by the Sword Tattoo in Brooklyn, New YorkIn This Story:Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?How to Pick Your PiercerConstellation PiercingsStacked LobesVertical StacksForward HelixSnakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)ConchOuter Conch, a.k.a. SconchJump ahead, or read on for everything you need to know about the freshest ear-piercing trends, as well as the estimated length of time the healing process may take.Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?Milestones are one reason customers are flocking to their local licensed piercer, but another is a generalized sense of freedom and autonomy that\\'s arrived as a result of the pandemic. \"With remote work and workplace norms overall changing, more people are feeling free to experiment with bolder looks and express their personality,\" says Lisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a national piercing studio. That experimentation shows up both in the amount of piercings and in the piercings themselves, which are getting \"more creative,\" Bubbers says. (Plus, as Rothstein points out, \"one fun thing about mask-wearing is that your ears show.\")The last \"really important trend,\" as Leo West cofounder Jill Katz, RN describes it, is \"adorning what you got.\" There\\'s no normal, she says. A gorgeous earscape is all about working with your budget and your anatomy to create an embodiment of your style in tiny, beautiful silver, gold, or gem form.The result: forward helices, vertically stacked lobes, conches, sconches, snake bites, and plenty of other piercing types we never knew existed, spanning from the outer rims of the ear to the inner cartilage and back to the earlobe. Our trend-spotting piercers shared the adornments they\\'ve seen grow more popular over 2022, and what they envision for the years (and ears!) to come.How to Pick Your PiercerJust as with microblading, filler, or any other body modification, it\\'s important to find a professional piercer that you trust, with a style that appeals to you. This is an essential step, whether you’re a longtime body modification fan or it’s your first piercing ever.As Brooks notes, the benefit of following a piercer on social media is that you can seek them out and, as in one service she offers, put your ear(s) in her hands. During a \"curation\" appointment, the expert will look at your ear as a whole and help design multiple piercings to fit your style and your desires.At Leo West, that might look like getting multiple differentiated piercings on each ear. \"Symmetry is out,\" says Rothstein. As she points out, a specialist is extra helpful if you\\'re nervous about curating an asymmetrical look. \"It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t want ears that match, but it has to have a rhyme or reason to it,\" she says. \"I have two ears, and I like to say ‘one’s a little bit classy, one\\'s a little bit sassy.\\'\"Constellation PiercingsInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhile some of this year\\'s trends include holes in unexpected places, more of them involve third, fourth, or fifth additions to an already-pierced ear. At Leo West, the result is what they\\'ve named a \"constellation.\" A constellation consists of \"really small pieces, close together, closer than what your traditional spacing would be,\" explains Rothstein. The result is an \"intentionally random\" grouping of ear piercings that show off studs and gems.Stacked LobesInstagram user @leowestco\"People often come in [to the studio] and say \\'I’m not cool enough,\\'\" for a trendy piercing, recounts Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer in Brooklyn. If you\\'re intimidated by the thought of a conch piercing or even a constellation, Brooks thinks that an ear stack is an easier entry point. These piercings are less painful than their cartilage-filled brethren, and can make their way up the lobe either evenly spaced or placed close together.Vertical StacksInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"If I\\'m being honest, I love to put my hair behind my ear to show the little pops of pieces sitting right above your classic [piercing],\" laughs Rothstein. She\\'s referring to a vertical stack, which entails a piercing centered directly above your traditional first or second hole. It\\'s usually filled with a small stone or a small star, Rothstein\\'s favorite. This piercing does require a certain amount of space on the lobe, but if you have enough canvas to play with, it \"gives the ear a little extra uniqueness.\"Forward Helixcourtesy of StudsThe official name for that bouncy piece of cartilage where your ear meets your skull is the \"forward helix.\" According to Bubbers, customers are coming in requesting one or even multiple piercings on the forward helix. \"We do see new and different piercing trends emerge each year based on what’s trending in fashion, culture, and celebrity,\" she says. Celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Chantal Jeffries have helped popularize the new (and finicky — helix piercings can take up to nine months to heal) style.Snakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)In the realm of body piercing, the term \"snakebite\" typically refers to two piercings on either side of your lower lip, oftentimes barbells or studs.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen it comes to ears, however, it entails two holes placed close together, slightly separated from the rest of your ear piercings, giving the impression of that your piercer just might have used two fangs to get the job done. According to Bubbers, most customers opt for a snakebite in their “midi,\" the center point of the outer ear.ConchInstagram user @leowestcoWe\\'ve named conch piercings as of-trend for the past few years, but the cartilage piercing is still popular enough to remain on the list. It pierces through the inner-ear cartilage that makes up the back of the year. At Studs, Bubbers says customers are opting more and more for a snakebite on the conch for a doubly trendy effect.Outer Conch (Sometimes Known as a \"Sconch\")courtesy of Studs\"I hope you don\\'t use this name,\" laughs Brooks. She prefers the more medical-sounding \"outer conch,\" but the phrase \"sconch\" is catching on to describe a piercing placed at the lining ridge in the cavern space close to the center of the ear.\"It\\'s right in your eye-line when people look at you,\" she says, so it provides a way to show a bit of personality even when you\\'re on Zoom or wearing a mask. Because it\\'ll be eye-catching no matter what kind of earring(s) you have in, Brooks likes adorning an outer conch piercing with a piece of jewelry that makes a big statement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesMore on the world of piercings:How Tongue Piercings Work, From Pain Level and Placement to Aftercare and Healing TimeHow to Remove Every Type of Piercing at Home8 Types of Ear Piercings, ExplainedContraconch Ear Piercings Are Gaining Popularity for Its Unexpected PlacementIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?

That way, I have a scent memory anchored to that destination or time period for whenever I choose to relive it. My last international trip, to a prestigious wellness resort in Austria for some on-the-ground reporting, demanded a very specific choice: something compact enough to fit in my carry-on without getting tossed by TSA, calming enough to match the vibe of the Alpine oasis, and extra long-lasting so it would last through hikes, meals, and medical treatments without reapplication. Lastly, it would need to smell expensive, because my fellow wellness-seekers would expect as much — but we\\'ll get to that later.After much deliberation, I landed on a luxe new formula that had just hit my desk before my flight: the Jennifer Fisher My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil.My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil$65I was initially surprised that Jennifer Fisher, a jewelry designer beloved by her red carpet clientele and the master behind some of Jennifer Lopez\\'s favorite hoop earrings, had ventured into perfumery. That said, fragrance does feel like a sparkling accessory that amps up any outfit or beauty look, and Fisher wanted her new perfume oil to make a statement for the wearer. \"I want anyone wearing My Scent to feel confident and sexy,\" she tells Allure. “And to smell like a fresh baked cookie.\" Upon first wear, I didn\\'t flag baked goods as a top note, but I did instantly fall for the vanilla and coconut Fisher knew she wanted to include in the formula.\"The blend of vanilla and coconut brings back memories from my childhood growing up in Santa Barbara, California,\" she says. \"For years, I was combining different vanilla and coconut fragrances to try and create my own personal scent. Finding a scent that was a combination of surf wax from the beaches in my hometown, Montecito, and a fresh baked cookie is what I\\'ve always wanted.\"Australian sandalwood, pear, and Tonka bean flank the creamy hero notes, and it all comes together to smell equal parts sunny and cozy, like throwing on a cashmere sweater on a breezy summer night. Toting it around is just as effortless too: I carried the teeny-tiny rollerball in my airplane carry-on, my spa robe to and from massages and lunch, and even in my fanny pack while Nordic walking in the mountains.No, really, I took this tube everywhere with me.\\nTaylore Glynn\"I wanted to come out with something small, compact, and portable you could throw in your bag and take everywhere with you,\" says Fisher. \"A spray to me didn\\'t feel as transportable, but that doesn\\'t mean I am ruling it out for the next product. This oil was designed intentionally to be worn and carried on-the-go.\" In addition to being totable, the formula also fulfilled my need for something that would last through spa treatments and saunas.\"Coconut is a good oil carrier to round out scents,\" says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, noting that scent can last longer in oil form because it\\'s not watered down. \"Atomized scents usually contain alcohol to help spraying. Fragrance oil is the most concentrated form [you can find].\"The scent was so powerful that even my fellow resort guests noticed. In fact, I was flagged down multiple times in the dining room and in the halls to reveal what I was wearing because it smelled \"beautiful\" and \"divine.\" For important context, some of the resort guests on the premises at the time — who I can\\'t explicitly identify — included one of the most famous supermodels of our generation, an Oscar-winning actress, and an entirely different famous jewelry designer with whom I chatted about ketamine therapy. I realized that My Scent smelled flat-out expensive, which seems to be a selling point amongst perfume enthusiasts on social media. In fact, there\\'s a whole genre of #FragranceTok posts dedicated to perfumes that make you smell, well, rich. After studying these videos, there\\'s a handful of perfumes that seem to universally smell like wealth: Parfums de Marly Delina, Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Montale Paris Intense Cafe, and three different Maison Francis Kurkdjian perfumes.Courtesy of brandParfums de Marly Delina$335Courtesy of brandYves Saint Laurent Libre Eau de Parfum Spray$140 $112 at NordstromIntense Cafe Eau de Parfum$170Courtesy of brandMaison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540$325They all also happen to share one intoxicating note: vanilla, which lies at the heart of My Scent. Even better, the perfume oil clocks in at $65, which is hundreds of dollars cheaper than some of these other expensive-smelling options.

Well, we say it's time to take a moment to appreciate such bold choices, such as Doja Cat's quirky makeup looks from Paris Fashion week — she still has us wondering how her shirt remained white with all that gold. And we certainly can't leave out the Hadid sisters' bleached brows for their own prance down the very same runways. It's not much of a shocker, then, that Gigi Hadid went for something a bit odd and definitely bold for a recent red-carpet beauty moment. For the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards on November 7, Hadid graced the carpet with an unconventional cool gray lipstick.I'll be the first to admit that I did a double-take at first glimpse. No, it's not your typical choice where a lipstick shade is concerned, but makeup artists Patrick Ta and Akina Shimizu were able to pull off this muted-yet-fresh-faced makeup look on Hadid. Catch me zooming in on those lips that are seemingly matte and glossy at the same time. We're definitely not the only ones hoping the details will soon be dropped on what particular beauty brand this lipstick is made by. Nonetheless, this all-American color pallet is insanely cohesive.Let's also not forget the striking blonde hair color and the sleek, slicked-back bun hair stylist Laura Polko put together to bring out the jewelry on Hadid's ears and nose.

The supermodel went for a runway-ready vibe for both of her costumes this year, though they were extremely different in tone.For her first look, Bieber covered herself in roses to pay homage to an Yves Saint Laurent haute couture runway look from 1999, originally worn by model Laetitia Casta. In her carousel of pics, Bieber wears a top and miniskirt made of huge pink roses, enhanced by a matching pink organza ruffled train at her hips. Roses also pop up on one ankle and serve as a flower crown atop her head. The look is very The Birth of Venus but make it fashion —and floral.Bieber let the roses be the centerpiece of her costume and kept her hair and makeup subtle and natural with radiant \"glazed\" skin, deep rose lips, and a hint of shimmery pink eye shadow, then finished off the costume with a pale pink and white manicure. She wore no jewelry or accessories other than her engagement diamond and a pair of pale pink ankle-strap sandals. While Casta wore the rose look with Raphaelite ringlet curls, Bieber decided on loose brunette waves for a more modern approach. I just have one question, Hailey: Are those real roses? Hopefully, you de-thorned them if so!Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Later on during Halloweekend, Bieber ditched the angelic florals of her first costume in favor of something darker: a \"Versace Vampire.\" The model donned a strappy black bustier top and high-waisted black skirt with a black and gold Versace logo belt, opera-length shiny black latex gloves, and a pair of vampire fangs for the Goth-inspired vampire moment. A black wig, bright purple eyeshadow, flushed cheeks, and blood-red lips (obviously), plus chunky gold necklaces and huge gold and pearl earrings added to the glamourous \\'90s Versace vibe; she could have walked right off a Gianni Versace runway, minus the fangs.Instagram/Hailey BieberThe two looks may have been complete opposites, but they paid homage to Bieber\\'s fashion roots in the most gorgeously spooky and stunning way.More celeb Halloween looks you may have missed:The Kardashian\\'s Halloween Costumes Included Mystique, Bride of Frankenstein and Jessie from Toy StoryYou Have to See Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly as Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee for HalloweenMegan Thee Stallion Has Outdone Herself in the Halloween Nail Art DepartmentMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNow, learn Hailey\\'s 10 biggest beauty tips:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'TikTok-turned-reality star Dixie D\\'Amelio finally committed to the hairstyle she\\'s been longing for since sixth grade.

You can find plenty of examples across social media. Just look to hashtags #tonguepiercing and #tonguepiercings on TikTok and Instagram, which have over 790 million views and 520,000 posts, respectively.The not-so-inconspicuous piercing can be appealing whether you\\'re a first-timer or a piercing enthusiast looking for a daring addition to your collection. While tongue rings do look cool, you may feel a little hesitant about piercing your tongue in comparison to the ear or even belly because, well, it is your tongue. The stakes seem higher and more dangerous should an infection occur.But despite the location, the aftercare for tongue piercings is actually a lot easier (and a lot less painful) than some would expect. Here\\'s everything you need to know before scheduling your piercing appointment, whether you\\'re undecided about taking the plunge or ready to get your tongue pierced tomorrow.Meet the experts:Jenna Myers, a piercer at Live By the Sword Tattoo in New York CityErich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone HealthLynn Loheide, a body piercer based in Nashville, TennesseeAre tongue piercings dangerous?Before you even think about setting up your appointment, it\\'s important to understand the risks associated with tongue piercings. Like any piercing, there\\'s always a possibility of infection or rejection.Sometimes the signs of infection can be easy to confuse with irritation in piercings, especially if you\\'re extra paranoid. But New York City-based piercer Jenna Myers says that there tends to be a pretty big distinction between the two.\"[With an] infection, your tongue is going to look absolutely wild,\" Myers shares. \"It\\'ll be two to three times the size, turning almost green or white, [with puss].\" When that happens, she always advises going to the ER for professional help. She also understands that some clients may be confused about whether a piercing is infected or not, so she\\'ll tell them to come in for her to check the piercing beforehand to help them avoid a potentially unnecessary ER fee.Erich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone Health, notes that pus, severe tongue swelling, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and difficult breathing indicate that it\\'s time to seek out a medical professional. Typically, infected piercings are usually treated with antibiotics and the removal of jewelry, he explains.But there are some rare cases where surgery might be needed to drain an abscess or deal with any other complications, according to Dr. Voigt. For example, he once had to perform an emergency surgery on a patient because their tongue started to fill with blood and swell, leading them to choke. \"Fortunately, I was able to take the person to the operating room, remove the piercing (which was difficult because half of it became incorporated into the swollen tongue), incise the tongue, tie off a bleeding artery and well as cauterize the muscles, and then suture the tongue back together,\" Dr. Voigt shares.Luckily, not every tongue piercing will become infected. Still, it\\'s important to note that regardless of placement, the piercing can cause damage to the teeth and gums, according to piercer Lynn Loheide and Dr. Voigt. \"You need to understand that going into it, be okay with that risk, and also know what you have to do to minimize that risk,\" Loheide shares.Are horizontal \"snake eyes\" tongue piercings safe?Speaking of placement, there are restrictions as to where the tongue piercing can go. You might have heard of snake eyes before. For those who are unfamiliar, this style typically refers to a horizontal tongue piercing at the tip of the tongue. And if you had hopes of getting that piercing, keep dreaming. Unfortunately, experts say that tongue piercings should only go vertically through the tongue because horizontal placement comes with a big risk of damage to the teeth and gum recession.\"When we\\'re piercing vertically, especially in the center, we\\'re piercing through a connective tissue between those muscles,\" Loheide explains. \"But when you\\'re piercing horizontally, you\\'re actually pinning those muscles together, and that can cause a lot of damage.\" They also note that in the state of Oregon, horizontal tongue piercings are banned for this reason.Can anyone get a tongue piercing?Though everyone\\'s tongue is different, Loheide says if your tongue is too short or you have a tongue-tie — which is basically when the webbing underneath your tongue comes almost or all the way to the tip — a tongue piercing is probably not the best option for you.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen you arrive at your appointment, don\\'t be surprised if the piercer starts analyzing your mouth. In fact, that\\'s a good sign because your unique anatomy will dictate where you can and can\\'t get pierced, and any reputable piercer will ensure to take that into account, Loheide shares.\"We want to see where the blood flow is along the underside of the tongue and make sure that we\\'re not too close to it,\" they explain. \"But we also want to look at the shape of someone\\'s teeth and someone\\'s mouth when we\\'re deciding placement.\" That way, a piercer can ensure that they aren\\'t causing unnecessary damage and that the jewelry won\\'t rub up uncomfortably against your teeth.What can I expect during a tongue piercing appointment?Before your appointment, it\\'s imperative that you brush your teeth and tongue before arriving. Myers shares that typically her clients are given mouthwash right before to help clean their mouths out.As mentioned above, most of your appointment will be spent on prepping and checking your tongue before the needle is inserted. The actual piercing part of the session is short, just like most other piercings — a hollow needle is pushed through the tongue, and then the piercer adds the jewelry, which is a barbell shape.For standard tongue piercings, the ring is usually in the center of the tongue. Though horizontal piercings are a big no-no, you can still get two vertical tongue piercings. Some may call them venom piercings, but Loheide prefers to just refer to them as paired tongue piercings because for some people venom refers to two horizontal piercings, and the slang terms used change over time.\"Paired tongue piercings, aka venoms, are a lot more anatomy-dependent because those are placed closer to the major veins in your tongue,\" they explain. \"So we have to make sure that there\\'s space around that blood flow for them to be placed safely.\"Like any piercing, you should expect pain, and though it\\'s subjective, Loheide and Myers both swear that a tongue piercing is not as bad as you might think. \"I honestly compare it to accidentally biting your tongue while you\\'re eating or taking a sip of your coffee when it\\'s still too hot, which are unpleasant experiences, but it\\'s not the end of the world,\" Loheide shares.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn fact, they say that the most uncomfortable part is having the piercer\\'s hands in your mouth for an extended amount of time. Myers notes that on a scale of one to 10, most of her clients rate standard tongue piercings between a one to three, and paired tongue piercings a three to five.What does aftercare for a tongue piercing look like?There are a few things to expect immediately after your piercing. If you\\'ve been pierced before, some of these won\\'t be too shocking, but there are certain effects that are specific to tongue piercings.Right after your appointment, expect your tongue to be a bit swollen and painful for about one to two weeks, according to Loheide. That\\'s naturally going to happen because the piercing is a fresh wound. In addition to the pain and swelling, you\\'ll also deal with a slight lisp or change in how you speak. \"After about a week, the swelling will go down, and then the rest of the healing process is pretty easy,\" they share.Myers estimates that for a single tongue piercing, it will take about one to three months and three to five for paired piercings. \"Because the tongue is so vascular, it has a lot of blood flow to it, so it heals really quickly,\" she says. On the other hand, Loheide says to expect it to take about three to five months to be fully healed.Thankfully, the aftercare for tongue piercings isn\\'t too complicated. In general, maintaining good oral hygiene — brushing your teeth regularly and flossing — is important. Once you get home, Loheide recommends immediately changing out your toothbrush for a new one and using milder oral hygiene products. They advise avoiding toothpaste with whitening ingredients.Both piercers strongly suggest using an alcohol-free mouthwash that won\\'t burn your mouth. Loheide likes Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse because it doesn\\'t taste as badly as some alcohol-free mouthwashes do, it\\'s affordable, and can be found in most drug stores. Myers also recommends sterile saline solution, which tends to be recommended for most piercings.Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse$10Apart from switching up your oral products, you may have to change what you eat, but only for a short while. Myers suggests avoiding spicy, crunchy, and acidic foods in the first few weeks to avoid irritation. \"Things that you wouldn\\'t [want on] a paper cut, basically, you don\\'t want to eat the first few weeks of a tongue piercing, because it will cause serious discomfort,\" she says.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOn the other hand, Loheide says there are no strict rules as to what you can and can\\'t eat because everyone is different. But you still have to be mindful of how your mouth and tongue feel when you do eat or drink certain things. \"If you go to eat something and you\\'re like, \\'Wow, this feels terrible to eat,\\' don\\'t keep eating it,\" they share.Ultimately, try to not go overboard with your piercing aftercare, because that could potentially case more irritation. \"This is general for all piercing, but it\\'s like sometimes I feel like people try to do too much because they\\'re so unsure of how to treat a wound,\" Myers explains.\" Being as simple as possible with your aftercare is really best. Your body is really good at healing itself.\"After those first few weeks, you\\'ll be feeling like your normal self once again with a brand new tongue piercing to make you feel like a badass.Read more stories about piercings:7 Piercing Trends That Will Be Everywhere in 2022How to Remove Every Kind of Piercing Jewelry at HomeIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?Now enjoy the unboxing of the April 2022 Allure Beauty Box:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'Doja Cat is ready to travel to a galaxy far, far away.

The grunge-inspired palette includes shades of rust, murky green, and gold; Doja applied a taupe shade across her lid and added a pop of green at her inner corners, then applied just a touch of mascara. The final touch? A heavily lined lip with a shimmery gloss applied atop for more next-dimension sparkle.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.One thing we love about Doja is that she\\'s completely fearless when it comes to her hair and makeup. She\\'s not afraid to try something new, whether that\\'s coating her entire body in gold, painting her face white and blue, or shaving her eyebrows on Instagram Live. In August, she let fans watch as she said \"See ya!\" to her brows, saying that it was time for a change. \"I never liked having hair. I cannot tell you one time, since the beginning of my life, that I\\'ve ever been like, \\'This is cool. I just do not like to have hair,\\'\" she said in the Live. After some criticism of her shaved head and brows, Doja spoke out, saying she doesn\\'t care if she\\'s \"fuckable\" by modern beauty standards. The baby bangs made their first appearance in mid-October and the rapper seems to be feeling the look, experimenting with wigs in similar silhouettes.Doja does her own thing, and that\\'s what makes her such a beauty icon.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOtherworldy inspiration from Doja starts here:Doja Cat Truly Snapped When She Made This Galactic 3D Manicure HerselfDoja Cat\\'s Gold Nail Jewelry Is Better Than Nail PolishDoja Cat Piled On the \\'90s Beauty Trends for the Grammys Red CarpetNow, see how eye makeup has evolved within the past 100 years:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'Another day, another Megan Thee Stallion manicure that makes our hearts flutter — this time literally.On July 18, the rapper showed off her new nail art alongside a peek at a new diamond necklace via Instagram, where she posted a video of her well-deserved \"treat yourself\" moment. \"Decided to treat myself since I been working so harddd,\" Megan wrote of the braided Eliantte diamond necklace and matching ring, which she wears on her forefinger in the video.

Each coffin-shaped nail is embellished with adorable airbrushed butterflies and hearts for a sweet, summery touch.

Her hair was the perfect pairing for the graphic black-and-white ensemble with the length hitting past her hips to brush her lower back tattoo, adding to the minimal-yet-funky elements of her outfit. (If you\\'re curious, the tattoo reads \"Renaissance woman.\") The braids, bustier, and slim skirt gave us a \\'90s vibe and could truly be at home in 1998 or 2028.As for her makeup look, Palmer kept things simple with flawless, glowing skin, lots of lashes, and a glossy lip, an ideal choice for hot summer evenings.Palmer is the ultimate hair chameleon. She changes up her look often and experiments with all kinds of styles just as easily as she can make a pit stop on Sesame Street then pivot to star in a supernatural horror movie.

In 2021, she said that although she was \"so scared\" to make the big chop, it was something she needed to do. \"I really wanted to regain the confidence I had as a kid when it came to my hair in its natural state, while still being able to explore a wig or a weave or anything!\" Keke wrote in an Instagram post at the time. \"I just never wanted to feel like I needed it more than the actual hair on my head.\"Whether she\\'s rocking curls, braids, or space buns, Keke always serves up hair inspiration that\\'s as fun and fabulous as she is.

Popularized in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, the timing for this resurgence makes sense: We\\'re already sticking Y2K-inspired rhinestones on our faces, breaking out the frosted eye shadow, and revisiting \"thong jeans\" so low-rise they would make even Paris Hilton blush. It was only a matter of time before bonding Swarovski crystal butterflies to our enamel made a comeback, too.Dental bling may be one of this year\\'s biggest beauty trends, but it\\'s nothing new. Anthropological records show that dentists as far back as the Mayan Empire decorated teeth with jade, gold, and turquoise, according to Anjali Rajpal, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California, nicknamed \"The Diamond Dentist\" on account of the bejeweled designs she creates for her celebrity clientele.Tooth jewelry also has significance in Black culture — a well-known example is grills, which were first worn by West Indian immigrants in the \\'70s and \\'90s hip-hop artists. Grills are decorative covers made of gold, silver, or encrusted with jewels that snap over one or more teeth and are removed at the end of each day. Tooth gems as we know them today differ from grills, but it\\'s important to recognize the cultures they\\'re derived from.Instead of a mouthful of precious metal, tooth gems are usually a single or a few delicate multi-colored gems or diamonds that are bonded individually to the teeth. Pinterest is clearly here for the trend, with the site reporting an 85 percent uptick in searches for \"tooth gems\" last year alone, while TikTok views for the hashtag #toothgems currently stand at 130.4m. \"Tooth gems add a little edge to someone\\'s style and are a less invasive way to make a statement than a tattoo,\" Dr. Rajpal tells Allure.Aesthetics aside, what about the dental health implications of these tiny adornments? We asked experts to share how tooth gems can be applied, and cared for, safely.Meet the Experts:Anjali Rajpal, DMD, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California.Michael Apa, DDS, an aesthetic dentist in New York City.Brian Kantor, DDS, a cosmetic dentist in New York City.How are tooth gems applied?Everyone\\'s bite is different, so there\\'s no avoiding a consultation first – sorry, dentist\\'s orders. \"[A consultation appointment] is also an opportunity to take my client\\'s style and personality into account when collaborating with them for their jewelry design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.If you\\'re choosing a semi-permanent tooth gem, no drilling is required: The technique is similar to the way braces are applied. \"An acidic solution (or etching gel) is placed on the tooth\\'s surface, microscopically roughening the enamel, before the gemstone is bonded to it with an adhesive and curing lamp,\" explains New York City-based aesthetic dentist Michael Apa. The whole process only takes a matter of minutes and is painless, provided the gem is bonded to the surface of a healthy tooth, Dr. Apa says. \"If you\\'ve got worn-away enamel from grinding your teeth or eating too many acidic foods, there will likely be sensitivity,\" he adds.Permanent tooth gems do require drilling a hole in the desired location, so be ready for the commitment if you\\'re planning on getting this adornment because it won\\'t be easy to remove. Also worth noting: While tooth gems can be bonded to veneers, Dr. Apa says they can\\'t be worn with Invisalign.How much do tooth gems cost?There\\'s no one-size-fits-all price tag. The cost will largely depend on your choice of design and materials (a Swarovski crystal, for example, will be cheaper than a diamond). Some dentists charge two separate fees – one for the gemstone and another for the application. \"My in-office fees include both and can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the size, quality, and quantity of the stones and the nature of the design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.How long do tooth gems last?Most tooth gems are semi-permanent and can last anywhere between six months to one year, says Brian Kantor, a cosmetic dentist in New York City. The right aftercare and dental materials used to bond the gemstone to the tooth will help you get the most out of your new dental jewelry.\"For the first 24 hours after getting a tooth gem, you should only eat soft foods and avoid using an electric toothbrush or drinking soda, coffee, or tea to protect the fresh bond,\" says Dr. Kantor, adding that picking or playing with your tooth gem is also off-limits. Sometimes a tooth gem may fall off on its own if you bite down hard on something, but Dr. Kantor says not to worry: \"There\\'s no harm to your tooth if that happens and the gem can simply be re-attached.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSemi-permanent tooth gems can also be safely removed by a dentist if you change your mind or want to switch up the design. “The gem is simply polished off along with any adhesive on the tooth,\" says Dr. Rajpal. As for permanent tooth gems, though, be warned that removing a permanent tooth gem that was inserted into a tooth will leave a hole. \"This hole will then need to be filled in with a white filling material that is color-matched to the existing shade of the tooth,\" adds Dr. Rajpal.Are tooth gems safe?If you ask Dr. Apa, tooth gems are purely an accessory. \"They\\'re a very specific aesthetic choice because they don\\'t offer the restorative benefits that come with veneers or crowns,\" he says. On top of not offering any benefits, there are a few dental risks that come with getting a set of gems.\"Tooth gems can trap plaque and create places for stray food particles and harmful bacteria to hide,\" Dr. Kantor explains. Needless to say, keeping the gem clean and practicing good oral hygiene is essential if you want to avoid gum inflammation, decay, or other dental issues. Alongside regular flossing, Dr. Apa recommends brushing twice a day with a non-abrasive toothpaste and soft bristle sonic toothbrush \"because the vibration offers a deeper clean and dislodges food stuck to the gemstone,\" he says.The bottom line? In general, as long as a dentist applies your chosen gem, and you\\'re taking proper care of your teeth at home, \"the risks are minimal,\" Dr. Apa says. In the wrong hands, he warns you could end up getting a gem with a rough surface that can cause traumatic lesions on the inside of the lip. \"Or if the gem isn\\'t placed properly, you can break an opposing tooth when you bite down,\" he cautions.So, I shouldn\\'t try applying tooth gems at home?Nope! Advice from dentists hasn\\'t stopped folks from taking the DIY route with nail art gems and superglue, but it should. \"It sounds obvious, but nobody should be ingesting toxic glue,\" insists Dr. Rajpal, who prefers to work with biocompatible materials such as gold and precious or semiprecious stones. \"Besides, glue doesn\\'t properly bond the gem to the tooth structure as well as dental materials,\" she explains. \"It\\'s far safer for a tooth gem to be applied by an experienced dentist, using a non-toxic material and polished to avoid any bacterial traps, as it will last longer, be more comfortable and hygienic.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesFor the same reason, Dr. Apa recommends a dentist remove the gem to avoid accidentally stripping away healthy enamel or tooth structure. \"You shouldn\\'t DIY anything in dentistry,\" he says. \"Tooth gem application is a dental procedure, and all procedures should be performed by a professional.\"More stories to take a bite into:I Took on Credit Card Debt to Get Braces as an AdultDentists Reveal the Correct Order to Brush Your Teeth, Floss, and Use MouthwashHow to Deal With Teeth Grinding and Jaw ClenchingNow, see how dental care has evolved over the last 100 years:', 'The 2022 MTV VMAs have barely even begun, and Lizzo is already stealing the show. The \"About Damn Time\" singer arrived at the awards show in an ensemble that was almost as dark as the black carpet she walked on. She looked like she could be princess of the underworld or even a gothic cake topper with her massive navy blue gown, dark lipstick, and golden rings on her ears, fingers, and lips.Where do you even start with a look like this? The singer\\'s navy blue gown was a gorgeous rumpled, off-the-shoulder dress from Jean Paul Gaultier. She paired it with sheer navy blue gloves that covered her forearms.Her golden jewelry was as excessive as her stunning gown in all the best ways possible. On both of her ring fingers, she wore an abstract looped ring. Earrings of various sizes covered her entire cartilage and lobe. The rings along her cartilage were thicker in width but smaller in circumference, so they hugged her ear. The hoops on the lobe were much larger, nearly skimming her shoulders. The last ring lay in the middle of her bottom lip.Getty ImagesThe lip ring combined with the dark blue lipstick and slicked back, wet-looking hair gave this look an edgier vibe that fit right in at the VMAs. Makeup artist Alexx Mayo was responsible for this glam makeup and matte lip. He painted her lips with Charlotte Tilbury\\'s Rock N Kohl liner in Bedroom Black and Eye Colour Magic Liner Duo in Super Blue to create the deep navy blue hue.Hairstylist Shelby Swain, who often works with the pop star, gave Lizzo\\'s wig the wet look using Matrix\\'s Instacure Anti-Breakage Porosity Spray and Vavooom Extra Full Freezing Spray. For the simple baby hairs, Swain used Matrix\\'s Overachiever Paste 3-in-1 Cream to keep the swoops in place.It was hard to see her nails beneath her mesh gloves, but the almond-shaped claws were painted with silver nail polish by nail artist Eri Ishizu. She used OPI\\'s GelColor in Clean State as a base before adding Chrome Effects in Mixed Metals to create an iridescent finish.

The Emily in Paris star may be called \"classic\" or \"glamorous,\" but the actor rarely ventures into the unconventional. And you could argue the same thing about luxury brand Cartier. But apparently, when the two get together, the trendy, off-beat coolness comes out — a Collins\\'s hair is proof.In the new ad campaign for Clash de Cartier, a jewelry collection that strikes a balance between classic and eccentric, Collins does exactly that. We see her in an elegant, asymmetrical black dress and red lipstick, and her brown hair is pulled back into a sleek, low bun, not unlike the style she wore for her wedding — basically exactly how we picture Lily Collins when we picture Lilly Collins.As Billy Idol\\'s \"Dancing With Myself\" plays, she stands in contrast with another version of herself that looks completely out of her beauty comfort zone, yet it somehow works so well.

Her 29th birthday look has all the elements that define her signature style: inches and inches of hair, super long acrylic nails, and lots of bling.She posted a few photos of the gorgeous birthday look to Instagram on July 4, showing off her mile-long curls nearly as white as snow, pastel purple eye makeup, and baby blue nail design full of iridescent gems. She is seen in a cutout purple dress with her platinum blonde curls cascading over one of her shoulders, the ends almost grazing her knees. Though she tends to switch up her hair color often, she\\'s indulged in her blonde era many times before with this bright hue, just like when she chopped off her hair into a platinum-blonde buzz cut right at the end of 2021.The light hair color pairs beautifully with her lavender cut crease, which also complements her gown perfectly. You\\'d think the light purple shade would also make an appearance on her nails, but not at all. Instead, this stiletto manicure was painted a light blue hue, which feels like an apt choice for the water sign. Each icy blue nail was filled with opalescent jewels of various sizes running straight down the middle.

When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection.

It\\'s easy to see that they\\'ve been collaborating with their favorite nail artists to perfect the finishing touches of their red-carpet beauty looks for the big night, which honors amazing achievements in Black entertainment — music, acting, sports, and more.

Here are our favorite manicures of the night.Billy PorterGetty ImagesLiterally everything about Billy Porter\\'s look is show-stopping, including his manicure.

But, what if I told you there\\'s another radiance-intensifying ingredient that\\'s also a staple in your jewelry box? That\\'s right, I\\'m talking about gold, which is one of the many luminosity-amplifying ingredients in 111Skin\\'s Rose Gold Radiance Booster.111Skin is no stranger to luxury beauty: the brand has started gaining some serious hype from celebs like Kesha and it\\'s become a repeat feature in the Allure Beauty Box for its impressive, skin-nourishing formulations. Even our very own associate features director Dianna Mazzone is a fan of the brand, particularly 111Skin\\'s Vitamin C Brightening Booster. So, I already knew I was in good hands when this fancy-schmancy rose gold bottle first landed on my desk.Courtesy of brandImmediately, I did a quick scan of the label to see if my sensitive, rosacea-stricken skin could handle the formula. The serum contains a few ingredients that are already in my skin-care regimen: hydrating hyaluronic acid, brightening niacinamide, and soothing rosewater. \"The best known effect of rosewater is being anti-inflammatory, which can reduce redness and swelling in the skin,\" Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist James Wang, MD, says of the latter ingredient. \"The hydrating and antibacterial benefits, combined with its ability to calm the skin, can be especially helpful in some patients with inflammatory acne and rosacea.\"But what made me raise my eyebrows in skepticism was the pure gold extract. This may seem like a gimmicky ingredient, but Dr. Wang says that this precious metal can actually have a purpose in your skin-care routine. He notes that gold actually is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and claims of targeting fine lines and wrinkles. \"Although not a fully proven effect, gold is thought to help with wrinkles and signs of sun damage by also boosting collagen production,\" he says. With all of this in mind, Dr. Wang says this ingredient can be irritating to sensitive skin or those allergic to gold, so always patch test this product before applying it to your face.According to the bottle\\'s directions, there are two ways you can use this product: alone after cleansing or mixed into your favorite moisturizer. Whichever path you choose, the brand recommends using one to two drops. I decided to try both avenues of application simply out of curiosity and I\\'ve found that its slippery formula absorbs equally as well, regardless of how you apply it.As for its texture, the Rose Gold Radiance Booster is shimmery and has a slippery feel to it, almost like a champagne-hued version of a snail mucin serum. Once I applied it to my skin, the first thing I noticed was how teensy the gold particles were, which didn\\'t irritate my skin at all. It left a reflective veil of natural-looking shimmer without looking too intense or dramatic, and because of this, I\\'ve been reserving this sparkly serum for my morning skin-care regimen.Jennifer Hussein for AllureSo, is this gold-infused serum really worth the triple-digit price tag? Considering the fact that I\\'ve been using it daily for two months and have seen a major difference in the radiance of my complexion, my answer is a million times over, absolutely. Sure, there are many brightening skin-care products on the market, but as someone who\\'s tested hundreds of these formulations, 111Skin\\'s iridescent serum provided significant results that I haven\\'t achieved with other picks. And, at the very least, it\\'s literally liquid gold for your face, so why not treat yourself to a little luxury?111Skin Rose Gold Radiance Booster$135Want to try it for yourself? The 111Skin Rose Gold Radiance Booster is available for $135 now at dermstore.com and 111skin.com.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesRead more about our favorite luxury beauty products:I\\'ve Been Through Three Bottles of This $195 SerumTatcha\\'s The Clarifying Clay Mask Is a 5-Minute Ticket to Radiant SkinThe Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000 Is So Good, I Stopped Getting Professional BlowoutsNow, watch actress and Allure September cover star Millie Bobby Brown take on new skills:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'In 2010, when Betina Goldstein was fresh out of college, she began her career working for as a Post Production intern for a little show called Saturday Night Live, in addition to gigs in audience casting for shows such as the Food Network\\'s Beat Bobby Flay and MTV\\'s Teen Mom reunions and Hip Hop Squares.A year later, when working with a production company as a freelance production assistant on a photo shoot, one of her producers asked if she knew how to do nails.Goldstein never would\\'ve guessed that within the next 11 years, she\\'d become an ambassador for Chanel, the nail artist of an endless list of celebrity clientele, such as Zoë Kravitz, Julia Garner, Shawn Mendes,Olivia Rodrigo, and Rosalía, and amass a social following of 384,000 (and counting) Instagram followers.\"I became obsessed with teaching myself techniques to achieve greater detail and texture on this tiny canvas attached to my finger,\" Goldstein tells Allure. \"Nail art not only is my profession, but it has become a way of therapy. Each design I create is a reflection of who I am.\"Short Nail Art InspirationGrowing up in Texas with family from Mexico City, Goldstein has had a wide variety of influences on her nail designs, the biggest of which was museum art. She developed an appreciation of the techniques of Diego Rivera, the Mexican painter who became Frida Kahlo\\'s husband, the color palette combinations of Josef Albers, the German artist who was the first to get solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art and the Met in New York, and the styles of her grandparents\\' house in Mexico City, which was designed by Architect Luis Barragán.\"I believe Barragán\\'s work is a study of the language of the colors of México,\" she says. \"Being surrounded by a wide palette definitely shaped my understanding of the interplay between colors and how colors affect emotions, which has impacted my designs greatly.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.When it comes to creating designs now, Goldstein uses her own style and life as inspiration. Because she uses her hands for work —through manicures and jewelry design (did we mention she owns two brands, Doublemoss Jewelry and Doublemoss Arte?) —she found that short nails are the most functional.How to Shape Short NailsGoldstein explains that shaping has the biggest impact on creating the illusion of longer nails. She\\'s a big fan of the tapered oval and square shapes but recommends avoiding flat square nails because they can make your nails look shorter. In terms of trends, every design can look good on short nails, Goldstein says, citing French tips and negative space nails as examples, but it\\'s the way the design is styled that matters.\"If you do a thick, flat French tip, it makes your short nail look shorter,\" she says, opposed to a daintier, more curved tip. \"Negative space nails work wonders for shorter nails. A clean sheer base helps minimize the attention on the nail and focus on the art.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Celebrities Who Love Short NailsWhen navigating designs with clients, Goldstein\\'s biggest goal is to make sure the nails complement the entire look, especially when doing celebrity nails for red carpet events (her résumé includes several Met Galas, U.S. press for The Batman, and The Academy of Motion Pictures Museum Opening Gala, but no big deal).Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I never want the nail art to take over,\" she says. \"Nail art is not for everyone, and I like to respect that by never pushing it on any of my clients.\"Goldstein also enjoys how collaborative the nail art process can be, naming her method with Gemma Chan, whose nails she did for the Met Gala in 2019 and 2021 and The Eternals premiere in London, as an example.\"I create a design based on what she is wearing and then consult Gemma for any tweaks or changes,\" she says. \"I love that Gemma isn\\'t scared to take risks with nails and respects the art.\"Goldstein is making major strides in bringing short nails back, and we\\'re obsessed with all of her designs. To sum it all up, we\\'d say she\\'s nailing it.

To be real, anything \"boiling over\" on our face is something we\\'d like to avoid.According to the National Eczema Association, 31.6 million people in the U.S. have some form of eczema, making it one of the most common skin conditions. If you\\'re experiencing red, irritated skin on your face (especially your eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, or chin), there\\'s a fairly good chance it\\'s facial eczema. You may already have it elsewhere on your body, or it could be on your face alone. And while there is no study evaluating the prevalence of facial eczema, specifically, New York City-based dermatologist Neil Sadick, MD, says he believes the disorder affects about a third of the population.With facial eczema, you\\'ll have to do a bit of detective work to identify what\\'s causing it. There are a few types — atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis being the two most common forms — and they act a little differently. Some types will resolve in a few weeks with treatment, while other cases are chronic and need constant management. But you\\'re not alone. There are solutions as well as ways to keep it under control.Facial eczema can be itchy, flaky, and frustrating — your face is usually the first thing people see — and with so many types of eczema to parse through, it can be overwhelming. To help, we spoke with several board-certified dermatologists to find out what exactly constitutes facial eczema, what triggers the condition, and most importantly, how to keep symptoms at bay.Meet the experts:Macrene Alexiades, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center of New York in New York City.Hadley King, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Anthony Rossi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Neil Sadick, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Adam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C.Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Read MoreBody & Mind GuideSymptoms, treatment options, and personal experiences for various physical, mental, and health conditions and concerns.ArrowIn this story:What Is Facial Eczema?Causes of Facial EczemaHow to Prevent Facial EczemaHow to Treat Facial EczemaShould I Treat Facial Eczema Differently Than I Would Eczema on My Body?What Should I Do if Over-The-Counter Products Aren\\'t Cutting It?What Is Facial Eczema?\"Eczema is an inflammation of the skin caused by either an allergen or irritant,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Anthony Rossi, MD. It can also be genetic, and triggered by irritants.Facial eczema has many different symptoms that can manifest themselves differently from person to person, but some common things to look for are red patches, itchy skin, stinging, and dryness. With darker skin tones, it also tends to be scaly, says Dr. Rossi.Eczema is a common condition that can appear anywhere on the body, but if you\\'re grappling with facial eczema, it\\'s likely on the eyelids, eyebrows, cheeks, or chin. And while it is common, you definitely should bring it to your dermatologist. \"Eczema that develops near the eyes needs special attention because the eyes themselves can be affected,\" adds Dr. Alexiades. \"Those with eczema around the eyes are more susceptible to certain eye problems such as conjunctivitis, inflamed cornea, and changes in the shape of the cornea, a condition called keratoconus.\"Causes of Facial EczemaThere are a few different types of facial eczema — which will be key in not just identifying what you\\'re dealing with, but how you treat it. The most common type of facial eczema is atopic dermatitis. \"Atopic dermatitis is genetic and flares can be triggered by dry environmental conditions, not moisturizing, stress, and allergies,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Hadley King, MD.The second type is contact dermatitis, which comes from exposure to an irritating substance or something you may be allergic to (common perpetrators are cosmetics, dyes, soaps, detergents, fragrance, or smoke — in addition to environmental allergens like pet dander or pollen). \"Some people break out in an eczema rash after eating certain foods, such as nuts, shellfish, milk, and eggs,\" says Dr. Alexiades.Try to note when you see an eczema flare and note any common denominators to your dermatologist. This should help both you and your dermatologist narrow it down and get to the root cause.How to Prevent Facial EczemaThe best way to prevent eczema on the face is the most obvious but perhaps the most important method: identify the trigger and remove it. \"For example, if you notice red patches when you wear jewelry, you may be allergic to nickel. Stop wearing jewelry and your eczema may go away,\" says Dr. Alexiades. \"If you notice red itchy patches after a night out, it may be perfume that is your trigger, in which case stop wearing fragrances and look for fragrance-free cosmetics.\"The same goes for cosmetics and skincare. \"Know what’s in your skincare and if you’re prone to allergies,\" says Dr. Rossi. It may be beneficial to go on a \"product diet.\" Pare down your routine to one gentle product (a cleanser is a good place to start) and add them back in slowly, one by one, to see if you can identify which product is causing your facial eczema. Patch testing—applying a small amount of a product to the sensitive skin on the inside of the arm to see if there is a reaction within 24 hours—can also help to narrow things down.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf you find that your flare-ups happen when you\\'re stressed, you may need to identify some lifestyle changes like taking on fewer projects, getting more rest, or finding more time for mindfulness. Likewise, if you notice that your facial eczema gets worse in dry or hot weather, try to plan ahead for AC breaks, come prepared with sunscreen, and find a thicker and more reliable moisturizer that can hang on all day.How to Treat Facial EczemaSometimes, simply removing your facial eczema triggers will totally cure your skin within weeks. But if your facial eczema is very severe and you can\\'t identify any bad actors, you may want to try over-the-counter hydrocortisone or get a topical steroid prescription from your dermatologist. \"A topical corticosteroid cream will help treat any of the causes of facial eczema,\" says Dr. King. “Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects.” They can be used as needed to treat flares but not for ongoing maintenance, according to the National Eczema Association, since prolonged use can cause withdrawal side effects like red, irritated skin and pimple-like papules.Dr. Rossi adds that antihistamines can be an effective short-term solution if the eczema is caused by an allergen. Otherwise, \"there are more systemic medications for severe or widespread cases,\" he says.How to Curb Flare-upsNot all types of eczema have a surefire \"cure,\" but you can definitely make it more manageable and lessen your flare-ups. You may be able to curb irritation with good lifestyle habits, over-the-counter products, and consistent skincare with gentle but moisturizing products.\"Good, gentle care of your skin is the most important aspect of treating facial eczema,\" says Dr. Alexiades, who recommends fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products if you find that you’re prone to flare-ups. \"Consider a mild cleanser and wash your face with lukewarm water, since heat can cause a flare-up.\"Dr. Alexiades also touts the benefits of keeping your skin hydrated. She recommends moisturizers with emollient ingredients like ceramides and cosmetics that also have moisturizing ingredients. \"Having facial eczema doesn’t mean you can never wear makeup, but not all products are the same,\" she says. \"Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and shea butter.\" Moisturizers and cosmetics with moisturizing ingredients (like hyaluronic acid and shea butter) can help to protect the outer skin barrier—which can be damaged or compromised by eczema, according to the National Eczema Association.Should I treat facial eczema differently than I would eczema on my body?Yes. Both Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, and Dr. Sadick recommend using milder products on your face because the skin is thinner and more sensitive than the skin on your body. \"I would use eczema skin-care products designed for face and body respectively as they contain different concentrations of active ingredients,\" says Dr. Sadick.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesAdam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., recommends using weaker topical steroids, as he says, \"facial skin is more sensitive to the skin thinning and lightening effect of topical steroids.\" According to a study by the National Eczema Association, prolonged use of strong topical steroids can cause a host of withdrawal symptoms once you stop using the cream—like burning, stinging, papules, or pimple-like bumps. However, short-term use is safe and effective with the guidance of a dermatologist.What should I do if over-the-counter products aren\\'t cutting it?Sadly, sometimes eczema on the face can prove extremely stubborn to the point where treatment may need to be prescribed by a doctor. \"If home treatments are not helping, you may need prescription medications,\" says Dr. Shah. \"I usually prescribe either a topical steroid or a topical calcineurin inhibitor, a non-steroidal medication that can reduce inflammation and treat eczema.\"Dr. Shah says she sometimes prescribes special moisturizers called barrier repair creams for patients. And if the eczema is severe and not responding to topical treatments, other options include phototherapy, aka light therapy. There\\'s a wide range of treatment options for facial eczema, so it often comes down to trial and error in order to figure out what works for you. We\\'d recommend always consulting your dermatologist before trying anything new.Read more about caring for skin conditions:6 Skin-Care Ingredients to Add to Your Routine If You Have EczemaHow to Treat Scalp Eczema, According to DermatologistsWhy Colloidal Oatmeal Should Be Part of Your Skin-Care RegimenYou can follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on all things beauty.', \"As the Twitter joke goes, the Met Gala is the one night of the year where we all get to judge celebrities' looks while we lounge around in stained sweatpants.

Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers. It was shiny gold and covered in ruby and pearl-looking appliqués. She also sported a gold, armor-esque covering on her other pointer finger. The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore. Somehow, it was both a retro and futuristic look all at once. And one that set the hearts of internet critics aflame.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.King kept the rest of her beauty look simple, with cropped hair and minimal-looking makeup.

If that wasn\\'t enough, the \"Kiss Me More\" singer made our jaws drop with the stunning Schiaparelli black gown and gold accessories she wore for the awards show. By now we expect the pop star to capture our attention with every new look, but we didn\\'t expect her to show up to the event with short nails or intricate gold rings that look like they\\'re worth more than my student loans.The \"Say So\" singer didn\\'t hesitate to take risks for this look, something we love from her. Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas gave her a neutral smokey eye with a hint of bright yellow on the inner crease and waterline that complemented the daring gown very well. As for her hair, hairstylist Jared Henderson (known as JStay Ready to many) slicked her dark hair into a high ponytail with a flipped end that we have a good feeling was fun to whip around.Getty ImagesTypically Doja Cat wears lengthy nails, but for this look, she kept them short. Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe. But this manicure is anything but simple, because this opulent jewelry is basically nail art.Her middle finger had the largest ring, which covered her entire finger and nail. The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one! What else can we pierce?Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"And then it literally never healed. The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me. I\\'m going to keep it forever.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookI Got a Tragus Piercing — Here\\'s What You Should Know Before Getting OneNow, see 100 years of piercings in less than three minutes:', 'To me, tragus piercings always stood for college rebellion. One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade. As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces.

More than a few modeling paychecks later (thank you, Kim\\'s Skims, Rihanna\\'s Savage x Fenty, Victoria\\'s, well, Victoria\\'s Secret), the 23-year-old did just that.

As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says. More than a few modeling paychecks later (thank you, Kim\\'s Skims, Rihanna\\'s Savage x Fenty, Victoria\\'s, well, Victoria\\'s Secret), the 23-year-old did just that. Helen Harris crafted her a set of open windows in gold for the bottom and dueling statement gems on top. They bring daily joy to van Doorn\\'s innermost preteen: \"My grills make little Solange happy.\"Alicia DraytonTo create a similar makeup look: Powerchrome Loose Eye Pigment in Castaway and High-Pigment Longwear Eyeliner in Ocean Drive by Nars.\\nMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesDrayton has an array of winking stones affixed to her front teeth.

Yep, it\\'s equally as disappointing when you find an eye-catching set of earrings only to find it\\'s made of materials that could irritate your skin. Sure, they say pain is beauty, but when that pain involves itchiness, redness, and uncomfortable rashes (on an already-thin and sensitive part of your skin, no less), it begs the question: \"were these hoops really worth it?\" The short answer is, well, no.And remember: you\\'ll know if your piercing is infected if it\\'s red, inflamed, sore, hot to touch, or if it\\'s releasing puss. You should consult with your physician if you suspect you have an infection.The truth is, if you\\'re someone who struggles with finding earrings that won\\'t cause discomfort, you may have to work a little harder to find your match. \"Unfortunately, sterling silver jewelry is made with a mix of metals, often nickel, which is the most significant irritant to sensitive ears,\" explains Ottawa-based medical director of Concept Medical Samuel Hetz, MD. \"Those with sensitive ears want to find hypoallergenic rhodium-plated jewelry with low to no nickel content.\" He recommends looking for the standard benchmarks of 14k gold or above as well as sterling silver 925 grade to reduce the chances of nickel content.Because we don\\'t believe those with sensitive skin should be left out of the party, we rounded up nine of the best earrings for sensitive ears that are always stylish, and never irritating.BaubleBar Sutara 18K Gold Earrings$48 at BaubleBar$42 at NordstromFor sensitive-skinned folks, Baublebar\\'s Sutara Earrings will make you thank your lucky stars they\\'re made out of 18k gold.

All around me were people filling in or touching up their ink, but I continued onward past the buzzing needles — straight to the back, where the piercer works. After a tough year, I was ready for a bit of body modification to memorialize the challenges and symbolize the jump forward into 2022. What I didn\\'t realize, as I asked for a third lobe piercing to continue to build my stack of hoops, is that my bright idea was of a pace with a wide new piercing trend.More and more customers are asking for what Alaina Rothstein, cofounder of Los Angeles ear piercing service Leo West, refers to as a \"milestone piercing.\" Rothstein has seen mothers and daughters come in for birthday piercing; she knows of a woman who miscarried and got a stud to remind her of the loss. \"It\\'s a fun, really beautiful way to carry something special with you in happy times and in sad times,\" she says. \"And I think it\\'s like super cool that it\\'s translated [from the tattoo world] into the piercing world.\"Our piercers have seen birthdays, bachelorette parties, and groups of friends come in to celebrate together. But what trends are they trying, specifically? In other words, which parts of the ear are getting the most adoration through adornment right now?Meet the experts:Alaina Rothstein and Jill Katz, RN, cofounders of Los Angeles ear-piercing service Leo WestLisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a piercing studio with locations in New York, Texas, and California (among others)Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer at Live by the Sword Tattoo in Brooklyn, New YorkIn This Story:Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?How to Pick Your PiercerConstellation PiercingsStacked LobesVertical StacksForward HelixSnakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)ConchOuter Conch, a.k.a. SconchJump ahead, or read on for everything you need to know about the freshest ear-piercing trends, as well as the estimated length of time the healing process may take.Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?Milestones are one reason customers are flocking to their local licensed piercer, but another is a generalized sense of freedom and autonomy that\\'s arrived as a result of the pandemic. \"With remote work and workplace norms overall changing, more people are feeling free to experiment with bolder looks and express their personality,\" says Lisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a national piercing studio. That experimentation shows up both in the amount of piercings and in the piercings themselves, which are getting \"more creative,\" Bubbers says. (Plus, as Rothstein points out, \"one fun thing about mask-wearing is that your ears show.\")The last \"really important trend,\" as Leo West cofounder Jill Katz, RN describes it, is \"adorning what you got.\" There\\'s no normal, she says. A gorgeous earscape is all about working with your budget and your anatomy to create an embodiment of your style in tiny, beautiful silver, gold, or gem form.The result: forward helices, vertically stacked lobes, conches, sconches, snake bites, and plenty of other piercing types we never knew existed, spanning from the outer rims of the ear to the inner cartilage and back to the earlobe. Our trend-spotting piercers shared the adornments they\\'ve seen grow more popular over 2022, and what they envision for the years (and ears!) to come.How to Pick Your PiercerJust as with microblading, filler, or any other body modification, it\\'s important to find a professional piercer that you trust, with a style that appeals to you. This is an essential step, whether you’re a longtime body modification fan or it’s your first piercing ever.As Brooks notes, the benefit of following a piercer on social media is that you can seek them out and, as in one service she offers, put your ear(s) in her hands. During a \"curation\" appointment, the expert will look at your ear as a whole and help design multiple piercings to fit your style and your desires.At Leo West, that might look like getting multiple differentiated piercings on each ear. \"Symmetry is out,\" says Rothstein. As she points out, a specialist is extra helpful if you\\'re nervous about curating an asymmetrical look. \"It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t want ears that match, but it has to have a rhyme or reason to it,\" she says. \"I have two ears, and I like to say ‘one’s a little bit classy, one\\'s a little bit sassy.\\'\"Constellation PiercingsInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhile some of this year\\'s trends include holes in unexpected places, more of them involve third, fourth, or fifth additions to an already-pierced ear. At Leo West, the result is what they\\'ve named a \"constellation.\" A constellation consists of \"really small pieces, close together, closer than what your traditional spacing would be,\" explains Rothstein. The result is an \"intentionally random\" grouping of ear piercings that show off studs and gems.Stacked LobesInstagram user @leowestco\"People often come in [to the studio] and say \\'I’m not cool enough,\\'\" for a trendy piercing, recounts Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer in Brooklyn. If you\\'re intimidated by the thought of a conch piercing or even a constellation, Brooks thinks that an ear stack is an easier entry point. These piercings are less painful than their cartilage-filled brethren, and can make their way up the lobe either evenly spaced or placed close together.Vertical StacksInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"If I\\'m being honest, I love to put my hair behind my ear to show the little pops of pieces sitting right above your classic [piercing],\" laughs Rothstein. She\\'s referring to a vertical stack, which entails a piercing centered directly above your traditional first or second hole. It\\'s usually filled with a small stone or a small star, Rothstein\\'s favorite. This piercing does require a certain amount of space on the lobe, but if you have enough canvas to play with, it \"gives the ear a little extra uniqueness.\"Forward Helixcourtesy of StudsThe official name for that bouncy piece of cartilage where your ear meets your skull is the \"forward helix.\" According to Bubbers, customers are coming in requesting one or even multiple piercings on the forward helix. \"We do see new and different piercing trends emerge each year based on what’s trending in fashion, culture, and celebrity,\" she says. Celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Chantal Jeffries have helped popularize the new (and finicky — helix piercings can take up to nine months to heal) style.Snakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)In the realm of body piercing, the term \"snakebite\" typically refers to two piercings on either side of your lower lip, oftentimes barbells or studs.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen it comes to ears, however, it entails two holes placed close together, slightly separated from the rest of your ear piercings, giving the impression of that your piercer just might have used two fangs to get the job done. According to Bubbers, most customers opt for a snakebite in their “midi,\" the center point of the outer ear.ConchInstagram user @leowestcoWe\\'ve named conch piercings as of-trend for the past few years, but the cartilage piercing is still popular enough to remain on the list. It pierces through the inner-ear cartilage that makes up the back of the year. At Studs, Bubbers says customers are opting more and more for a snakebite on the conch for a doubly trendy effect.Outer Conch (Sometimes Known as a \"Sconch\")courtesy of Studs\"I hope you don\\'t use this name,\" laughs Brooks. She prefers the more medical-sounding \"outer conch,\" but the phrase \"sconch\" is catching on to describe a piercing placed at the lining ridge in the cavern space close to the center of the ear.\"It\\'s right in your eye-line when people look at you,\" she says, so it provides a way to show a bit of personality even when you\\'re on Zoom or wearing a mask. Because it\\'ll be eye-catching no matter what kind of earring(s) you have in, Brooks likes adorning an outer conch piercing with a piece of jewelry that makes a big statement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesMore on the world of piercings:How Tongue Piercings Work, From Pain Level and Placement to Aftercare and Healing TimeHow to Remove Every Type of Piercing at Home8 Types of Ear Piercings, ExplainedContraconch Ear Piercings Are Gaining Popularity for Its Unexpected PlacementIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?

That way, I have a scent memory anchored to that destination or time period for whenever I choose to relive it. My last international trip, to a prestigious wellness resort in Austria for some on-the-ground reporting, demanded a very specific choice: something compact enough to fit in my carry-on without getting tossed by TSA, calming enough to match the vibe of the Alpine oasis, and extra long-lasting so it would last through hikes, meals, and medical treatments without reapplication. Lastly, it would need to smell expensive, because my fellow wellness-seekers would expect as much — but we\\'ll get to that later.After much deliberation, I landed on a luxe new formula that had just hit my desk before my flight: the Jennifer Fisher My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil.My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil$65I was initially surprised that Jennifer Fisher, a jewelry designer beloved by her red carpet clientele and the master behind some of Jennifer Lopez\\'s favorite hoop earrings, had ventured into perfumery. That said, fragrance does feel like a sparkling accessory that amps up any outfit or beauty look, and Fisher wanted her new perfume oil to make a statement for the wearer. \"I want anyone wearing My Scent to feel confident and sexy,\" she tells Allure. “And to smell like a fresh baked cookie.\" Upon first wear, I didn\\'t flag baked goods as a top note, but I did instantly fall for the vanilla and coconut Fisher knew she wanted to include in the formula.\"The blend of vanilla and coconut brings back memories from my childhood growing up in Santa Barbara, California,\" she says. \"For years, I was combining different vanilla and coconut fragrances to try and create my own personal scent. Finding a scent that was a combination of surf wax from the beaches in my hometown, Montecito, and a fresh baked cookie is what I\\'ve always wanted.\"Australian sandalwood, pear, and Tonka bean flank the creamy hero notes, and it all comes together to smell equal parts sunny and cozy, like throwing on a cashmere sweater on a breezy summer night. Toting it around is just as effortless too: I carried the teeny-tiny rollerball in my airplane carry-on, my spa robe to and from massages and lunch, and even in my fanny pack while Nordic walking in the mountains.No, really, I took this tube everywhere with me.\\nTaylore Glynn\"I wanted to come out with something small, compact, and portable you could throw in your bag and take everywhere with you,\" says Fisher. \"A spray to me didn\\'t feel as transportable, but that doesn\\'t mean I am ruling it out for the next product. This oil was designed intentionally to be worn and carried on-the-go.\" In addition to being totable, the formula also fulfilled my need for something that would last through spa treatments and saunas.\"Coconut is a good oil carrier to round out scents,\" says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, noting that scent can last longer in oil form because it\\'s not watered down. \"Atomized scents usually contain alcohol to help spraying. Fragrance oil is the most concentrated form [you can find].\"The scent was so powerful that even my fellow resort guests noticed. In fact, I was flagged down multiple times in the dining room and in the halls to reveal what I was wearing because it smelled \"beautiful\" and \"divine.\" For important context, some of the resort guests on the premises at the time — who I can\\'t explicitly identify — included one of the most famous supermodels of our generation, an Oscar-winning actress, and an entirely different famous jewelry designer with whom I chatted about ketamine therapy. I realized that My Scent smelled flat-out expensive, which seems to be a selling point amongst perfume enthusiasts on social media. In fact, there\\'s a whole genre of #FragranceTok posts dedicated to perfumes that make you smell, well, rich.

Well, we say it's time to take a moment to appreciate such bold choices, such as Doja Cat's quirky makeup looks from Paris Fashion week — she still has us wondering how her shirt remained white with all that gold. And we certainly can't leave out the Hadid sisters' bleached brows for their own prance down the very same runways. It's not much of a shocker, then, that Gigi Hadid went for something a bit odd and definitely bold for a recent red-carpet beauty moment. For the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards on November 7, Hadid graced the carpet with an unconventional cool gray lipstick.I'll be the first to admit that I did a double-take at first glimpse. No, it's not your typical choice where a lipstick shade is concerned, but makeup artists Patrick Ta and Akina Shimizu were able to pull off this muted-yet-fresh-faced makeup look on Hadid. Catch me zooming in on those lips that are seemingly matte and glossy at the same time. We're definitely not the only ones hoping the details will soon be dropped on what particular beauty brand this lipstick is made by. Nonetheless, this all-American color pallet is insanely cohesive.Let's also not forget the striking blonde hair color and the sleek, slicked-back bun hair stylist Laura Polko put together to bring out the jewelry on Hadid's ears and nose. My favorite part is the septum ring paired with the tartan-patterned Thom Browne attire styled by Mimi Cuttrell — it's full-on grunge. I'm honestly tempted to break out my alternative pop-rock playlist, like, now. Getty ImagesAdmittedly, not all of us are going to bombard the makeup aisles looking for any smoky or stormy gray lipstick shades. However, we can appreciate what works and encourage those inspired to travel the road less traveled.

Being an icon is what you do with that platform.” She not only spoke the words of a true advocate, but she also wore a statement red manicure that symbolized her mantra.All of what she said is true, and what better way to amplify that message than with a fiery manicure adorned in colors that feel empowering? The singer\\'s trusted nail artist, Eri Ishizu, looked to OPI\\'s bright red GelColor in Big Apple Red and added some edge to the manicure with the OPI GelColor in Lincoln Park After Dark. Both polishes were infused into the French accent that coated the tips of her stiletto-shaped nails.In a press release shared with Allure, Ishizu furthered the singer\\'s sentiment. \"Tonight, Lizzo was being honored for such a special award as the People\\'s Champion, and the nail look had to live up to just that.

The supermodel went for a runway-ready vibe for both of her costumes this year, though they were extremely different in tone.For her first look, Bieber covered herself in roses to pay homage to an Yves Saint Laurent haute couture runway look from 1999, originally worn by model Laetitia Casta. In her carousel of pics, Bieber wears a top and miniskirt made of huge pink roses, enhanced by a matching pink organza ruffled train at her hips. Roses also pop up on one ankle and serve as a flower crown atop her head. The look is very The Birth of Venus but make it fashion —and floral.Bieber let the roses be the centerpiece of her costume and kept her hair and makeup subtle and natural with radiant \"glazed\" skin, deep rose lips, and a hint of shimmery pink eye shadow, then finished off the costume with a pale pink and white manicure. She wore no jewelry or accessories other than her engagement diamond and a pair of pale pink ankle-strap sandals. While Casta wore the rose look with Raphaelite ringlet curls, Bieber decided on loose brunette waves for a more modern approach. I just have one question, Hailey: Are those real roses? Hopefully, you de-thorned them if so!Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Later on during Halloweekend, Bieber ditched the angelic florals of her first costume in favor of something darker: a \"Versace Vampire.\" The model donned a strappy black bustier top and high-waisted black skirt with a black and gold Versace logo belt, opera-length shiny black latex gloves, and a pair of vampire fangs for the Goth-inspired vampire moment. A black wig, bright purple eyeshadow, flushed cheeks, and blood-red lips (obviously), plus chunky gold necklaces and huge gold and pearl earrings added to the glamourous \\'90s Versace vibe; she could have walked right off a Gianni Versace runway, minus the fangs.Instagram/Hailey BieberThe two looks may have been complete opposites, but they paid homage to Bieber\\'s fashion roots in the most gorgeously spooky and stunning way.More celeb Halloween looks you may have missed:The Kardashian\\'s Halloween Costumes Included Mystique, Bride of Frankenstein and Jessie from Toy StoryYou Have to See Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly as Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee for HalloweenMegan Thee Stallion Has Outdone Herself in the Halloween Nail Art DepartmentMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNow, learn Hailey\\'s 10 biggest beauty tips:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'TikTok-turned-reality star Dixie D\\'Amelio finally committed to the hairstyle she\\'s been longing for since sixth grade.

You can find plenty of examples across social media. Just look to hashtags #tonguepiercing and #tonguepiercings on TikTok and Instagram, which have over 790 million views and 520,000 posts, respectively.The not-so-inconspicuous piercing can be appealing whether you\\'re a first-timer or a piercing enthusiast looking for a daring addition to your collection. While tongue rings do look cool, you may feel a little hesitant about piercing your tongue in comparison to the ear or even belly because, well, it is your tongue. The stakes seem higher and more dangerous should an infection occur.But despite the location, the aftercare for tongue piercings is actually a lot easier (and a lot less painful) than some would expect. Here\\'s everything you need to know before scheduling your piercing appointment, whether you\\'re undecided about taking the plunge or ready to get your tongue pierced tomorrow.Meet the experts:Jenna Myers, a piercer at Live By the Sword Tattoo in New York CityErich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone HealthLynn Loheide, a body piercer based in Nashville, TennesseeAre tongue piercings dangerous?Before you even think about setting up your appointment, it\\'s important to understand the risks associated with tongue piercings. Like any piercing, there\\'s always a possibility of infection or rejection.Sometimes the signs of infection can be easy to confuse with irritation in piercings, especially if you\\'re extra paranoid. But New York City-based piercer Jenna Myers says that there tends to be a pretty big distinction between the two.\"[With an] infection, your tongue is going to look absolutely wild,\" Myers shares. \"It\\'ll be two to three times the size, turning almost green or white, [with puss].\" When that happens, she always advises going to the ER for professional help. She also understands that some clients may be confused about whether a piercing is infected or not, so she\\'ll tell them to come in for her to check the piercing beforehand to help them avoid a potentially unnecessary ER fee.Erich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone Health, notes that pus, severe tongue swelling, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and difficult breathing indicate that it\\'s time to seek out a medical professional. Typically, infected piercings are usually treated with antibiotics and the removal of jewelry, he explains.But there are some rare cases where surgery might be needed to drain an abscess or deal with any other complications, according to Dr. Voigt. For example, he once had to perform an emergency surgery on a patient because their tongue started to fill with blood and swell, leading them to choke. \"Fortunately, I was able to take the person to the operating room, remove the piercing (which was difficult because half of it became incorporated into the swollen tongue), incise the tongue, tie off a bleeding artery and well as cauterize the muscles, and then suture the tongue back together,\" Dr. Voigt shares.Luckily, not every tongue piercing will become infected. Still, it\\'s important to note that regardless of placement, the piercing can cause damage to the teeth and gums, according to piercer Lynn Loheide and Dr. Voigt. \"You need to understand that going into it, be okay with that risk, and also know what you have to do to minimize that risk,\" Loheide shares.Are horizontal \"snake eyes\" tongue piercings safe?Speaking of placement, there are restrictions as to where the tongue piercing can go. You might have heard of snake eyes before. For those who are unfamiliar, this style typically refers to a horizontal tongue piercing at the tip of the tongue. And if you had hopes of getting that piercing, keep dreaming. Unfortunately, experts say that tongue piercings should only go vertically through the tongue because horizontal placement comes with a big risk of damage to the teeth and gum recession.\"When we\\'re piercing vertically, especially in the center, we\\'re piercing through a connective tissue between those muscles,\" Loheide explains. \"But when you\\'re piercing horizontally, you\\'re actually pinning those muscles together, and that can cause a lot of damage.\" They also note that in the state of Oregon, horizontal tongue piercings are banned for this reason.Can anyone get a tongue piercing?Though everyone\\'s tongue is different, Loheide says if your tongue is too short or you have a tongue-tie — which is basically when the webbing underneath your tongue comes almost or all the way to the tip — a tongue piercing is probably not the best option for you.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen you arrive at your appointment, don\\'t be surprised if the piercer starts analyzing your mouth. In fact, that\\'s a good sign because your unique anatomy will dictate where you can and can\\'t get pierced, and any reputable piercer will ensure to take that into account, Loheide shares.\"We want to see where the blood flow is along the underside of the tongue and make sure that we\\'re not too close to it,\" they explain. \"But we also want to look at the shape of someone\\'s teeth and someone\\'s mouth when we\\'re deciding placement.\" That way, a piercer can ensure that they aren\\'t causing unnecessary damage and that the jewelry won\\'t rub up uncomfortably against your teeth.What can I expect during a tongue piercing appointment?Before your appointment, it\\'s imperative that you brush your teeth and tongue before arriving. Myers shares that typically her clients are given mouthwash right before to help clean their mouths out.As mentioned above, most of your appointment will be spent on prepping and checking your tongue before the needle is inserted. The actual piercing part of the session is short, just like most other piercings — a hollow needle is pushed through the tongue, and then the piercer adds the jewelry, which is a barbell shape.For standard tongue piercings, the ring is usually in the center of the tongue. Though horizontal piercings are a big no-no, you can still get two vertical tongue piercings. Some may call them venom piercings, but Loheide prefers to just refer to them as paired tongue piercings because for some people venom refers to two horizontal piercings, and the slang terms used change over time.\"Paired tongue piercings, aka venoms, are a lot more anatomy-dependent because those are placed closer to the major veins in your tongue,\" they explain. \"So we have to make sure that there\\'s space around that blood flow for them to be placed safely.\"Like any piercing, you should expect pain, and though it\\'s subjective, Loheide and Myers both swear that a tongue piercing is not as bad as you might think. \"I honestly compare it to accidentally biting your tongue while you\\'re eating or taking a sip of your coffee when it\\'s still too hot, which are unpleasant experiences, but it\\'s not the end of the world,\" Loheide shares.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn fact, they say that the most uncomfortable part is having the piercer\\'s hands in your mouth for an extended amount of time. Myers notes that on a scale of one to 10, most of her clients rate standard tongue piercings between a one to three, and paired tongue piercings a three to five.What does aftercare for a tongue piercing look like?There are a few things to expect immediately after your piercing. If you\\'ve been pierced before, some of these won\\'t be too shocking, but there are certain effects that are specific to tongue piercings.Right after your appointment, expect your tongue to be a bit swollen and painful for about one to two weeks, according to Loheide. That\\'s naturally going to happen because the piercing is a fresh wound. In addition to the pain and swelling, you\\'ll also deal with a slight lisp or change in how you speak. \"After about a week, the swelling will go down, and then the rest of the healing process is pretty easy,\" they share.Myers estimates that for a single tongue piercing, it will take about one to three months and three to five for paired piercings. \"Because the tongue is so vascular, it has a lot of blood flow to it, so it heals really quickly,\" she says. On the other hand, Loheide says to expect it to take about three to five months to be fully healed.Thankfully, the aftercare for tongue piercings isn\\'t too complicated. In general, maintaining good oral hygiene — brushing your teeth regularly and flossing — is important. Once you get home, Loheide recommends immediately changing out your toothbrush for a new one and using milder oral hygiene products. They advise avoiding toothpaste with whitening ingredients.Both piercers strongly suggest using an alcohol-free mouthwash that won\\'t burn your mouth. Loheide likes Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse because it doesn\\'t taste as badly as some alcohol-free mouthwashes do, it\\'s affordable, and can be found in most drug stores. Myers also recommends sterile saline solution, which tends to be recommended for most piercings.Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse$10Apart from switching up your oral products, you may have to change what you eat, but only for a short while. Myers suggests avoiding spicy, crunchy, and acidic foods in the first few weeks to avoid irritation. \"Things that you wouldn\\'t [want on] a paper cut, basically, you don\\'t want to eat the first few weeks of a tongue piercing, because it will cause serious discomfort,\" she says.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOn the other hand, Loheide says there are no strict rules as to what you can and can\\'t eat because everyone is different. But you still have to be mindful of how your mouth and tongue feel when you do eat or drink certain things. \"If you go to eat something and you\\'re like, \\'Wow, this feels terrible to eat,\\' don\\'t keep eating it,\" they share.Ultimately, try to not go overboard with your piercing aftercare, because that could potentially case more irritation. \"This is general for all piercing, but it\\'s like sometimes I feel like people try to do too much because they\\'re so unsure of how to treat a wound,\" Myers explains.\" Being as simple as possible with your aftercare is really best. Your body is really good at healing itself.\"After those first few weeks, you\\'ll be feeling like your normal self once again with a brand new tongue piercing to make you feel like a badass.Read more stories about piercings:7 Piercing Trends That Will Be Everywhere in 2022How to Remove Every Kind of Piercing Jewelry at HomeIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?Now enjoy the unboxing of the April 2022 Allure Beauty Box:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'Doja Cat is ready to travel to a galaxy far, far away.

Anthropological records show that dentists as far back as the Mayan Empire decorated teeth with jade, gold, and turquoise, according to Anjali Rajpal, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California, nicknamed \"The Diamond Dentist\" on account of the bejeweled designs she creates for her celebrity clientele.Tooth jewelry also has significance in Black culture — a well-known example is grills, which were first worn by West Indian immigrants in the \\'70s and \\'90s hip-hop artists. Grills are decorative covers made of gold, silver, or encrusted with jewels that snap over one or more teeth and are removed at the end of each day. Tooth gems as we know them today differ from grills, but it\\'s important to recognize the cultures they\\'re derived from.Instead of a mouthful of precious metal, tooth gems are usually a single or a few delicate multi-colored gems or diamonds that are bonded individually to the teeth. Pinterest is clearly here for the trend, with the site reporting an 85 percent uptick in searches for \"tooth gems\" last year alone, while TikTok views for the hashtag #toothgems currently stand at 130.4m. \"Tooth gems add a little edge to someone\\'s style and are a less invasive way to make a statement than a tattoo,\" Dr. Rajpal tells Allure.Aesthetics aside, what about the dental health implications of these tiny adornments? We asked experts to share how tooth gems can be applied, and cared for, safely.Meet the Experts:Anjali Rajpal, DMD, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California.Michael Apa, DDS, an aesthetic dentist in New York City.Brian Kantor, DDS, a cosmetic dentist in New York City.How are tooth gems applied?Everyone\\'s bite is different, so there\\'s no avoiding a consultation first – sorry, dentist\\'s orders. \"[A consultation appointment] is also an opportunity to take my client\\'s style and personality into account when collaborating with them for their jewelry design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.If you\\'re choosing a semi-permanent tooth gem, no drilling is required: The technique is similar to the way braces are applied. \"An acidic solution (or etching gel) is placed on the tooth\\'s surface, microscopically roughening the enamel, before the gemstone is bonded to it with an adhesive and curing lamp,\" explains New York City-based aesthetic dentist Michael Apa. The whole process only takes a matter of minutes and is painless, provided the gem is bonded to the surface of a healthy tooth, Dr. Apa says. \"If you\\'ve got worn-away enamel from grinding your teeth or eating too many acidic foods, there will likely be sensitivity,\" he adds.Permanent tooth gems do require drilling a hole in the desired location, so be ready for the commitment if you\\'re planning on getting this adornment because it won\\'t be easy to remove. Also worth noting: While tooth gems can be bonded to veneers, Dr. Apa says they can\\'t be worn with Invisalign.How much do tooth gems cost?There\\'s no one-size-fits-all price tag. The cost will largely depend on your choice of design and materials (a Swarovski crystal, for example, will be cheaper than a diamond). Some dentists charge two separate fees – one for the gemstone and another for the application. \"My in-office fees include both and can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the size, quality, and quantity of the stones and the nature of the design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.How long do tooth gems last?Most tooth gems are semi-permanent and can last anywhere between six months to one year, says Brian Kantor, a cosmetic dentist in New York City. The right aftercare and dental materials used to bond the gemstone to the tooth will help you get the most out of your new dental jewelry.\"For the first 24 hours after getting a tooth gem, you should only eat soft foods and avoid using an electric toothbrush or drinking soda, coffee, or tea to protect the fresh bond,\" says Dr. Kantor, adding that picking or playing with your tooth gem is also off-limits. Sometimes a tooth gem may fall off on its own if you bite down hard on something, but Dr. Kantor says not to worry: \"There\\'s no harm to your tooth if that happens and the gem can simply be re-attached.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSemi-permanent tooth gems can also be safely removed by a dentist if you change your mind or want to switch up the design. “The gem is simply polished off along with any adhesive on the tooth,\" says Dr. Rajpal. As for permanent tooth gems, though, be warned that removing a permanent tooth gem that was inserted into a tooth will leave a hole. \"This hole will then need to be filled in with a white filling material that is color-matched to the existing shade of the tooth,\" adds Dr. Rajpal.Are tooth gems safe?If you ask Dr. Apa, tooth gems are purely an accessory. \"They\\'re a very specific aesthetic choice because they don\\'t offer the restorative benefits that come with veneers or crowns,\" he says. On top of not offering any benefits, there are a few dental risks that come with getting a set of gems.\"Tooth gems can trap plaque and create places for stray food particles and harmful bacteria to hide,\" Dr. Kantor explains. Needless to say, keeping the gem clean and practicing good oral hygiene is essential if you want to avoid gum inflammation, decay, or other dental issues. Alongside regular flossing, Dr. Apa recommends brushing twice a day with a non-abrasive toothpaste and soft bristle sonic toothbrush \"because the vibration offers a deeper clean and dislodges food stuck to the gemstone,\" he says.The bottom line? In general, as long as a dentist applies your chosen gem, and you\\'re taking proper care of your teeth at home, \"the risks are minimal,\" Dr. Apa says. In the wrong hands, he warns you could end up getting a gem with a rough surface that can cause traumatic lesions on the inside of the lip. \"Or if the gem isn\\'t placed properly, you can break an opposing tooth when you bite down,\" he cautions.So, I shouldn\\'t try applying tooth gems at home?Nope! Advice from dentists hasn\\'t stopped folks from taking the DIY route with nail art gems and superglue, but it should. \"It sounds obvious, but nobody should be ingesting toxic glue,\" insists Dr. Rajpal, who prefers to work with biocompatible materials such as gold and precious or semiprecious stones. \"Besides, glue doesn\\'t properly bond the gem to the tooth structure as well as dental materials,\" she explains. \"It\\'s far safer for a tooth gem to be applied by an experienced dentist, using a non-toxic material and polished to avoid any bacterial traps, as it will last longer, be more comfortable and hygienic.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesFor the same reason, Dr. Apa recommends a dentist remove the gem to avoid accidentally stripping away healthy enamel or tooth structure. \"You shouldn\\'t DIY anything in dentistry,\" he says. \"Tooth gem application is a dental procedure, and all procedures should be performed by a professional.\"More stories to take a bite into:I Took on Credit Card Debt to Get Braces as an AdultDentists Reveal the Correct Order to Brush Your Teeth, Floss, and Use MouthwashHow to Deal With Teeth Grinding and Jaw ClenchingNow, see how dental care has evolved over the last 100 years:', 'The 2022 MTV VMAs have barely even begun, and Lizzo is already stealing the show. The \"About Damn Time\" singer arrived at the awards show in an ensemble that was almost as dark as the black carpet she walked on. She looked like she could be princess of the underworld or even a gothic cake topper with her massive navy blue gown, dark lipstick, and golden rings on her ears, fingers, and lips.Where do you even start with a look like this? The singer\\'s navy blue gown was a gorgeous rumpled, off-the-shoulder dress from Jean Paul Gaultier. She paired it with sheer navy blue gloves that covered her forearms.Her golden jewelry was as excessive as her stunning gown in all the best ways possible. On both of her ring fingers, she wore an abstract looped ring. Earrings of various sizes covered her entire cartilage and lobe. The rings along her cartilage were thicker in width but smaller in circumference, so they hugged her ear. The hoops on the lobe were much larger, nearly skimming her shoulders. The last ring lay in the middle of her bottom lip.Getty ImagesThe lip ring combined with the dark blue lipstick and slicked back, wet-looking hair gave this look an edgier vibe that fit right in at the VMAs. Makeup artist Alexx Mayo was responsible for this glam makeup and matte lip. He painted her lips with Charlotte Tilbury\\'s Rock N Kohl liner in Bedroom Black and Eye Colour Magic Liner Duo in Super Blue to create the deep navy blue hue.Hairstylist Shelby Swain, who often works with the pop star, gave Lizzo\\'s wig the wet look using Matrix\\'s Instacure Anti-Breakage Porosity Spray and Vavooom Extra Full Freezing Spray. For the simple baby hairs, Swain used Matrix\\'s Overachiever Paste 3-in-1 Cream to keep the swoops in place.It was hard to see her nails beneath her mesh gloves, but the almond-shaped claws were painted with silver nail polish by nail artist Eri Ishizu. She used OPI\\'s GelColor in Clean State as a base before adding Chrome Effects in Mixed Metals to create an iridescent finish. Those two products are exclusive to nail artist pros, but OPI\\'s Nail Lacquer in Clean Slate and Infinite Shine in Silver on Ice work as replacements.Getty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf this was just her arrival look, we can\\'t wait for what she\\'s going to be wearing on stage when she performs.

The Emily in Paris star may be called \"classic\" or \"glamorous,\" but the actor rarely ventures into the unconventional. And you could argue the same thing about luxury brand Cartier. But apparently, when the two get together, the trendy, off-beat coolness comes out — a Collins\\'s hair is proof.In the new ad campaign for Clash de Cartier, a jewelry collection that strikes a balance between classic and eccentric, Collins does exactly that. We see her in an elegant, asymmetrical black dress and red lipstick, and her brown hair is pulled back into a sleek, low bun, not unlike the style she wore for her wedding — basically exactly how we picture Lily Collins when we picture Lilly Collins.As Billy Idol\\'s \"Dancing With Myself\" plays, she stands in contrast with another version of herself that looks completely out of her beauty comfort zone, yet it somehow works so well. Her hair is black with of-the-moment micro bangs, and the hairstyle is complemented by bold, black liquid-liner wings and black nail polish. Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.On Tuesday, Collins teased a preview of the look, giving us a peek at the baby bangs, which appear to have been styled by Gregory Russell. The makeup looks were done by Fiona Stiles, and the manicures by nail artist Thuy Nguyen.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Although Collins recently told us that her curtain bangs are a \"dedicated decision\" that she\\'s wanted to do \"for years but never had the courage to take the plunge,\" it looks like she may be open to trying other, unexpected fringe looks.

Her 29th birthday look has all the elements that define her signature style: inches and inches of hair, super long acrylic nails, and lots of bling.She posted a few photos of the gorgeous birthday look to Instagram on July 4, showing off her mile-long curls nearly as white as snow, pastel purple eye makeup, and baby blue nail design full of iridescent gems. She is seen in a cutout purple dress with her platinum blonde curls cascading over one of her shoulders, the ends almost grazing her knees. Though she tends to switch up her hair color often, she\\'s indulged in her blonde era many times before with this bright hue, just like when she chopped off her hair into a platinum-blonde buzz cut right at the end of 2021.The light hair color pairs beautifully with her lavender cut crease, which also complements her gown perfectly. You\\'d think the light purple shade would also make an appearance on her nails, but not at all. Instead, this stiletto manicure was painted a light blue hue, which feels like an apt choice for the water sign. Each icy blue nail was filled with opalescent jewels of various sizes running straight down the middle. We swear these pointy claws are longer than her own fingers — it might be one of the longest sets she has had to date.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Saweetie\\'s birthday look is as gorgeous and icy as we expected.

It\\'s easy to see that they\\'ve been collaborating with their favorite nail artists to perfect the finishing touches of their red-carpet beauty looks for the big night, which honors amazing achievements in Black entertainment — music, acting, sports, and more. And we\\'d like to honor the manicurists who made sure the nominees\\', presenters\\', and guests\\' hands were ready for their closeups.The first half of 2022 has been unpredictable in terms of nail trends, with some stars remaining true to elaborate and super-long looks and others taking a more neutral, subtle approach to their nails — and there\\'s a place for all of it at the 2022 BET Awards. Here are our favorite manicures of the night.Billy PorterGetty ImagesLiterally everything about Billy Porter\\'s look is show-stopping, including his manicure.

But, what if I told you there\\'s another radiance-intensifying ingredient that\\'s also a staple in your jewelry box? That\\'s right, I\\'m talking about gold, which is one of the many luminosity-amplifying ingredients in 111Skin\\'s Rose Gold Radiance Booster.111Skin is no stranger to luxury beauty: the brand has started gaining some serious hype from celebs like Kesha and it\\'s become a repeat feature in the Allure Beauty Box for its impressive, skin-nourishing formulations. Even our very own associate features director Dianna Mazzone is a fan of the brand, particularly 111Skin\\'s Vitamin C Brightening Booster. So, I already knew I was in good hands when this fancy-schmancy rose gold bottle first landed on my desk.Courtesy of brandImmediately, I did a quick scan of the label to see if my sensitive, rosacea-stricken skin could handle the formula. The serum contains a few ingredients that are already in my skin-care regimen: hydrating hyaluronic acid, brightening niacinamide, and soothing rosewater. \"The best known effect of rosewater is being anti-inflammatory, which can reduce redness and swelling in the skin,\" Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist James Wang, MD, says of the latter ingredient. \"The hydrating and antibacterial benefits, combined with its ability to calm the skin, can be especially helpful in some patients with inflammatory acne and rosacea.\"But what made me raise my eyebrows in skepticism was the pure gold extract. This may seem like a gimmicky ingredient, but Dr. Wang says that this precious metal can actually have a purpose in your skin-care routine. He notes that gold actually is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and claims of targeting fine lines and wrinkles. \"Although not a fully proven effect, gold is thought to help with wrinkles and signs of sun damage by also boosting collagen production,\" he says. With all of this in mind, Dr. Wang says this ingredient can be irritating to sensitive skin or those allergic to gold, so always patch test this product before applying it to your face.According to the bottle\\'s directions, there are two ways you can use this product: alone after cleansing or mixed into your favorite moisturizer. Whichever path you choose, the brand recommends using one to two drops. I decided to try both avenues of application simply out of curiosity and I\\'ve found that its slippery formula absorbs equally as well, regardless of how you apply it.As for its texture, the Rose Gold Radiance Booster is shimmery and has a slippery feel to it, almost like a champagne-hued version of a snail mucin serum. Once I applied it to my skin, the first thing I noticed was how teensy the gold particles were, which didn\\'t irritate my skin at all. It left a reflective veil of natural-looking shimmer without looking too intense or dramatic, and because of this, I\\'ve been reserving this sparkly serum for my morning skin-care regimen.Jennifer Hussein for AllureSo, is this gold-infused serum really worth the triple-digit price tag? Considering the fact that I\\'ve been using it daily for two months and have seen a major difference in the radiance of my complexion, my answer is a million times over, absolutely. Sure, there are many brightening skin-care products on the market, but as someone who\\'s tested hundreds of these formulations, 111Skin\\'s iridescent serum provided significant results that I haven\\'t achieved with other picks. And, at the very least, it\\'s literally liquid gold for your face, so why not treat yourself to a little luxury?111Skin Rose Gold Radiance Booster$135Want to try it for yourself? The 111Skin Rose Gold Radiance Booster is available for $135 now at dermstore.com and 111skin.com.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesRead more about our favorite luxury beauty products:I\\'ve Been Through Three Bottles of This $195 SerumTatcha\\'s The Clarifying Clay Mask Is a 5-Minute Ticket to Radiant SkinThe Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000 Is So Good, I Stopped Getting Professional BlowoutsNow, watch actress and Allure September cover star Millie Bobby Brown take on new skills:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'In 2010, when Betina Goldstein was fresh out of college, she began her career working for as a Post Production intern for a little show called Saturday Night Live, in addition to gigs in audience casting for shows such as the Food Network\\'s Beat Bobby Flay and MTV\\'s Teen Mom reunions and Hip Hop Squares.A year later, when working with a production company as a freelance production assistant on a photo shoot, one of her producers asked if she knew how to do nails.Goldstein never would\\'ve guessed that within the next 11 years, she\\'d become an ambassador for Chanel, the nail artist of an endless list of celebrity clientele, such as Zoë Kravitz, Julia Garner, Shawn Mendes,Olivia Rodrigo, and Rosalía, and amass a social following of 384,000 (and counting) Instagram followers.\"I became obsessed with teaching myself techniques to achieve greater detail and texture on this tiny canvas attached to my finger,\" Goldstein tells Allure. \"Nail art not only is my profession, but it has become a way of therapy. Each design I create is a reflection of who I am.\"Short Nail Art InspirationGrowing up in Texas with family from Mexico City, Goldstein has had a wide variety of influences on her nail designs, the biggest of which was museum art. She developed an appreciation of the techniques of Diego Rivera, the Mexican painter who became Frida Kahlo\\'s husband, the color palette combinations of Josef Albers, the German artist who was the first to get solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art and the Met in New York, and the styles of her grandparents\\' house in Mexico City, which was designed by Architect Luis Barragán.\"I believe Barragán\\'s work is a study of the language of the colors of México,\" she says. \"Being surrounded by a wide palette definitely shaped my understanding of the interplay between colors and how colors affect emotions, which has impacted my designs greatly.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.When it comes to creating designs now, Goldstein uses her own style and life as inspiration. Because she uses her hands for work —through manicures and jewelry design (did we mention she owns two brands, Doublemoss Jewelry and Doublemoss Arte?) —she found that short nails are the most functional.How to Shape Short NailsGoldstein explains that shaping has the biggest impact on creating the illusion of longer nails. She\\'s a big fan of the tapered oval and square shapes but recommends avoiding flat square nails because they can make your nails look shorter. In terms of trends, every design can look good on short nails, Goldstein says, citing French tips and negative space nails as examples, but it\\'s the way the design is styled that matters.\"If you do a thick, flat French tip, it makes your short nail look shorter,\" she says, opposed to a daintier, more curved tip. \"Negative space nails work wonders for shorter nails. A clean sheer base helps minimize the attention on the nail and focus on the art.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Celebrities Who Love Short NailsWhen navigating designs with clients, Goldstein\\'s biggest goal is to make sure the nails complement the entire look, especially when doing celebrity nails for red carpet events (her résumé includes several Met Galas, U.S. press for The Batman, and The Academy of Motion Pictures Museum Opening Gala, but no big deal).Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I never want the nail art to take over,\" she says. \"Nail art is not for everyone, and I like to respect that by never pushing it on any of my clients.\"Goldstein also enjoys how collaborative the nail art process can be, naming her method with Gemma Chan, whose nails she did for the Met Gala in 2019 and 2021 and The Eternals premiere in London, as an example.\"I create a design based on what she is wearing and then consult Gemma for any tweaks or changes,\" she says. \"I love that Gemma isn\\'t scared to take risks with nails and respects the art.\"Goldstein is making major strides in bringing short nails back, and we\\'re obsessed with all of her designs. To sum it all up, we\\'d say she\\'s nailing it.

To be real, anything \"boiling over\" on our face is something we\\'d like to avoid.According to the National Eczema Association, 31.6 million people in the U.S. have some form of eczema, making it one of the most common skin conditions. If you\\'re experiencing red, irritated skin on your face (especially your eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, or chin), there\\'s a fairly good chance it\\'s facial eczema. You may already have it elsewhere on your body, or it could be on your face alone. And while there is no study evaluating the prevalence of facial eczema, specifically, New York City-based dermatologist Neil Sadick, MD, says he believes the disorder affects about a third of the population.With facial eczema, you\\'ll have to do a bit of detective work to identify what\\'s causing it. There are a few types — atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis being the two most common forms — and they act a little differently. Some types will resolve in a few weeks with treatment, while other cases are chronic and need constant management. But you\\'re not alone. There are solutions as well as ways to keep it under control.Facial eczema can be itchy, flaky, and frustrating — your face is usually the first thing people see — and with so many types of eczema to parse through, it can be overwhelming. To help, we spoke with several board-certified dermatologists to find out what exactly constitutes facial eczema, what triggers the condition, and most importantly, how to keep symptoms at bay.Meet the experts:Macrene Alexiades, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center of New York in New York City.Hadley King, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Anthony Rossi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Neil Sadick, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Adam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C.Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Read MoreBody & Mind GuideSymptoms, treatment options, and personal experiences for various physical, mental, and health conditions and concerns.ArrowIn this story:What Is Facial Eczema?Causes of Facial EczemaHow to Prevent Facial EczemaHow to Treat Facial EczemaShould I Treat Facial Eczema Differently Than I Would Eczema on My Body?What Should I Do if Over-The-Counter Products Aren\\'t Cutting It?What Is Facial Eczema?\"Eczema is an inflammation of the skin caused by either an allergen or irritant,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Anthony Rossi, MD. It can also be genetic, and triggered by irritants.Facial eczema has many different symptoms that can manifest themselves differently from person to person, but some common things to look for are red patches, itchy skin, stinging, and dryness. With darker skin tones, it also tends to be scaly, says Dr. Rossi.Eczema is a common condition that can appear anywhere on the body, but if you\\'re grappling with facial eczema, it\\'s likely on the eyelids, eyebrows, cheeks, or chin. And while it is common, you definitely should bring it to your dermatologist. \"Eczema that develops near the eyes needs special attention because the eyes themselves can be affected,\" adds Dr. Alexiades. \"Those with eczema around the eyes are more susceptible to certain eye problems such as conjunctivitis, inflamed cornea, and changes in the shape of the cornea, a condition called keratoconus.\"Causes of Facial EczemaThere are a few different types of facial eczema — which will be key in not just identifying what you\\'re dealing with, but how you treat it. The most common type of facial eczema is atopic dermatitis. \"Atopic dermatitis is genetic and flares can be triggered by dry environmental conditions, not moisturizing, stress, and allergies,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Hadley King, MD.The second type is contact dermatitis, which comes from exposure to an irritating substance or something you may be allergic to (common perpetrators are cosmetics, dyes, soaps, detergents, fragrance, or smoke — in addition to environmental allergens like pet dander or pollen). \"Some people break out in an eczema rash after eating certain foods, such as nuts, shellfish, milk, and eggs,\" says Dr. Alexiades.Try to note when you see an eczema flare and note any common denominators to your dermatologist. This should help both you and your dermatologist narrow it down and get to the root cause.How to Prevent Facial EczemaThe best way to prevent eczema on the face is the most obvious but perhaps the most important method: identify the trigger and remove it. \"For example, if you notice red patches when you wear jewelry, you may be allergic to nickel. Stop wearing jewelry and your eczema may go away,\" says Dr. Alexiades. \"If you notice red itchy patches after a night out, it may be perfume that is your trigger, in which case stop wearing fragrances and look for fragrance-free cosmetics.\"The same goes for cosmetics and skincare. \"Know what’s in your skincare and if you’re prone to allergies,\" says Dr. Rossi. It may be beneficial to go on a \"product diet.\" Pare down your routine to one gentle product (a cleanser is a good place to start) and add them back in slowly, one by one, to see if you can identify which product is causing your facial eczema. Patch testing—applying a small amount of a product to the sensitive skin on the inside of the arm to see if there is a reaction within 24 hours—can also help to narrow things down.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf you find that your flare-ups happen when you\\'re stressed, you may need to identify some lifestyle changes like taking on fewer projects, getting more rest, or finding more time for mindfulness. Likewise, if you notice that your facial eczema gets worse in dry or hot weather, try to plan ahead for AC breaks, come prepared with sunscreen, and find a thicker and more reliable moisturizer that can hang on all day.How to Treat Facial EczemaSometimes, simply removing your facial eczema triggers will totally cure your skin within weeks. But if your facial eczema is very severe and you can\\'t identify any bad actors, you may want to try over-the-counter hydrocortisone or get a topical steroid prescription from your dermatologist. \"A topical corticosteroid cream will help treat any of the causes of facial eczema,\" says Dr. King. “Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects.” They can be used as needed to treat flares but not for ongoing maintenance, according to the National Eczema Association, since prolonged use can cause withdrawal side effects like red, irritated skin and pimple-like papules.Dr. Rossi adds that antihistamines can be an effective short-term solution if the eczema is caused by an allergen. Otherwise, \"there are more systemic medications for severe or widespread cases,\" he says.How to Curb Flare-upsNot all types of eczema have a surefire \"cure,\" but you can definitely make it more manageable and lessen your flare-ups. You may be able to curb irritation with good lifestyle habits, over-the-counter products, and consistent skincare with gentle but moisturizing products.\"Good, gentle care of your skin is the most important aspect of treating facial eczema,\" says Dr. Alexiades, who recommends fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products if you find that you’re prone to flare-ups. \"Consider a mild cleanser and wash your face with lukewarm water, since heat can cause a flare-up.\"Dr. Alexiades also touts the benefits of keeping your skin hydrated. She recommends moisturizers with emollient ingredients like ceramides and cosmetics that also have moisturizing ingredients. \"Having facial eczema doesn’t mean you can never wear makeup, but not all products are the same,\" she says. \"Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and shea butter.\" Moisturizers and cosmetics with moisturizing ingredients (like hyaluronic acid and shea butter) can help to protect the outer skin barrier—which can be damaged or compromised by eczema, according to the National Eczema Association.Should I treat facial eczema differently than I would eczema on my body?Yes. Both Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, and Dr. Sadick recommend using milder products on your face because the skin is thinner and more sensitive than the skin on your body. \"I would use eczema skin-care products designed for face and body respectively as they contain different concentrations of active ingredients,\" says Dr. Sadick.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesAdam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., recommends using weaker topical steroids, as he says, \"facial skin is more sensitive to the skin thinning and lightening effect of topical steroids.\" According to a study by the National Eczema Association, prolonged use of strong topical steroids can cause a host of withdrawal symptoms once you stop using the cream—like burning, stinging, papules, or pimple-like bumps. However, short-term use is safe and effective with the guidance of a dermatologist.What should I do if over-the-counter products aren\\'t cutting it?Sadly, sometimes eczema on the face can prove extremely stubborn to the point where treatment may need to be prescribed by a doctor. \"If home treatments are not helping, you may need prescription medications,\" says Dr. Shah. \"I usually prescribe either a topical steroid or a topical calcineurin inhibitor, a non-steroidal medication that can reduce inflammation and treat eczema.\"Dr. Shah says she sometimes prescribes special moisturizers called barrier repair creams for patients. And if the eczema is severe and not responding to topical treatments, other options include phototherapy, aka light therapy. There\\'s a wide range of treatment options for facial eczema, so it often comes down to trial and error in order to figure out what works for you. We\\'d recommend always consulting your dermatologist before trying anything new.Read more about caring for skin conditions:6 Skin-Care Ingredients to Add to Your Routine If You Have EczemaHow to Treat Scalp Eczema, According to DermatologistsWhy Colloidal Oatmeal Should Be Part of Your Skin-Care RegimenYou can follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on all things beauty.', 'The 2022 Met Gala is here and back on the first Monday of May. This year, celebrities were challenged with the theme, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion,\" with an emphasis on gilded glamour. Tonight, stars are showing how they\\'re channeling the essence of the Gilded Age with black gowns, lengthy nails, and extravagant headpieces.The vintage waves and slicked-back chignons may be nice, but headpieces are the star of the show at this year\\'s version of the fashion event — and rightfully so. Simple headwear like bedazzled tiaras and golden headbands made their appearance alongside elaborate fascinators and massive hats. It\\'s clear that head coverings are key to the gilded glamour theme, and here are some of our favorite ones.Flaming DiscsGetty ImagesLa La Anthony arrived earlier in the night in a burgundy two-piece with a swirly manicure and a large red headpiece that captured our attention. On one side, there\\'s a large circular piece with red ovular pieces woven together. But, on the other side, the headpiece looks completely different — large and small candy apple-red roses shine, bringing this all-over red ensemble together.Hint of PinkGetty ImagesSarah Jessica Parker took our breaths away and clearly understood the gilded glamour assignment with her black-and-white Christopher John Roberts gown and detailed fascinator. This black netted piece covers part of her face, but it gets even better as your eyes travel up. Rolled pieces of black mesh pop out at the top alongside numerous strings with tiny diamond pieces in black and white. The fuchsia flower and leaves add a touch of color to this look that just makes sense.Abstract HaloGetty ImagesWinnie Harlow stepped on the carpet in a short abstract white dress topped with an intricate white-and-golden headpiece that we can\\'t quite describe. There\\'s thin golden rods that flow from the back of her head connecting to the clear-and-white, sharp abstract pieces that curl out from the sides of her head. This piece almost reminds us of the legs of an insect.Covered in SilverGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThis is far from the first headpiece Janelle Monáe has worn on the red carpet, and it won\\'t be the last one we ooooh and ahhhh over. The black-and-silver, striped hood connects to her bedazzled gown, which is the same color, and covers her entire head. It\\'s the epitome of glamour and excellence.Tiny TiarasGetty ImagesEmma Chamberlain was in the salon for hours the day before the Met Gala to achieve this light platinum blonde hair. Her blunt bob was parted down the middle and tucked behind her ears with a silver bedazzled tiara. This tiara isn\\'t in-your-face, but the delicate piece matches her studded accessories well.Pieces of GoldGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesTommy Dorfman made a statement with her hunter green, latex dress with black leather gloves. The small golden headband on her head complements the gold pieces on her cut-out dress. Tiny squarish shapes are all over the top of the headband.Birds of a Feather Getty ImagesQuannah Chasinghorse always brings her culture wherever she goes. For the Met Gala, she paired a large feather headpiece with a voluminous, baby blue tulle dress. The feathers were attached to intricate braids on one side of her head and look stunning with her jewelry.Bathed in WhiteGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesCynthia Erivo\\'s towering white headwrap references the Tignon Laws, which was a law in the late 1800s that forced Black women to cover their hair. The white wrap is also an ode to the many types of headwraps Black women wear around the globe. We\\'re loving the height and volume of this chalk-white headpiece.Wide BrimsGetty ImagesSZA was clearly embracing the saying \"go big or go home,\" with her hot pink gown, a massive black hat, and latex gloves and thigh-high boots. The sheer size of this hat was impressive, and we would love to know if it stayed put the whole night or if she had to take it off to avoid accidentally hitting someone. At the back of the hat is a fuzzy boa that reached below the singer\\'s waist.Sequins GaloreGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSequins and gems had a huge moment at the 2022 Met Gala. Jessica Chastain decided to shine in a long-sleeve, garnet gown with a silver snake that wrapped around the dress. She paired the look with a turban headband in the same red sequins as the dress for a matchy-matchy moment. The hair accessory also has a silver element with a jeweled brooch at the very center of her head — it\\'s lavish, glitzy, and flashy, which is apt for the glamourous theme.Netted VisionGetty ImagesClaire Danes\\'s slicked-back bob was accessorized with a black fascinator that covered most of her face and ears. This netted design was on the simpler side and almost looked like a bunch of small soda plastic rings woven together.One KnotGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesLily Aldridge is another celebrity who matched her entire outfit from head to toe. Her gown, gloves, and headscarf all had the same silver-studded black design. The bejeweled scarf was tied simply right below her neck for a chic but simple look.Golden GloryGetty ImagesNatasha Poonawalla did not skimp out on any gold on the red carpet. Her brown gown was covered in sequins and accessorized with several large gold pieces of jewelry. She even added a golden headband full of multicolored jewels in different sizes. But the main attraction was the golden corset-like piece that extends into a large headpiece. Three thin metal pieces formed a trio of circles around her head and neck, covering a portion of her face. Shorter pieces of gold curl outward on the rings matched the swirly metal on her chest area.With a TiltGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNormani arrived in a velvet black two-piece set with a brand new hair color. Her brown hair was traded in for a dark reddish hue the color of Merlot. Her swirly updo was decorated with a wavy black velvet fascinator with a bow.Looking Into FutureGetty ImagesTeyana Taylor combined the past and the future with her silver jeweled headpiece that cover her face. On each side of her head, tiny pieces with lavender jewels at the end jut out and work well with her marbled purple dress.Dazzling SequinsGetty ImagespMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesMJ Rodriguez shined literally in her hooded sequined, ombré gown.

On June 15, the icon announced that her seventh album, titled Renaissance, is dropping on July 29. Even though she alerted her fans of the upcoming music a month in advance — a striking difference from when she released her self-titled album in 2013 without any promotion — she still made sure to keep us on our toes by sharing the exciting news in the middle of the night and appearing on the July cover of British Vogue just a few hours later.This cover is nothing short of magnificent — and the Beyhive agrees. The \"Spirit\" singer looks like royalty sitting on top of a horse in an all-black Maison Alaia gown with a massive feather headpiece. The rest of the photo shoot is just as breathtaking and extravagant. In one image, she appears in another black outfit but with a leather jacket, black box braids that hairstylist Jawara twisted into what looks like Bantu knots, and a glossy black lip, painted by her longtime makeup artist, Sir John. She looks like the baddest person to ever live sitting on top of a motorcycle instead of a horse.The hair and headpieces were clearly a focal priority in this shoot. They are striking, futuristic, and risky. In a few photos, she has dark hair instead of her usual blonde-highlighted strands, which is making some fans wonder if Queen Bey will be returning to her brunette era for this new album.Getty ImagesBut there is one other hairstyle that is sparking some strong reactions from the Beyhive. The hairstyle in question is the choppy baby fringe she wears with a gilded Schiaparelli Haute Couture outfit and jewelry. These short bangs are far from Beyonce\\'s norm and took several Twitter fans back to 2014, one of the few other times we have seen her with baby bangs.If you don\\'t remember that fringe, let me jog your memory for a second — they were thick, very blunt, and super short, stopping several inches about her forehead. She wore similar bangs in her \\'60s-inspired music video for \"Why Don\\'t You Love Me,\" which was released four years prior.

Another jokingly noted that the fringe was probably styled by one of her five-year-old twins. \"I love that Beyoncé always includes her kids in her work, the fact that she got rumi and sir to cut her bangs/style her hair,\" the tweet reads.Regardless of your feelings about the baby fringe, we\\'re sure you\\'re more than excited for the upcoming album — we definitely are. Some fans are thinking it\\'s going to include disco and house influences due to rumors about artists she is collaborating with and the overall vibe of the shoot; it blends retro elements, such as a giant disco ball and platform boots, and futuristic designs. We won\\'t fully know until July 29, but we\\'re sure that Beyoncé will deliver hits as she always has.Read more stories about bangs:21 Types of Bangs to Consider If You\\'re Ready to Take the PlungeBottleneck Bangs Are the New, Daintier Take on Curtain BangsYour Guide to Styling, Maintaining, and Growing Out Curtain BangsNow enjoy this pro-dancers entire daily routine:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'In our humble opinion, nothing beats the rush of getting a needle poked through your skin for a piercing. Among the various ways to express yourself through body modification, they\\'re relatively low risk and just plain ol\\' fun.Piercing trends tend to ebb and flow. Some locations, like the ear lobe, seemingly never go out of style while other placements, like the belly button, resurge in popularity every few years or so. The COVID-19 pandemic affected many folks\\' ability to get piercings as mask-covered areas became off-limits. But, as tattoo and piercing shops open back up, more people have been willing to experiment, whether it\\'s by adding new jewelry to old holes or getting something entirely new.We chatted with a few piercers to learn about all the ear and body piercing trends you should expect in the new year. Here are the piercing trends you\\'ll be seeing everywhere in 2022.Ear CurationsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyThe ear is a popular site for piercings, but recently more folks are seeking out ear curations, according to piercer Amber Maysonet who works at Live by the Sword Tattoo. \"It\\'s basically a mapping and planning for either now or future piercings for your ears,\" she explains. Ear curations involve giving the piercer the creative freedom to choose multiple piercings for you while taking into account your aesthetic and your ear\\'s anatomy to figure out the best placements and jewelry. Sometimes these curations also involve adding new jewelry to already existing piercings to ensure everything works together.Maysonet cites social media, especially TikTok, as the reason why she thinks more people are choosing these curations. \"When you look at [these piercings], especially on social media, you see how good everything goes together and how nice [they] look on somebody else, obviously you\\'re like, \\'OMG, I can do that,\\'\" she shares.At Brooklyn\\'s So Gold Studies, piercer and founder Cassi Lopez-March requires that clients have at least three existing piercings and be willing to get one to three additional piercings during an ear curation session. She finds that more of her clients are seeking out \"full-blown ear styling\" rather than coming in with pre-determined placements because the average person does not always know what they want. \"When someone gives us free reign to kind of have fun with it, that\\'s when the magic happens,\" she shares.OrbitalsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyIf you google \"orbital piercing,\" you\\'ll see a couple of different piercing locations, but don\\'t let the internet confuse you, Cassi Lopez-March says. \"An actual orbital is just one ring that connects two holes,\" she explains. You can get two new piercings or use new jewelry to connect older ones. She has noticed this placement becoming extremely popular with clients who want to refresh their old holes and give them a new life. At her shop, they tend to add orbitals to the lobe area to connect second or even third piercings.NavalCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2017, I fulfilled one of my childhood dreams of getting a belly button piercing. I remember a friend of mine was a bit shocked that I chose the location given that it was no longer \"popular.\" But it looks like I may have been ahead of the curve (and honestly, I don\\'t make my decisions on trends alone) because both Maysonet and Lopez-March see a resurgence in belly rings coming soon.Just like fashion and beauty trends, nostalgia is winning once again with piercings, seeing as belly rings had their last heyday in the 2000s. But Maysonet has seen folks adding a bit of a twist to the placement by getting both the top and bottom of their bellies pierced rather than choosing just one or the other.Flat HelixCourtesy of Instagram/@studsFolks are becoming more interested in receiving multiple piercings at once rather than just one. \"Right now, I think the piercing trends of 2022 are being influenced by the excitement and relief of returning to travel, celebrations, and concerts with new trends of bold self-expression,\" Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of piercing studio Studs where they focus exclusively on ear piercings, shares. That\\'s why she predicts that a trio of piercings on the flat helix will be big in the new year.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe flat helix is specifically the flat area of cartilage located in the upper ear. Bubbers says it\\'s a great spot because you can try out a few different types of jewelry options and have fun with customization. She\\'s also noticed an increase in asymmetrical placements, which can be done in this area.EyebrowGetty ImagesRecently, we\\'ve noticed certain celebrities with new eyebrow piercings — some fake, some real. On September 27, Lil Nas X showed off his new eyebrow piercing on TikTok to fans\\' praise. (Since then we haven\\'t really seen it make another appearance, so who knows if the jewelry was just a fake-out.)Cardi B debuted her own eyebrow piercing during Paris Fashion Week in one of the best ways possible. She showed out in an extravagant red Mugler dress and cape with bedazzled red brows and a silver ring through her left eyebrow. The eyebrow was a popular piercing location in the \\'90s and 2000s, and it seems like it will be reentering the mainstream in 2022.Snakebites/StacksCourtesy of Instagram/@ileanastabbedmeMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2019, Studs created their signature \"Snakebite\" piercing, which model Kaia Gerber helped make popular. The name may be a bit confusing if you\\'re used to the Snakebite lip piercing — which typically means two piercings spaced out at each outer corner of the lower lip — but this is an ear piercing that involves stacking two holes close together on the outer cartilage of the mid-ear area. Bubbers says they expect to see folks trying the piercing in new places like the Forward Helix and Conch in 2022.The jewelry in these holes is just as important as the piercings themselves. Scrolling through Studs\\'s Instagram, you\\'ll see ears full of these Snakebite piercings with gold and silver jewelry in all shapes and sizes.NosesCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMaysonet has also seen an increase in nose piercings, both on the nostril and the septum. She cites the resurgence of punk, alternative, and even scene aesthetics as the impetus for this rise. We\\'re also willing to bet that once mask mandates are lifted in certain areas that it will allow more people to finally try the piercing placement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesYou can get a simple septum or nostril piercing or go all out and try two piercings, whether that be with one hole in each nostril, two holes in one nostril, or a septum and nostril piercing. It\\'s up to you to decide what kind of fun you\\'re into.With the unpredictability of the past two years, there\\'s truly no knowing what will happen in the piercing world. But we are sure that more and more folks will continue to dip into creativity and give their piercer freedom to guide them along their piercing journey.Read more stories about body modification:Contraconch Piercings Are Gaining Popularity For Their Unexpected PlacementYour Complete Guide to Vulva PiercingsHow Your Belly Button Piercing Changes When You Get PregnantNow watch 100 years of piercings:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'It almost felt like the MTV VMAs were back to their pre-pandemic form tonight at the 2022 show. Nicki Minaj, LL Cool J, and Jack Harlow hosted and kept us entertained throughout the music-filled night. Minaj was even awarded the 2022 VMA Video Vanguard award, both exciting and well deserved. In addition to these three celebs, Lizzo, Bad Bunny, and Anitta all blessed the stage with their voices.The performances were amazing, and our eyes were zoned in on what these stars were wearing from head to toe, both on and off the stage. They were already wowing us with their massive feather headpieces, face jewelry, and slicked-back hair, but we were also obsessing over all the manicures. Here are just a few that we are loving.Dove CameronGetty ImagesDove Cameron went for dark grunge vibes at the awards show. She paired her strapless leather and floral gown with smoked-out burgundy eye makeup, plum glossy lips, and stiletto-shaped nails.

For example, there were deep red rose charms and silver gems on each middle finger. If you look closely, you might have noticed the black scissor decals on each ring fingernail.Betty WhoGetty ImagesThe Australian-born singer-songwriter showed up with black-and-white graphic nails. Each hand had different nail designs. On one hand, there were various sizes of white and black stars on each nail. The other hand had white hearts on the index and ring fingers. The white design on the middle finger was actually an ode to the awards show; it\\'s the iconic MTV logo.Monét X ChangeGetty ImagesMonét X Change had already caught over eyes with her large afro puffs and bright tropical-inspired makeup, but we made sure not to forget her white swirly tips.

Her bedazzled metallic nails practically blend into her dress in the above photo. The medium-length, almond-shaped nails were full of sparkly gems and jewels.Lil Nas XGetty ImagesNow, hearing the words \"goth Big Bird\" probably sounds like the strangest and worst thing in the world, but we swear Lil Nas X\\'s VMAs outfit will make you rethink that. The rapper showed out with a massive black feather headpiece with matching pants. It\\'s hard to take your eyes off this elaborate feather piece, but the mismatched manicure he wore that night also deserves some fanfare.OPI Nail Lacquer in Bubble Bath$11OPI Nail Lacquer in Black Onyx$11Two nails on each hand were painted completely black by nail artist Temeka Jackson who used OPI GelColor polishes, which are exclusively available to nail artists, to complete this look. Thankfully, the two shades she used, Bubble Bath (pale pink) and Black Onyx (pitch black), are available in nail lacquer form, so this look can be recreated at home. With the Black Onyx polish and a thin brush, she drew French tips, geometric shapes, and lines to create the nail art.Becky GGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesBecky G looked gorgeous in a sequined gown that looked just like a stained glass window.

The different clips stitched together show the model in a pink velvet bathing suit (ah, a true sign of an L.A. winter) with frosty pink eye makeup and matching pink butterfly clips pulling her hair back from her face.\"Todays vibe,\" the nonchalant caption reads, along with a couple of emojis. Throughout the video, Bieber smiles and makes duck faces while she shows off her look. Her hair is middle-parted and styled with natural beach waves and baby braids. As for makeup, she\\'s opted for layered pink eye shadow: a lighter shade on her inner lids, and a darker hue on her outer lids. Pink glitter serves as her eyeliner, which rims both lash lines and extends outward into a baby wing. The monochromatic look also features a rosy blush, a pink lip color, and soft highlighter on her cheek bones. We\\'re taking notes, and plan on channeling this look all spring long.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.For her nails, she\\'s staying on-trend with a classic French oval manicure so simple that it doesn\\'t take away from her finger tattoos. And she didn\\'t miss with her jewelry either, which matches the theme of this Y2K-inspired TikTok. She\\'s wearing a few necklaces, including mixed and matched pearls with a custom letter bead necklace (although we can\\'t read what it spells out), two belly chains, and gold hoop earrings.We love all of Hailey\\'s content (shout-out to her skin-care tips, pictures with Justin, and TikTok dances), but we can\\'t get enough of her glowing beauty looks, either.

And while it's all too common for some to slouch when it comes to following the theme of the night, one guest nailed it in the gilded glamor department at the 2022 Met Gala. Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers. It was shiny gold and covered in ruby and pearl-looking appliqués. She also sported a gold, armor-esque covering on her other pointer finger. The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore. Somehow, it was both a retro and futuristic look all at once. And one that set the hearts of internet critics aflame.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.King kept the rest of her beauty look simple, with cropped hair and minimal-looking makeup. Because why take attention away from the nail situation?

If that wasn\\'t enough, the \"Kiss Me More\" singer made our jaws drop with the stunning Schiaparelli black gown and gold accessories she wore for the awards show. By now we expect the pop star to capture our attention with every new look, but we didn\\'t expect her to show up to the event with short nails or intricate gold rings that look like they\\'re worth more than my student loans.The \"Say So\" singer didn\\'t hesitate to take risks for this look, something we love from her. Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas gave her a neutral smokey eye with a hint of bright yellow on the inner crease and waterline that complemented the daring gown very well. As for her hair, hairstylist Jared Henderson (known as JStay Ready to many) slicked her dark hair into a high ponytail with a flipped end that we have a good feeling was fun to whip around.Getty ImagesTypically Doja Cat wears lengthy nails, but for this look, she kept them short. Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe. But this manicure is anything but simple, because this opulent jewelry is basically nail art.Her middle finger had the largest ring, which covered her entire finger and nail. The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own. The other two rings were simpler, which is saying something.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one!

The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me.

One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade. As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says.

As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says.

Yep, it\\'s equally as disappointing when you find an eye-catching set of earrings only to find it\\'s made of materials that could irritate your skin. Sure, they say pain is beauty, but when that pain involves itchiness, redness, and uncomfortable rashes (on an already-thin and sensitive part of your skin, no less), it begs the question: \"were these hoops really worth it?\" The short answer is, well, no.And remember: you\\'ll know if your piercing is infected if it\\'s red, inflamed, sore, hot to touch, or if it\\'s releasing puss. You should consult with your physician if you suspect you have an infection.The truth is, if you\\'re someone who struggles with finding earrings that won\\'t cause discomfort, you may have to work a little harder to find your match. \"Unfortunately, sterling silver jewelry is made with a mix of metals, often nickel, which is the most significant irritant to sensitive ears,\" explains Ottawa-based medical director of Concept Medical Samuel Hetz, MD. \"Those with sensitive ears want to find hypoallergenic rhodium-plated jewelry with low to no nickel content.\" He recommends looking for the standard benchmarks of 14k gold or above as well as sterling silver 925 grade to reduce the chances of nickel content.Because we don\\'t believe those with sensitive skin should be left out of the party, we rounded up nine of the best earrings for sensitive ears that are always stylish, and never irritating.BaubleBar Sutara 18K Gold Earrings$48 at BaubleBar$42 at NordstromFor sensitive-skinned folks, Baublebar\\'s Sutara Earrings will make you thank your lucky stars they\\'re made out of 18k gold.

All around me were people filling in or touching up their ink, but I continued onward past the buzzing needles — straight to the back, where the piercer works. After a tough year, I was ready for a bit of body modification to memorialize the challenges and symbolize the jump forward into 2022. What I didn\\'t realize, as I asked for a third lobe piercing to continue to build my stack of hoops, is that my bright idea was of a pace with a wide new piercing trend.More and more customers are asking for what Alaina Rothstein, cofounder of Los Angeles ear piercing service Leo West, refers to as a \"milestone piercing.\" Rothstein has seen mothers and daughters come in for birthday piercing; she knows of a woman who miscarried and got a stud to remind her of the loss. \"It\\'s a fun, really beautiful way to carry something special with you in happy times and in sad times,\" she says. \"And I think it\\'s like super cool that it\\'s translated [from the tattoo world] into the piercing world.\"Our piercers have seen birthdays, bachelorette parties, and groups of friends come in to celebrate together. But what trends are they trying, specifically? In other words, which parts of the ear are getting the most adoration through adornment right now?Meet the experts:Alaina Rothstein and Jill Katz, RN, cofounders of Los Angeles ear-piercing service Leo WestLisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a piercing studio with locations in New York, Texas, and California (among others)Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer at Live by the Sword Tattoo in Brooklyn, New YorkIn This Story:Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?How to Pick Your PiercerConstellation PiercingsStacked LobesVertical StacksForward HelixSnakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)ConchOuter Conch, a.k.a. SconchJump ahead, or read on for everything you need to know about the freshest ear-piercing trends, as well as the estimated length of time the healing process may take.Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?Milestones are one reason customers are flocking to their local licensed piercer, but another is a generalized sense of freedom and autonomy that\\'s arrived as a result of the pandemic. \"With remote work and workplace norms overall changing, more people are feeling free to experiment with bolder looks and express their personality,\" says Lisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a national piercing studio. That experimentation shows up both in the amount of piercings and in the piercings themselves, which are getting \"more creative,\" Bubbers says. (Plus, as Rothstein points out, \"one fun thing about mask-wearing is that your ears show.\")The last \"really important trend,\" as Leo West cofounder Jill Katz, RN describes it, is \"adorning what you got.\" There\\'s no normal, she says. A gorgeous earscape is all about working with your budget and your anatomy to create an embodiment of your style in tiny, beautiful silver, gold, or gem form.The result: forward helices, vertically stacked lobes, conches, sconches, snake bites, and plenty of other piercing types we never knew existed, spanning from the outer rims of the ear to the inner cartilage and back to the earlobe. Our trend-spotting piercers shared the adornments they\\'ve seen grow more popular over 2022, and what they envision for the years (and ears!) to come.How to Pick Your PiercerJust as with microblading, filler, or any other body modification, it\\'s important to find a professional piercer that you trust, with a style that appeals to you. This is an essential step, whether you’re a longtime body modification fan or it’s your first piercing ever.As Brooks notes, the benefit of following a piercer on social media is that you can seek them out and, as in one service she offers, put your ear(s) in her hands. During a \"curation\" appointment, the expert will look at your ear as a whole and help design multiple piercings to fit your style and your desires.At Leo West, that might look like getting multiple differentiated piercings on each ear. \"Symmetry is out,\" says Rothstein. As she points out, a specialist is extra helpful if you\\'re nervous about curating an asymmetrical look. \"It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t want ears that match, but it has to have a rhyme or reason to it,\" she says. \"I have two ears, and I like to say ‘one’s a little bit classy, one\\'s a little bit sassy.\\'\"Constellation PiercingsInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhile some of this year\\'s trends include holes in unexpected places, more of them involve third, fourth, or fifth additions to an already-pierced ear. At Leo West, the result is what they\\'ve named a \"constellation.\" A constellation consists of \"really small pieces, close together, closer than what your traditional spacing would be,\" explains Rothstein. The result is an \"intentionally random\" grouping of ear piercings that show off studs and gems.Stacked LobesInstagram user @leowestco\"People often come in [to the studio] and say \\'I’m not cool enough,\\'\" for a trendy piercing, recounts Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer in Brooklyn. If you\\'re intimidated by the thought of a conch piercing or even a constellation, Brooks thinks that an ear stack is an easier entry point. These piercings are less painful than their cartilage-filled brethren, and can make their way up the lobe either evenly spaced or placed close together.Vertical StacksInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"If I\\'m being honest, I love to put my hair behind my ear to show the little pops of pieces sitting right above your classic [piercing],\" laughs Rothstein. She\\'s referring to a vertical stack, which entails a piercing centered directly above your traditional first or second hole. It\\'s usually filled with a small stone or a small star, Rothstein\\'s favorite. This piercing does require a certain amount of space on the lobe, but if you have enough canvas to play with, it \"gives the ear a little extra uniqueness.\"Forward Helixcourtesy of StudsThe official name for that bouncy piece of cartilage where your ear meets your skull is the \"forward helix.\" According to Bubbers, customers are coming in requesting one or even multiple piercings on the forward helix. \"We do see new and different piercing trends emerge each year based on what’s trending in fashion, culture, and celebrity,\" she says. Celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Chantal Jeffries have helped popularize the new (and finicky — helix piercings can take up to nine months to heal) style.Snakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)In the realm of body piercing, the term \"snakebite\" typically refers to two piercings on either side of your lower lip, oftentimes barbells or studs.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen it comes to ears, however, it entails two holes placed close together, slightly separated from the rest of your ear piercings, giving the impression of that your piercer just might have used two fangs to get the job done. According to Bubbers, most customers opt for a snakebite in their “midi,\" the center point of the outer ear.ConchInstagram user @leowestcoWe\\'ve named conch piercings as of-trend for the past few years, but the cartilage piercing is still popular enough to remain on the list. It pierces through the inner-ear cartilage that makes up the back of the year. At Studs, Bubbers says customers are opting more and more for a snakebite on the conch for a doubly trendy effect.Outer Conch (Sometimes Known as a \"Sconch\")courtesy of Studs\"I hope you don\\'t use this name,\" laughs Brooks. She prefers the more medical-sounding \"outer conch,\" but the phrase \"sconch\" is catching on to describe a piercing placed at the lining ridge in the cavern space close to the center of the ear.\"It\\'s right in your eye-line when people look at you,\" she says, so it provides a way to show a bit of personality even when you\\'re on Zoom or wearing a mask. Because it\\'ll be eye-catching no matter what kind of earring(s) you have in, Brooks likes adorning an outer conch piercing with a piece of jewelry that makes a big statement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesMore on the world of piercings:How Tongue Piercings Work, From Pain Level and Placement to Aftercare and Healing TimeHow to Remove Every Type of Piercing at Home8 Types of Ear Piercings, ExplainedContraconch Ear Piercings Are Gaining Popularity for Its Unexpected PlacementIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?

That way, I have a scent memory anchored to that destination or time period for whenever I choose to relive it. My last international trip, to a prestigious wellness resort in Austria for some on-the-ground reporting, demanded a very specific choice: something compact enough to fit in my carry-on without getting tossed by TSA, calming enough to match the vibe of the Alpine oasis, and extra long-lasting so it would last through hikes, meals, and medical treatments without reapplication. Lastly, it would need to smell expensive, because my fellow wellness-seekers would expect as much — but we\\'ll get to that later.After much deliberation, I landed on a luxe new formula that had just hit my desk before my flight: the Jennifer Fisher My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil.My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil$65I was initially surprised that Jennifer Fisher, a jewelry designer beloved by her red carpet clientele and the master behind some of Jennifer Lopez\\'s favorite hoop earrings, had ventured into perfumery. That said, fragrance does feel like a sparkling accessory that amps up any outfit or beauty look, and Fisher wanted her new perfume oil to make a statement for the wearer. \"I want anyone wearing My Scent to feel confident and sexy,\" she tells Allure. “And to smell like a fresh baked cookie.\" Upon first wear, I didn\\'t flag baked goods as a top note, but I did instantly fall for the vanilla and coconut Fisher knew she wanted to include in the formula.\"The blend of vanilla and coconut brings back memories from my childhood growing up in Santa Barbara, California,\" she says. \"For years, I was combining different vanilla and coconut fragrances to try and create my own personal scent. Finding a scent that was a combination of surf wax from the beaches in my hometown, Montecito, and a fresh baked cookie is what I\\'ve always wanted.\"Australian sandalwood, pear, and Tonka bean flank the creamy hero notes, and it all comes together to smell equal parts sunny and cozy, like throwing on a cashmere sweater on a breezy summer night. Toting it around is just as effortless too: I carried the teeny-tiny rollerball in my airplane carry-on, my spa robe to and from massages and lunch, and even in my fanny pack while Nordic walking in the mountains.No, really, I took this tube everywhere with me.\\nTaylore Glynn\"I wanted to come out with something small, compact, and portable you could throw in your bag and take everywhere with you,\" says Fisher. \"A spray to me didn\\'t feel as transportable, but that doesn\\'t mean I am ruling it out for the next product. This oil was designed intentionally to be worn and carried on-the-go.\" In addition to being totable, the formula also fulfilled my need for something that would last through spa treatments and saunas.\"Coconut is a good oil carrier to round out scents,\" says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, noting that scent can last longer in oil form because it\\'s not watered down. \"Atomized scents usually contain alcohol to help spraying. Fragrance oil is the most concentrated form [you can find].\"The scent was so powerful that even my fellow resort guests noticed. In fact, I was flagged down multiple times in the dining room and in the halls to reveal what I was wearing because it smelled \"beautiful\" and \"divine.\" For important context, some of the resort guests on the premises at the time — who I can\\'t explicitly identify — included one of the most famous supermodels of our generation, an Oscar-winning actress, and an entirely different famous jewelry designer with whom I chatted about ketamine therapy. I realized that My Scent smelled flat-out expensive, which seems to be a selling point amongst perfume enthusiasts on social media. In fact, there\\'s a whole genre of #FragranceTok posts dedicated to perfumes that make you smell, well, rich. After studying these videos, there\\'s a handful of perfumes that seem to universally smell like wealth: Parfums de Marly Delina, Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Montale Paris Intense Cafe, and three different Maison Francis Kurkdjian perfumes.Courtesy of brandParfums de Marly Delina$335Courtesy of brandYves Saint Laurent Libre Eau de Parfum Spray$140 $112 at NordstromIntense Cafe Eau de Parfum$170Courtesy of brandMaison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540$325They all also happen to share one intoxicating note: vanilla, which lies at the heart of My Scent.

Well, we say it's time to take a moment to appreciate such bold choices, such as Doja Cat's quirky makeup looks from Paris Fashion week — she still has us wondering how her shirt remained white with all that gold. And we certainly can't leave out the Hadid sisters' bleached brows for their own prance down the very same runways. It's not much of a shocker, then, that Gigi Hadid went for something a bit odd and definitely bold for a recent red-carpet beauty moment. For the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards on November 7, Hadid graced the carpet with an unconventional cool gray lipstick.I'll be the first to admit that I did a double-take at first glimpse. No, it's not your typical choice where a lipstick shade is concerned, but makeup artists Patrick Ta and Akina Shimizu were able to pull off this muted-yet-fresh-faced makeup look on Hadid. Catch me zooming in on those lips that are seemingly matte and glossy at the same time. We're definitely not the only ones hoping the details will soon be dropped on what particular beauty brand this lipstick is made by. Nonetheless, this all-American color pallet is insanely cohesive.Let's also not forget the striking blonde hair color and the sleek, slicked-back bun hair stylist Laura Polko put together to bring out the jewelry on Hadid's ears and nose. My favorite part is the septum ring paired with the tartan-patterned Thom Browne attire styled by Mimi Cuttrell — it's full-on grunge. I'm honestly tempted to break out my alternative pop-rock playlist, like, now.

The supermodel went for a runway-ready vibe for both of her costumes this year, though they were extremely different in tone.For her first look, Bieber covered herself in roses to pay homage to an Yves Saint Laurent haute couture runway look from 1999, originally worn by model Laetitia Casta. In her carousel of pics, Bieber wears a top and miniskirt made of huge pink roses, enhanced by a matching pink organza ruffled train at her hips. Roses also pop up on one ankle and serve as a flower crown atop her head. The look is very The Birth of Venus but make it fashion —and floral.Bieber let the roses be the centerpiece of her costume and kept her hair and makeup subtle and natural with radiant \"glazed\" skin, deep rose lips, and a hint of shimmery pink eye shadow, then finished off the costume with a pale pink and white manicure. She wore no jewelry or accessories other than her engagement diamond and a pair of pale pink ankle-strap sandals. While Casta wore the rose look with Raphaelite ringlet curls, Bieber decided on loose brunette waves for a more modern approach. I just have one question, Hailey: Are those real roses? Hopefully, you de-thorned them if so!Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Later on during Halloweekend, Bieber ditched the angelic florals of her first costume in favor of something darker: a \"Versace Vampire.\" The model donned a strappy black bustier top and high-waisted black skirt with a black and gold Versace logo belt, opera-length shiny black latex gloves, and a pair of vampire fangs for the Goth-inspired vampire moment. A black wig, bright purple eyeshadow, flushed cheeks, and blood-red lips (obviously), plus chunky gold necklaces and huge gold and pearl earrings added to the glamourous \\'90s Versace vibe; she could have walked right off a Gianni Versace runway, minus the fangs.Instagram/Hailey BieberThe two looks may have been complete opposites, but they paid homage to Bieber\\'s fashion roots in the most gorgeously spooky and stunning way.More celeb Halloween looks you may have missed:The Kardashian\\'s Halloween Costumes Included Mystique, Bride of Frankenstein and Jessie from Toy StoryYou Have to See Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly as Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee for HalloweenMegan Thee Stallion Has Outdone Herself in the Halloween Nail Art DepartmentMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNow, learn Hailey\\'s 10 biggest beauty tips:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'TikTok-turned-reality star Dixie D\\'Amelio finally committed to the hairstyle she\\'s been longing for since sixth grade.

You can find plenty of examples across social media. Just look to hashtags #tonguepiercing and #tonguepiercings on TikTok and Instagram, which have over 790 million views and 520,000 posts, respectively.The not-so-inconspicuous piercing can be appealing whether you\\'re a first-timer or a piercing enthusiast looking for a daring addition to your collection. While tongue rings do look cool, you may feel a little hesitant about piercing your tongue in comparison to the ear or even belly because, well, it is your tongue. The stakes seem higher and more dangerous should an infection occur.But despite the location, the aftercare for tongue piercings is actually a lot easier (and a lot less painful) than some would expect. Here\\'s everything you need to know before scheduling your piercing appointment, whether you\\'re undecided about taking the plunge or ready to get your tongue pierced tomorrow.Meet the experts:Jenna Myers, a piercer at Live By the Sword Tattoo in New York CityErich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone HealthLynn Loheide, a body piercer based in Nashville, TennesseeAre tongue piercings dangerous?Before you even think about setting up your appointment, it\\'s important to understand the risks associated with tongue piercings. Like any piercing, there\\'s always a possibility of infection or rejection.Sometimes the signs of infection can be easy to confuse with irritation in piercings, especially if you\\'re extra paranoid. But New York City-based piercer Jenna Myers says that there tends to be a pretty big distinction between the two.\"[With an] infection, your tongue is going to look absolutely wild,\" Myers shares. \"It\\'ll be two to three times the size, turning almost green or white, [with puss].\" When that happens, she always advises going to the ER for professional help. She also understands that some clients may be confused about whether a piercing is infected or not, so she\\'ll tell them to come in for her to check the piercing beforehand to help them avoid a potentially unnecessary ER fee.Erich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone Health, notes that pus, severe tongue swelling, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and difficult breathing indicate that it\\'s time to seek out a medical professional. Typically, infected piercings are usually treated with antibiotics and the removal of jewelry, he explains.But there are some rare cases where surgery might be needed to drain an abscess or deal with any other complications, according to Dr. Voigt. For example, he once had to perform an emergency surgery on a patient because their tongue started to fill with blood and swell, leading them to choke. \"Fortunately, I was able to take the person to the operating room, remove the piercing (which was difficult because half of it became incorporated into the swollen tongue), incise the tongue, tie off a bleeding artery and well as cauterize the muscles, and then suture the tongue back together,\" Dr. Voigt shares.Luckily, not every tongue piercing will become infected. Still, it\\'s important to note that regardless of placement, the piercing can cause damage to the teeth and gums, according to piercer Lynn Loheide and Dr. Voigt. \"You need to understand that going into it, be okay with that risk, and also know what you have to do to minimize that risk,\" Loheide shares.Are horizontal \"snake eyes\" tongue piercings safe?Speaking of placement, there are restrictions as to where the tongue piercing can go. You might have heard of snake eyes before. For those who are unfamiliar, this style typically refers to a horizontal tongue piercing at the tip of the tongue. And if you had hopes of getting that piercing, keep dreaming. Unfortunately, experts say that tongue piercings should only go vertically through the tongue because horizontal placement comes with a big risk of damage to the teeth and gum recession.\"When we\\'re piercing vertically, especially in the center, we\\'re piercing through a connective tissue between those muscles,\" Loheide explains. \"But when you\\'re piercing horizontally, you\\'re actually pinning those muscles together, and that can cause a lot of damage.\" They also note that in the state of Oregon, horizontal tongue piercings are banned for this reason.Can anyone get a tongue piercing?Though everyone\\'s tongue is different, Loheide says if your tongue is too short or you have a tongue-tie — which is basically when the webbing underneath your tongue comes almost or all the way to the tip — a tongue piercing is probably not the best option for you.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen you arrive at your appointment, don\\'t be surprised if the piercer starts analyzing your mouth. In fact, that\\'s a good sign because your unique anatomy will dictate where you can and can\\'t get pierced, and any reputable piercer will ensure to take that into account, Loheide shares.\"We want to see where the blood flow is along the underside of the tongue and make sure that we\\'re not too close to it,\" they explain. \"But we also want to look at the shape of someone\\'s teeth and someone\\'s mouth when we\\'re deciding placement.\" That way, a piercer can ensure that they aren\\'t causing unnecessary damage and that the jewelry won\\'t rub up uncomfortably against your teeth.What can I expect during a tongue piercing appointment?Before your appointment, it\\'s imperative that you brush your teeth and tongue before arriving. Myers shares that typically her clients are given mouthwash right before to help clean their mouths out.As mentioned above, most of your appointment will be spent on prepping and checking your tongue before the needle is inserted. The actual piercing part of the session is short, just like most other piercings — a hollow needle is pushed through the tongue, and then the piercer adds the jewelry, which is a barbell shape.For standard tongue piercings, the ring is usually in the center of the tongue. Though horizontal piercings are a big no-no, you can still get two vertical tongue piercings. Some may call them venom piercings, but Loheide prefers to just refer to them as paired tongue piercings because for some people venom refers to two horizontal piercings, and the slang terms used change over time.\"Paired tongue piercings, aka venoms, are a lot more anatomy-dependent because those are placed closer to the major veins in your tongue,\" they explain. \"So we have to make sure that there\\'s space around that blood flow for them to be placed safely.\"Like any piercing, you should expect pain, and though it\\'s subjective, Loheide and Myers both swear that a tongue piercing is not as bad as you might think. \"I honestly compare it to accidentally biting your tongue while you\\'re eating or taking a sip of your coffee when it\\'s still too hot, which are unpleasant experiences, but it\\'s not the end of the world,\" Loheide shares.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn fact, they say that the most uncomfortable part is having the piercer\\'s hands in your mouth for an extended amount of time. Myers notes that on a scale of one to 10, most of her clients rate standard tongue piercings between a one to three, and paired tongue piercings a three to five.What does aftercare for a tongue piercing look like?There are a few things to expect immediately after your piercing. If you\\'ve been pierced before, some of these won\\'t be too shocking, but there are certain effects that are specific to tongue piercings.Right after your appointment, expect your tongue to be a bit swollen and painful for about one to two weeks, according to Loheide. That\\'s naturally going to happen because the piercing is a fresh wound. In addition to the pain and swelling, you\\'ll also deal with a slight lisp or change in how you speak. \"After about a week, the swelling will go down, and then the rest of the healing process is pretty easy,\" they share.Myers estimates that for a single tongue piercing, it will take about one to three months and three to five for paired piercings. \"Because the tongue is so vascular, it has a lot of blood flow to it, so it heals really quickly,\" she says. On the other hand, Loheide says to expect it to take about three to five months to be fully healed.Thankfully, the aftercare for tongue piercings isn\\'t too complicated. In general, maintaining good oral hygiene — brushing your teeth regularly and flossing — is important. Once you get home, Loheide recommends immediately changing out your toothbrush for a new one and using milder oral hygiene products. They advise avoiding toothpaste with whitening ingredients.Both piercers strongly suggest using an alcohol-free mouthwash that won\\'t burn your mouth. Loheide likes Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse because it doesn\\'t taste as badly as some alcohol-free mouthwashes do, it\\'s affordable, and can be found in most drug stores. Myers also recommends sterile saline solution, which tends to be recommended for most piercings.Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse$10Apart from switching up your oral products, you may have to change what you eat, but only for a short while. Myers suggests avoiding spicy, crunchy, and acidic foods in the first few weeks to avoid irritation. \"Things that you wouldn\\'t [want on] a paper cut, basically, you don\\'t want to eat the first few weeks of a tongue piercing, because it will cause serious discomfort,\" she says.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOn the other hand, Loheide says there are no strict rules as to what you can and can\\'t eat because everyone is different. But you still have to be mindful of how your mouth and tongue feel when you do eat or drink certain things. \"If you go to eat something and you\\'re like, \\'Wow, this feels terrible to eat,\\' don\\'t keep eating it,\" they share.Ultimately, try to not go overboard with your piercing aftercare, because that could potentially case more irritation. \"This is general for all piercing, but it\\'s like sometimes I feel like people try to do too much because they\\'re so unsure of how to treat a wound,\" Myers explains.\" Being as simple as possible with your aftercare is really best. Your body is really good at healing itself.\"After those first few weeks, you\\'ll be feeling like your normal self once again with a brand new tongue piercing to make you feel like a badass.Read more stories about piercings:7 Piercing Trends That Will Be Everywhere in 2022How to Remove Every Kind of Piercing Jewelry at HomeIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?Now enjoy the unboxing of the April 2022 Allure Beauty Box:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'Doja Cat is ready to travel to a galaxy far, far away.

Popularized in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, the timing for this resurgence makes sense: We\\'re already sticking Y2K-inspired rhinestones on our faces, breaking out the frosted eye shadow, and revisiting \"thong jeans\" so low-rise they would make even Paris Hilton blush. It was only a matter of time before bonding Swarovski crystal butterflies to our enamel made a comeback, too.Dental bling may be one of this year\\'s biggest beauty trends, but it\\'s nothing new. Anthropological records show that dentists as far back as the Mayan Empire decorated teeth with jade, gold, and turquoise, according to Anjali Rajpal, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California, nicknamed \"The Diamond Dentist\" on account of the bejeweled designs she creates for her celebrity clientele.Tooth jewelry also has significance in Black culture — a well-known example is grills, which were first worn by West Indian immigrants in the \\'70s and \\'90s hip-hop artists. Grills are decorative covers made of gold, silver, or encrusted with jewels that snap over one or more teeth and are removed at the end of each day. Tooth gems as we know them today differ from grills, but it\\'s important to recognize the cultures they\\'re derived from.Instead of a mouthful of precious metal, tooth gems are usually a single or a few delicate multi-colored gems or diamonds that are bonded individually to the teeth. Pinterest is clearly here for the trend, with the site reporting an 85 percent uptick in searches for \"tooth gems\" last year alone, while TikTok views for the hashtag #toothgems currently stand at 130.4m. \"Tooth gems add a little edge to someone\\'s style and are a less invasive way to make a statement than a tattoo,\" Dr. Rajpal tells Allure.Aesthetics aside, what about the dental health implications of these tiny adornments? We asked experts to share how tooth gems can be applied, and cared for, safely.Meet the Experts:Anjali Rajpal, DMD, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California.Michael Apa, DDS, an aesthetic dentist in New York City.Brian Kantor, DDS, a cosmetic dentist in New York City.How are tooth gems applied?Everyone\\'s bite is different, so there\\'s no avoiding a consultation first – sorry, dentist\\'s orders. \"[A consultation appointment] is also an opportunity to take my client\\'s style and personality into account when collaborating with them for their jewelry design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.If you\\'re choosing a semi-permanent tooth gem, no drilling is required: The technique is similar to the way braces are applied. \"An acidic solution (or etching gel) is placed on the tooth\\'s surface, microscopically roughening the enamel, before the gemstone is bonded to it with an adhesive and curing lamp,\" explains New York City-based aesthetic dentist Michael Apa. The whole process only takes a matter of minutes and is painless, provided the gem is bonded to the surface of a healthy tooth, Dr. Apa says. \"If you\\'ve got worn-away enamel from grinding your teeth or eating too many acidic foods, there will likely be sensitivity,\" he adds.Permanent tooth gems do require drilling a hole in the desired location, so be ready for the commitment if you\\'re planning on getting this adornment because it won\\'t be easy to remove. Also worth noting: While tooth gems can be bonded to veneers, Dr. Apa says they can\\'t be worn with Invisalign.How much do tooth gems cost?There\\'s no one-size-fits-all price tag. The cost will largely depend on your choice of design and materials (a Swarovski crystal, for example, will be cheaper than a diamond). Some dentists charge two separate fees – one for the gemstone and another for the application. \"My in-office fees include both and can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the size, quality, and quantity of the stones and the nature of the design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.How long do tooth gems last?Most tooth gems are semi-permanent and can last anywhere between six months to one year, says Brian Kantor, a cosmetic dentist in New York City. The right aftercare and dental materials used to bond the gemstone to the tooth will help you get the most out of your new dental jewelry.\"For the first 24 hours after getting a tooth gem, you should only eat soft foods and avoid using an electric toothbrush or drinking soda, coffee, or tea to protect the fresh bond,\" says Dr. Kantor, adding that picking or playing with your tooth gem is also off-limits. Sometimes a tooth gem may fall off on its own if you bite down hard on something, but Dr. Kantor says not to worry: \"There\\'s no harm to your tooth if that happens and the gem can simply be re-attached.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSemi-permanent tooth gems can also be safely removed by a dentist if you change your mind or want to switch up the design. “The gem is simply polished off along with any adhesive on the tooth,\" says Dr. Rajpal. As for permanent tooth gems, though, be warned that removing a permanent tooth gem that was inserted into a tooth will leave a hole. \"This hole will then need to be filled in with a white filling material that is color-matched to the existing shade of the tooth,\" adds Dr. Rajpal.Are tooth gems safe?If you ask Dr. Apa, tooth gems are purely an accessory. \"They\\'re a very specific aesthetic choice because they don\\'t offer the restorative benefits that come with veneers or crowns,\" he says. On top of not offering any benefits, there are a few dental risks that come with getting a set of gems.\"Tooth gems can trap plaque and create places for stray food particles and harmful bacteria to hide,\" Dr. Kantor explains. Needless to say, keeping the gem clean and practicing good oral hygiene is essential if you want to avoid gum inflammation, decay, or other dental issues. Alongside regular flossing, Dr. Apa recommends brushing twice a day with a non-abrasive toothpaste and soft bristle sonic toothbrush \"because the vibration offers a deeper clean and dislodges food stuck to the gemstone,\" he says.The bottom line? In general, as long as a dentist applies your chosen gem, and you\\'re taking proper care of your teeth at home, \"the risks are minimal,\" Dr. Apa says. In the wrong hands, he warns you could end up getting a gem with a rough surface that can cause traumatic lesions on the inside of the lip. \"Or if the gem isn\\'t placed properly, you can break an opposing tooth when you bite down,\" he cautions.So, I shouldn\\'t try applying tooth gems at home?Nope! Advice from dentists hasn\\'t stopped folks from taking the DIY route with nail art gems and superglue, but it should. \"It sounds obvious, but nobody should be ingesting toxic glue,\" insists Dr. Rajpal, who prefers to work with biocompatible materials such as gold and precious or semiprecious stones. \"Besides, glue doesn\\'t properly bond the gem to the tooth structure as well as dental materials,\" she explains. \"It\\'s far safer for a tooth gem to be applied by an experienced dentist, using a non-toxic material and polished to avoid any bacterial traps, as it will last longer, be more comfortable and hygienic.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesFor the same reason, Dr. Apa recommends a dentist remove the gem to avoid accidentally stripping away healthy enamel or tooth structure. \"You shouldn\\'t DIY anything in dentistry,\" he says. \"Tooth gem application is a dental procedure, and all procedures should be performed by a professional.\"More stories to take a bite into:I Took on Credit Card Debt to Get Braces as an AdultDentists Reveal the Correct Order to Brush Your Teeth, Floss, and Use MouthwashHow to Deal With Teeth Grinding and Jaw ClenchingNow, see how dental care has evolved over the last 100 years:', 'The 2022 MTV VMAs have barely even begun, and Lizzo is already stealing the show. The \"About Damn Time\" singer arrived at the awards show in an ensemble that was almost as dark as the black carpet she walked on. She looked like she could be princess of the underworld or even a gothic cake topper with her massive navy blue gown, dark lipstick, and golden rings on her ears, fingers, and lips.Where do you even start with a look like this? The singer\\'s navy blue gown was a gorgeous rumpled, off-the-shoulder dress from Jean Paul Gaultier. She paired it with sheer navy blue gloves that covered her forearms.Her golden jewelry was as excessive as her stunning gown in all the best ways possible. On both of her ring fingers, she wore an abstract looped ring. Earrings of various sizes covered her entire cartilage and lobe. The rings along her cartilage were thicker in width but smaller in circumference, so they hugged her ear. The hoops on the lobe were much larger, nearly skimming her shoulders. The last ring lay in the middle of her bottom lip.Getty ImagesThe lip ring combined with the dark blue lipstick and slicked back, wet-looking hair gave this look an edgier vibe that fit right in at the VMAs. Makeup artist Alexx Mayo was responsible for this glam makeup and matte lip. He painted her lips with Charlotte Tilbury\\'s Rock N Kohl liner in Bedroom Black and Eye Colour Magic Liner Duo in Super Blue to create the deep navy blue hue.Hairstylist Shelby Swain, who often works with the pop star, gave Lizzo\\'s wig the wet look using Matrix\\'s Instacure Anti-Breakage Porosity Spray and Vavooom Extra Full Freezing Spray. For the simple baby hairs, Swain used Matrix\\'s Overachiever Paste 3-in-1 Cream to keep the swoops in place.It was hard to see her nails beneath her mesh gloves, but the almond-shaped claws were painted with silver nail polish by nail artist Eri Ishizu. She used OPI\\'s GelColor in Clean State as a base before adding Chrome Effects in Mixed Metals to create an iridescent finish. Those two products are exclusive to nail artist pros, but OPI\\'s Nail Lacquer in Clean Slate and Infinite Shine in Silver on Ice work as replacements.Getty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf this was just her arrival look, we can\\'t wait for what she\\'s going to be wearing on stage when she performs.

The Emily in Paris star may be called \"classic\" or \"glamorous,\" but the actor rarely ventures into the unconventional. And you could argue the same thing about luxury brand Cartier. But apparently, when the two get together, the trendy, off-beat coolness comes out — a Collins\\'s hair is proof.In the new ad campaign for Clash de Cartier, a jewelry collection that strikes a balance between classic and eccentric, Collins does exactly that. We see her in an elegant, asymmetrical black dress and red lipstick, and her brown hair is pulled back into a sleek, low bun, not unlike the style she wore for her wedding — basically exactly how we picture Lily Collins when we picture Lilly Collins.As Billy Idol\\'s \"Dancing With Myself\" plays, she stands in contrast with another version of herself that looks completely out of her beauty comfort zone, yet it somehow works so well.

Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.On Tuesday, Collins teased a preview of the look, giving us a peek at the baby bangs, which appear to have been styled by Gregory Russell. The makeup looks were done by Fiona Stiles, and the manicures by nail artist Thuy Nguyen.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Although Collins recently told us that her curtain bangs are a \"dedicated decision\" that she\\'s wanted to do \"for years but never had the courage to take the plunge,\" it looks like she may be open to trying other, unexpected fringe looks.

Her 29th birthday look has all the elements that define her signature style: inches and inches of hair, super long acrylic nails, and lots of bling.She posted a few photos of the gorgeous birthday look to Instagram on July 4, showing off her mile-long curls nearly as white as snow, pastel purple eye makeup, and baby blue nail design full of iridescent gems. She is seen in a cutout purple dress with her platinum blonde curls cascading over one of her shoulders, the ends almost grazing her knees. Though she tends to switch up her hair color often, she\\'s indulged in her blonde era many times before with this bright hue, just like when she chopped off her hair into a platinum-blonde buzz cut right at the end of 2021.The light hair color pairs beautifully with her lavender cut crease, which also complements her gown perfectly. You\\'d think the light purple shade would also make an appearance on her nails, but not at all. Instead, this stiletto manicure was painted a light blue hue, which feels like an apt choice for the water sign. Each icy blue nail was filled with opalescent jewels of various sizes running straight down the middle.

On the 2022 red carpet, it has come in the form of elaborate headpieces, an overwhelming amount of black attire for a white-tie event, and some very funky hairstyles — especially including that of Alicia Keys.Keys walked the red carpet on May 2 in a black gown, completed by a cape bedazzled with the New York City skyline (how fitting for the singer who wrote the concrete-jungle-wet-dream-tomato song). When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection. When is it not?Getty ImagesThen I caught a look at her long braid from the side and the back and now I'm bewildered by… whatever is in her hair. As you can see below, Keys's braid is — I don't even know what word to use here — woven? Woven with something I'm finding very hard to describe. It's like a black-and-silver ribbon… made out of CDs… bedazzled CDs?Getty ImagesIn short, I have no idea what is going on with this hairstyle or what to call it, but it looks damn good. Then again, Alicia Keys could've rocked up to the Met Gala in a garbage can and she still would've made it look soulfully chic. It's what she does best.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King's Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNeed more?

On the 2022 red carpet, it has come in the form of elaborate headpieces, an overwhelming amount of black attire for a white-tie event, and some very funky hairstyles — especially including that of Alicia Keys.Keys walked the red carpet on May 2 in a black gown, completed by a cape bedazzled with the New York City skyline (how fitting for the singer who wrote the concrete-jungle-wet-dream-tomato song). When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection. When is it not?Getty ImagesThen I caught a look at her long braid from the side and the back and now I'm bewildered by… whatever is in her hair. As you can see below, Keys's braid is — I don't even know what word to use here — woven? Woven with something I'm finding very hard to describe. It's like a black-and-silver ribbon… made out of CDs… bedazzled CDs?Getty ImagesIn short, I have no idea what is going on with this hairstyle or what to call it, but it looks damn good. Then again, Alicia Keys could've rocked up to the Met Gala in a garbage can and she still would've made it look soulfully chic. It's what she does best.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King's Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNeed more?

But, what if I told you there\\'s another radiance-intensifying ingredient that\\'s also a staple in your jewelry box? That\\'s right, I\\'m talking about gold, which is one of the many luminosity-amplifying ingredients in 111Skin\\'s Rose Gold Radiance Booster.111Skin is no stranger to luxury beauty: the brand has started gaining some serious hype from celebs like Kesha and it\\'s become a repeat feature in the Allure Beauty Box for its impressive, skin-nourishing formulations. Even our very own associate features director Dianna Mazzone is a fan of the brand, particularly 111Skin\\'s Vitamin C Brightening Booster. So, I already knew I was in good hands when this fancy-schmancy rose gold bottle first landed on my desk.Courtesy of brandImmediately, I did a quick scan of the label to see if my sensitive, rosacea-stricken skin could handle the formula. The serum contains a few ingredients that are already in my skin-care regimen: hydrating hyaluronic acid, brightening niacinamide, and soothing rosewater. \"The best known effect of rosewater is being anti-inflammatory, which can reduce redness and swelling in the skin,\" Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist James Wang, MD, says of the latter ingredient. \"The hydrating and antibacterial benefits, combined with its ability to calm the skin, can be especially helpful in some patients with inflammatory acne and rosacea.\"But what made me raise my eyebrows in skepticism was the pure gold extract. This may seem like a gimmicky ingredient, but Dr. Wang says that this precious metal can actually have a purpose in your skin-care routine. He notes that gold actually is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and claims of targeting fine lines and wrinkles. \"Although not a fully proven effect, gold is thought to help with wrinkles and signs of sun damage by also boosting collagen production,\" he says. With all of this in mind, Dr. Wang says this ingredient can be irritating to sensitive skin or those allergic to gold, so always patch test this product before applying it to your face.According to the bottle\\'s directions, there are two ways you can use this product: alone after cleansing or mixed into your favorite moisturizer. Whichever path you choose, the brand recommends using one to two drops. I decided to try both avenues of application simply out of curiosity and I\\'ve found that its slippery formula absorbs equally as well, regardless of how you apply it.As for its texture, the Rose Gold Radiance Booster is shimmery and has a slippery feel to it, almost like a champagne-hued version of a snail mucin serum. Once I applied it to my skin, the first thing I noticed was how teensy the gold particles were, which didn\\'t irritate my skin at all. It left a reflective veil of natural-looking shimmer without looking too intense or dramatic, and because of this, I\\'ve been reserving this sparkly serum for my morning skin-care regimen.Jennifer Hussein for AllureSo, is this gold-infused serum really worth the triple-digit price tag? Considering the fact that I\\'ve been using it daily for two months and have seen a major difference in the radiance of my complexion, my answer is a million times over, absolutely. Sure, there are many brightening skin-care products on the market, but as someone who\\'s tested hundreds of these formulations, 111Skin\\'s iridescent serum provided significant results that I haven\\'t achieved with other picks. And, at the very least, it\\'s literally liquid gold for your face, so why not treat yourself to a little luxury?111Skin Rose Gold Radiance Booster$135Want to try it for yourself?

Each design I create is a reflection of who I am.\"Short Nail Art InspirationGrowing up in Texas with family from Mexico City, Goldstein has had a wide variety of influences on her nail designs, the biggest of which was museum art. She developed an appreciation of the techniques of Diego Rivera, the Mexican painter who became Frida Kahlo\\'s husband, the color palette combinations of Josef Albers, the German artist who was the first to get solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art and the Met in New York, and the styles of her grandparents\\' house in Mexico City, which was designed by Architect Luis Barragán.\"I believe Barragán\\'s work is a study of the language of the colors of México,\" she says. \"Being surrounded by a wide palette definitely shaped my understanding of the interplay between colors and how colors affect emotions, which has impacted my designs greatly.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.When it comes to creating designs now, Goldstein uses her own style and life as inspiration. Because she uses her hands for work —through manicures and jewelry design (did we mention she owns two brands, Doublemoss Jewelry and Doublemoss Arte?) —she found that short nails are the most functional.How to Shape Short NailsGoldstein explains that shaping has the biggest impact on creating the illusion of longer nails. She\\'s a big fan of the tapered oval and square shapes but recommends avoiding flat square nails because they can make your nails look shorter. In terms of trends, every design can look good on short nails, Goldstein says, citing French tips and negative space nails as examples, but it\\'s the way the design is styled that matters.\"If you do a thick, flat French tip, it makes your short nail look shorter,\" she says, opposed to a daintier, more curved tip. \"Negative space nails work wonders for shorter nails. A clean sheer base helps minimize the attention on the nail and focus on the art.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Celebrities Who Love Short NailsWhen navigating designs with clients, Goldstein\\'s biggest goal is to make sure the nails complement the entire look, especially when doing celebrity nails for red carpet events (her résumé includes several Met Galas, U.S. press for The Batman, and The Academy of Motion Pictures Museum Opening Gala, but no big deal).Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I never want the nail art to take over,\" she says. \"Nail art is not for everyone, and I like to respect that by never pushing it on any of my clients.\"Goldstein also enjoys how collaborative the nail art process can be, naming her method with Gemma Chan, whose nails she did for the Met Gala in 2019 and 2021 and The Eternals premiere in London, as an example.\"I create a design based on what she is wearing and then consult Gemma for any tweaks or changes,\" she says. \"I love that Gemma isn\\'t scared to take risks with nails and respects the art.\"Goldstein is making major strides in bringing short nails back, and we\\'re obsessed with all of her designs. To sum it all up, we\\'d say she\\'s nailing it.

To be real, anything \"boiling over\" on our face is something we\\'d like to avoid.According to the National Eczema Association, 31.6 million people in the U.S. have some form of eczema, making it one of the most common skin conditions. If you\\'re experiencing red, irritated skin on your face (especially your eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, or chin), there\\'s a fairly good chance it\\'s facial eczema. You may already have it elsewhere on your body, or it could be on your face alone. And while there is no study evaluating the prevalence of facial eczema, specifically, New York City-based dermatologist Neil Sadick, MD, says he believes the disorder affects about a third of the population.With facial eczema, you\\'ll have to do a bit of detective work to identify what\\'s causing it. There are a few types — atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis being the two most common forms — and they act a little differently. Some types will resolve in a few weeks with treatment, while other cases are chronic and need constant management. But you\\'re not alone. There are solutions as well as ways to keep it under control.Facial eczema can be itchy, flaky, and frustrating — your face is usually the first thing people see — and with so many types of eczema to parse through, it can be overwhelming. To help, we spoke with several board-certified dermatologists to find out what exactly constitutes facial eczema, what triggers the condition, and most importantly, how to keep symptoms at bay.Meet the experts:Macrene Alexiades, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center of New York in New York City.Hadley King, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Anthony Rossi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Neil Sadick, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Adam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C.Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Read MoreBody & Mind GuideSymptoms, treatment options, and personal experiences for various physical, mental, and health conditions and concerns.ArrowIn this story:What Is Facial Eczema?Causes of Facial EczemaHow to Prevent Facial EczemaHow to Treat Facial EczemaShould I Treat Facial Eczema Differently Than I Would Eczema on My Body?What Should I Do if Over-The-Counter Products Aren\\'t Cutting It?What Is Facial Eczema?\"Eczema is an inflammation of the skin caused by either an allergen or irritant,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Anthony Rossi, MD. It can also be genetic, and triggered by irritants.Facial eczema has many different symptoms that can manifest themselves differently from person to person, but some common things to look for are red patches, itchy skin, stinging, and dryness. With darker skin tones, it also tends to be scaly, says Dr. Rossi.Eczema is a common condition that can appear anywhere on the body, but if you\\'re grappling with facial eczema, it\\'s likely on the eyelids, eyebrows, cheeks, or chin. And while it is common, you definitely should bring it to your dermatologist. \"Eczema that develops near the eyes needs special attention because the eyes themselves can be affected,\" adds Dr. Alexiades. \"Those with eczema around the eyes are more susceptible to certain eye problems such as conjunctivitis, inflamed cornea, and changes in the shape of the cornea, a condition called keratoconus.\"Causes of Facial EczemaThere are a few different types of facial eczema — which will be key in not just identifying what you\\'re dealing with, but how you treat it. The most common type of facial eczema is atopic dermatitis. \"Atopic dermatitis is genetic and flares can be triggered by dry environmental conditions, not moisturizing, stress, and allergies,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Hadley King, MD.The second type is contact dermatitis, which comes from exposure to an irritating substance or something you may be allergic to (common perpetrators are cosmetics, dyes, soaps, detergents, fragrance, or smoke — in addition to environmental allergens like pet dander or pollen). \"Some people break out in an eczema rash after eating certain foods, such as nuts, shellfish, milk, and eggs,\" says Dr. Alexiades.Try to note when you see an eczema flare and note any common denominators to your dermatologist. This should help both you and your dermatologist narrow it down and get to the root cause.How to Prevent Facial EczemaThe best way to prevent eczema on the face is the most obvious but perhaps the most important method: identify the trigger and remove it. \"For example, if you notice red patches when you wear jewelry, you may be allergic to nickel. Stop wearing jewelry and your eczema may go away,\" says Dr. Alexiades. \"If you notice red itchy patches after a night out, it may be perfume that is your trigger, in which case stop wearing fragrances and look for fragrance-free cosmetics.\"The same goes for cosmetics and skincare. \"Know what’s in your skincare and if you’re prone to allergies,\" says Dr. Rossi. It may be beneficial to go on a \"product diet.\" Pare down your routine to one gentle product (a cleanser is a good place to start) and add them back in slowly, one by one, to see if you can identify which product is causing your facial eczema. Patch testing—applying a small amount of a product to the sensitive skin on the inside of the arm to see if there is a reaction within 24 hours—can also help to narrow things down.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf you find that your flare-ups happen when you\\'re stressed, you may need to identify some lifestyle changes like taking on fewer projects, getting more rest, or finding more time for mindfulness. Likewise, if you notice that your facial eczema gets worse in dry or hot weather, try to plan ahead for AC breaks, come prepared with sunscreen, and find a thicker and more reliable moisturizer that can hang on all day.How to Treat Facial EczemaSometimes, simply removing your facial eczema triggers will totally cure your skin within weeks. But if your facial eczema is very severe and you can\\'t identify any bad actors, you may want to try over-the-counter hydrocortisone or get a topical steroid prescription from your dermatologist. \"A topical corticosteroid cream will help treat any of the causes of facial eczema,\" says Dr. King. “Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects.” They can be used as needed to treat flares but not for ongoing maintenance, according to the National Eczema Association, since prolonged use can cause withdrawal side effects like red, irritated skin and pimple-like papules.Dr. Rossi adds that antihistamines can be an effective short-term solution if the eczema is caused by an allergen. Otherwise, \"there are more systemic medications for severe or widespread cases,\" he says.How to Curb Flare-upsNot all types of eczema have a surefire \"cure,\" but you can definitely make it more manageable and lessen your flare-ups. You may be able to curb irritation with good lifestyle habits, over-the-counter products, and consistent skincare with gentle but moisturizing products.\"Good, gentle care of your skin is the most important aspect of treating facial eczema,\" says Dr. Alexiades, who recommends fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products if you find that you’re prone to flare-ups. \"Consider a mild cleanser and wash your face with lukewarm water, since heat can cause a flare-up.\"Dr. Alexiades also touts the benefits of keeping your skin hydrated. She recommends moisturizers with emollient ingredients like ceramides and cosmetics that also have moisturizing ingredients. \"Having facial eczema doesn’t mean you can never wear makeup, but not all products are the same,\" she says. \"Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and shea butter.\" Moisturizers and cosmetics with moisturizing ingredients (like hyaluronic acid and shea butter) can help to protect the outer skin barrier—which can be damaged or compromised by eczema, according to the National Eczema Association.Should I treat facial eczema differently than I would eczema on my body?Yes. Both Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, and Dr. Sadick recommend using milder products on your face because the skin is thinner and more sensitive than the skin on your body. \"I would use eczema skin-care products designed for face and body respectively as they contain different concentrations of active ingredients,\" says Dr. Sadick.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesAdam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., recommends using weaker topical steroids, as he says, \"facial skin is more sensitive to the skin thinning and lightening effect of topical steroids.\" According to a study by the National Eczema Association, prolonged use of strong topical steroids can cause a host of withdrawal symptoms once you stop using the cream—like burning, stinging, papules, or pimple-like bumps. However, short-term use is safe and effective with the guidance of a dermatologist.What should I do if over-the-counter products aren\\'t cutting it?Sadly, sometimes eczema on the face can prove extremely stubborn to the point where treatment may need to be prescribed by a doctor. \"If home treatments are not helping, you may need prescription medications,\" says Dr. Shah. \"I usually prescribe either a topical steroid or a topical calcineurin inhibitor, a non-steroidal medication that can reduce inflammation and treat eczema.\"Dr. Shah says she sometimes prescribes special moisturizers called barrier repair creams for patients. And if the eczema is severe and not responding to topical treatments, other options include phototherapy, aka light therapy. There\\'s a wide range of treatment options for facial eczema, so it often comes down to trial and error in order to figure out what works for you. We\\'d recommend always consulting your dermatologist before trying anything new.Read more about caring for skin conditions:6 Skin-Care Ingredients to Add to Your Routine If You Have EczemaHow to Treat Scalp Eczema, According to DermatologistsWhy Colloidal Oatmeal Should Be Part of Your Skin-Care RegimenYou can follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on all things beauty.', 'The 2022 Met Gala is here and back on the first Monday of May. This year, celebrities were challenged with the theme, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion,\" with an emphasis on gilded glamour. Tonight, stars are showing how they\\'re channeling the essence of the Gilded Age with black gowns, lengthy nails, and extravagant headpieces.The vintage waves and slicked-back chignons may be nice, but headpieces are the star of the show at this year\\'s version of the fashion event — and rightfully so. Simple headwear like bedazzled tiaras and golden headbands made their appearance alongside elaborate fascinators and massive hats. It\\'s clear that head coverings are key to the gilded glamour theme, and here are some of our favorite ones.Flaming DiscsGetty ImagesLa La Anthony arrived earlier in the night in a burgundy two-piece with a swirly manicure and a large red headpiece that captured our attention. On one side, there\\'s a large circular piece with red ovular pieces woven together. But, on the other side, the headpiece looks completely different — large and small candy apple-red roses shine, bringing this all-over red ensemble together.Hint of PinkGetty ImagesSarah Jessica Parker took our breaths away and clearly understood the gilded glamour assignment with her black-and-white Christopher John Roberts gown and detailed fascinator. This black netted piece covers part of her face, but it gets even better as your eyes travel up. Rolled pieces of black mesh pop out at the top alongside numerous strings with tiny diamond pieces in black and white. The fuchsia flower and leaves add a touch of color to this look that just makes sense.Abstract HaloGetty ImagesWinnie Harlow stepped on the carpet in a short abstract white dress topped with an intricate white-and-golden headpiece that we can\\'t quite describe. There\\'s thin golden rods that flow from the back of her head connecting to the clear-and-white, sharp abstract pieces that curl out from the sides of her head. This piece almost reminds us of the legs of an insect.Covered in SilverGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThis is far from the first headpiece Janelle Monáe has worn on the red carpet, and it won\\'t be the last one we ooooh and ahhhh over. The black-and-silver, striped hood connects to her bedazzled gown, which is the same color, and covers her entire head. It\\'s the epitome of glamour and excellence.Tiny TiarasGetty ImagesEmma Chamberlain was in the salon for hours the day before the Met Gala to achieve this light platinum blonde hair. Her blunt bob was parted down the middle and tucked behind her ears with a silver bedazzled tiara. This tiara isn\\'t in-your-face, but the delicate piece matches her studded accessories well.Pieces of GoldGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesTommy Dorfman made a statement with her hunter green, latex dress with black leather gloves. The small golden headband on her head complements the gold pieces on her cut-out dress. Tiny squarish shapes are all over the top of the headband.Birds of a Feather Getty ImagesQuannah Chasinghorse always brings her culture wherever she goes. For the Met Gala, she paired a large feather headpiece with a voluminous, baby blue tulle dress. The feathers were attached to intricate braids on one side of her head and look stunning with her jewelry.Bathed in WhiteGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesCynthia Erivo\\'s towering white headwrap references the Tignon Laws, which was a law in the late 1800s that forced Black women to cover their hair. The white wrap is also an ode to the many types of headwraps Black women wear around the globe. We\\'re loving the height and volume of this chalk-white headpiece.Wide BrimsGetty ImagesSZA was clearly embracing the saying \"go big or go home,\" with her hot pink gown, a massive black hat, and latex gloves and thigh-high boots. The sheer size of this hat was impressive, and we would love to know if it stayed put the whole night or if she had to take it off to avoid accidentally hitting someone. At the back of the hat is a fuzzy boa that reached below the singer\\'s waist.Sequins GaloreGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSequins and gems had a huge moment at the 2022 Met Gala. Jessica Chastain decided to shine in a long-sleeve, garnet gown with a silver snake that wrapped around the dress. She paired the look with a turban headband in the same red sequins as the dress for a matchy-matchy moment. The hair accessory also has a silver element with a jeweled brooch at the very center of her head — it\\'s lavish, glitzy, and flashy, which is apt for the glamourous theme.Netted VisionGetty ImagesClaire Danes\\'s slicked-back bob was accessorized with a black fascinator that covered most of her face and ears. This netted design was on the simpler side and almost looked like a bunch of small soda plastic rings woven together.One KnotGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesLily Aldridge is another celebrity who matched her entire outfit from head to toe. Her gown, gloves, and headscarf all had the same silver-studded black design. The bejeweled scarf was tied simply right below her neck for a chic but simple look.Golden GloryGetty ImagesNatasha Poonawalla did not skimp out on any gold on the red carpet. Her brown gown was covered in sequins and accessorized with several large gold pieces of jewelry. She even added a golden headband full of multicolored jewels in different sizes. But the main attraction was the golden corset-like piece that extends into a large headpiece. Three thin metal pieces formed a trio of circles around her head and neck, covering a portion of her face. Shorter pieces of gold curl outward on the rings matched the swirly metal on her chest area.With a TiltGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNormani arrived in a velvet black two-piece set with a brand new hair color.

On June 15, the icon announced that her seventh album, titled Renaissance, is dropping on July 29. Even though she alerted her fans of the upcoming music a month in advance — a striking difference from when she released her self-titled album in 2013 without any promotion — she still made sure to keep us on our toes by sharing the exciting news in the middle of the night and appearing on the July cover of British Vogue just a few hours later.This cover is nothing short of magnificent — and the Beyhive agrees. The \"Spirit\" singer looks like royalty sitting on top of a horse in an all-black Maison Alaia gown with a massive feather headpiece. The rest of the photo shoot is just as breathtaking and extravagant. In one image, she appears in another black outfit but with a leather jacket, black box braids that hairstylist Jawara twisted into what looks like Bantu knots, and a glossy black lip, painted by her longtime makeup artist, Sir John. She looks like the baddest person to ever live sitting on top of a motorcycle instead of a horse.The hair and headpieces were clearly a focal priority in this shoot. They are striking, futuristic, and risky. In a few photos, she has dark hair instead of her usual blonde-highlighted strands, which is making some fans wonder if Queen Bey will be returning to her brunette era for this new album.Getty ImagesBut there is one other hairstyle that is sparking some strong reactions from the Beyhive. The hairstyle in question is the choppy baby fringe she wears with a gilded Schiaparelli Haute Couture outfit and jewelry. These short bangs are far from Beyonce\\'s norm and took several Twitter fans back to 2014, one of the few other times we have seen her with baby bangs.If you don\\'t remember that fringe, let me jog your memory for a second — they were thick, very blunt, and super short, stopping several inches about her forehead. She wore similar bangs in her \\'60s-inspired music video for \"Why Don\\'t You Love Me,\" which was released four years prior. She also had a pair of those stubby bangs in a brunette shade in her \"Telephone\" music video with pop star Lady Gaga.screenshot of Beyoncé from “Telephone” video\\nCourtesy of UMG/InterscopeA few fans noted how the resurgence of these bangs indicated that the Houston singer\\'s upcoming music is about to be epic.One user tweeted side-by-side photos of the spiky bangs and her baby fringe from 2014 and, \"Beyoncé is NOT playing she brought the choppy bangs out.\" Another fan compared the two photos and commented, \"Beyoncé even resurrected the chopped and screwed bangs.

Another jokingly noted that the fringe was probably styled by one of her five-year-old twins. \"I love that Beyoncé always includes her kids in her work, the fact that she got rumi and sir to cut her bangs/style her hair,\" the tweet reads.Regardless of your feelings about the baby fringe, we\\'re sure you\\'re more than excited for the upcoming album — we definitely are. Some fans are thinking it\\'s going to include disco and house influences due to rumors about artists she is collaborating with and the overall vibe of the shoot; it blends retro elements, such as a giant disco ball and platform boots, and futuristic designs. We won\\'t fully know until July 29, but we\\'re sure that Beyoncé will deliver hits as she always has.Read more stories about bangs:21 Types of Bangs to Consider If You\\'re Ready to Take the PlungeBottleneck Bangs Are the New, Daintier Take on Curtain BangsYour Guide to Styling, Maintaining, and Growing Out Curtain BangsNow enjoy this pro-dancers entire daily routine:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'In our humble opinion, nothing beats the rush of getting a needle poked through your skin for a piercing. Among the various ways to express yourself through body modification, they\\'re relatively low risk and just plain ol\\' fun.Piercing trends tend to ebb and flow. Some locations, like the ear lobe, seemingly never go out of style while other placements, like the belly button, resurge in popularity every few years or so. The COVID-19 pandemic affected many folks\\' ability to get piercings as mask-covered areas became off-limits. But, as tattoo and piercing shops open back up, more people have been willing to experiment, whether it\\'s by adding new jewelry to old holes or getting something entirely new.We chatted with a few piercers to learn about all the ear and body piercing trends you should expect in the new year. Here are the piercing trends you\\'ll be seeing everywhere in 2022.Ear CurationsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyThe ear is a popular site for piercings, but recently more folks are seeking out ear curations, according to piercer Amber Maysonet who works at Live by the Sword Tattoo. \"It\\'s basically a mapping and planning for either now or future piercings for your ears,\" she explains. Ear curations involve giving the piercer the creative freedom to choose multiple piercings for you while taking into account your aesthetic and your ear\\'s anatomy to figure out the best placements and jewelry. Sometimes these curations also involve adding new jewelry to already existing piercings to ensure everything works together.Maysonet cites social media, especially TikTok, as the reason why she thinks more people are choosing these curations. \"When you look at [these piercings], especially on social media, you see how good everything goes together and how nice [they] look on somebody else, obviously you\\'re like, \\'OMG, I can do that,\\'\" she shares.At Brooklyn\\'s So Gold Studies, piercer and founder Cassi Lopez-March requires that clients have at least three existing piercings and be willing to get one to three additional piercings during an ear curation session. She finds that more of her clients are seeking out \"full-blown ear styling\" rather than coming in with pre-determined placements because the average person does not always know what they want. \"When someone gives us free reign to kind of have fun with it, that\\'s when the magic happens,\" she shares.OrbitalsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyIf you google \"orbital piercing,\" you\\'ll see a couple of different piercing locations, but don\\'t let the internet confuse you, Cassi Lopez-March says. \"An actual orbital is just one ring that connects two holes,\" she explains. You can get two new piercings or use new jewelry to connect older ones. She has noticed this placement becoming extremely popular with clients who want to refresh their old holes and give them a new life. At her shop, they tend to add orbitals to the lobe area to connect second or even third piercings.NavalCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2017, I fulfilled one of my childhood dreams of getting a belly button piercing. I remember a friend of mine was a bit shocked that I chose the location given that it was no longer \"popular.\" But it looks like I may have been ahead of the curve (and honestly, I don\\'t make my decisions on trends alone) because both Maysonet and Lopez-March see a resurgence in belly rings coming soon.Just like fashion and beauty trends, nostalgia is winning once again with piercings, seeing as belly rings had their last heyday in the 2000s. But Maysonet has seen folks adding a bit of a twist to the placement by getting both the top and bottom of their bellies pierced rather than choosing just one or the other.Flat HelixCourtesy of Instagram/@studsFolks are becoming more interested in receiving multiple piercings at once rather than just one. \"Right now, I think the piercing trends of 2022 are being influenced by the excitement and relief of returning to travel, celebrations, and concerts with new trends of bold self-expression,\" Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of piercing studio Studs where they focus exclusively on ear piercings, shares. That\\'s why she predicts that a trio of piercings on the flat helix will be big in the new year.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe flat helix is specifically the flat area of cartilage located in the upper ear. Bubbers says it\\'s a great spot because you can try out a few different types of jewelry options and have fun with customization. She\\'s also noticed an increase in asymmetrical placements, which can be done in this area.EyebrowGetty ImagesRecently, we\\'ve noticed certain celebrities with new eyebrow piercings — some fake, some real. On September 27, Lil Nas X showed off his new eyebrow piercing on TikTok to fans\\' praise. (Since then we haven\\'t really seen it make another appearance, so who knows if the jewelry was just a fake-out.)Cardi B debuted her own eyebrow piercing during Paris Fashion Week in one of the best ways possible. She showed out in an extravagant red Mugler dress and cape with bedazzled red brows and a silver ring through her left eyebrow. The eyebrow was a popular piercing location in the \\'90s and 2000s, and it seems like it will be reentering the mainstream in 2022.Snakebites/StacksCourtesy of Instagram/@ileanastabbedmeMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2019, Studs created their signature \"Snakebite\" piercing, which model Kaia Gerber helped make popular. The name may be a bit confusing if you\\'re used to the Snakebite lip piercing — which typically means two piercings spaced out at each outer corner of the lower lip — but this is an ear piercing that involves stacking two holes close together on the outer cartilage of the mid-ear area. Bubbers says they expect to see folks trying the piercing in new places like the Forward Helix and Conch in 2022.The jewelry in these holes is just as important as the piercings themselves. Scrolling through Studs\\'s Instagram, you\\'ll see ears full of these Snakebite piercings with gold and silver jewelry in all shapes and sizes.NosesCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMaysonet has also seen an increase in nose piercings, both on the nostril and the septum. She cites the resurgence of punk, alternative, and even scene aesthetics as the impetus for this rise. We\\'re also willing to bet that once mask mandates are lifted in certain areas that it will allow more people to finally try the piercing placement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesYou can get a simple septum or nostril piercing or go all out and try two piercings, whether that be with one hole in each nostril, two holes in one nostril, or a septum and nostril piercing. It\\'s up to you to decide what kind of fun you\\'re into.With the unpredictability of the past two years, there\\'s truly no knowing what will happen in the piercing world. But we are sure that more and more folks will continue to dip into creativity and give their piercer freedom to guide them along their piercing journey.Read more stories about body modification:Contraconch Piercings Are Gaining Popularity For Their Unexpected PlacementYour Complete Guide to Vulva PiercingsHow Your Belly Button Piercing Changes When You Get PregnantNow watch 100 years of piercings:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'It almost felt like the MTV VMAs were back to their pre-pandemic form tonight at the 2022 show. Nicki Minaj, LL Cool J, and Jack Harlow hosted and kept us entertained throughout the music-filled night. Minaj was even awarded the 2022 VMA Video Vanguard award, both exciting and well deserved. In addition to these three celebs, Lizzo, Bad Bunny, and Anitta all blessed the stage with their voices.The performances were amazing, and our eyes were zoned in on what these stars were wearing from head to toe, both on and off the stage. They were already wowing us with their massive feather headpieces, face jewelry, and slicked-back hair, but we were also obsessing over all the manicures. Here are just a few that we are loving.Dove CameronGetty ImagesDove Cameron went for dark grunge vibes at the awards show. She paired her strapless leather and floral gown with smoked-out burgundy eye makeup, plum glossy lips, and stiletto-shaped nails.

For example, there were deep red rose charms and silver gems on each middle finger. If you look closely, you might have noticed the black scissor decals on each ring fingernail.Betty WhoGetty ImagesThe Australian-born singer-songwriter showed up with black-and-white graphic nails. Each hand had different nail designs. On one hand, there were various sizes of white and black stars on each nail. The other hand had white hearts on the index and ring fingers. The white design on the middle finger was actually an ode to the awards show; it\\'s the iconic MTV logo.Monét X ChangeGetty ImagesMonét X Change had already caught over eyes with her large afro puffs and bright tropical-inspired makeup, but we made sure not to forget her white swirly tips.

Her bedazzled metallic nails practically blend into her dress in the above photo. The medium-length, almond-shaped nails were full of sparkly gems and jewels.Lil Nas XGetty ImagesNow, hearing the words \"goth Big Bird\" probably sounds like the strangest and worst thing in the world, but we swear Lil Nas X\\'s VMAs outfit will make you rethink that. The rapper showed out with a massive black feather headpiece with matching pants. It\\'s hard to take your eyes off this elaborate feather piece, but the mismatched manicure he wore that night also deserves some fanfare.OPI Nail Lacquer in Bubble Bath$11OPI Nail Lacquer in Black Onyx$11Two nails on each hand were painted completely black by nail artist Temeka Jackson who used OPI GelColor polishes, which are exclusively available to nail artists, to complete this look. Thankfully, the two shades she used, Bubble Bath (pale pink) and Black Onyx (pitch black), are available in nail lacquer form, so this look can be recreated at home. With the Black Onyx polish and a thin brush, she drew French tips, geometric shapes, and lines to create the nail art.Becky GGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesBecky G looked gorgeous in a sequined gown that looked just like a stained glass window.

The different clips stitched together show the model in a pink velvet bathing suit (ah, a true sign of an L.A. winter) with frosty pink eye makeup and matching pink butterfly clips pulling her hair back from her face.\"Todays vibe,\" the nonchalant caption reads, along with a couple of emojis. Throughout the video, Bieber smiles and makes duck faces while she shows off her look. Her hair is middle-parted and styled with natural beach waves and baby braids. As for makeup, she\\'s opted for layered pink eye shadow: a lighter shade on her inner lids, and a darker hue on her outer lids. Pink glitter serves as her eyeliner, which rims both lash lines and extends outward into a baby wing. The monochromatic look also features a rosy blush, a pink lip color, and soft highlighter on her cheek bones. We\\'re taking notes, and plan on channeling this look all spring long.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.For her nails, she\\'s staying on-trend with a classic French oval manicure so simple that it doesn\\'t take away from her finger tattoos.

She\\'s wearing a few necklaces, including mixed and matched pearls with a custom letter bead necklace (although we can\\'t read what it spells out), two belly chains, and gold hoop earrings.We love all of Hailey\\'s content (shout-out to her skin-care tips, pictures with Justin, and TikTok dances), but we can\\'t get enough of her glowing beauty looks, either.

And while it's all too common for some to slouch when it comes to following the theme of the night, one guest nailed it in the gilded glamor department at the 2022 Met Gala. Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers. It was shiny gold and covered in ruby and pearl-looking appliqués. She also sported a gold, armor-esque covering on her other pointer finger. The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore. Somehow, it was both a retro and futuristic look all at once. And one that set the hearts of internet critics aflame.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.King kept the rest of her beauty look simple, with cropped hair and minimal-looking makeup. Because why take attention away from the nail situation?

If that wasn\\'t enough, the \"Kiss Me More\" singer made our jaws drop with the stunning Schiaparelli black gown and gold accessories she wore for the awards show. By now we expect the pop star to capture our attention with every new look, but we didn\\'t expect her to show up to the event with short nails or intricate gold rings that look like they\\'re worth more than my student loans.The \"Say So\" singer didn\\'t hesitate to take risks for this look, something we love from her. Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas gave her a neutral smokey eye with a hint of bright yellow on the inner crease and waterline that complemented the daring gown very well. As for her hair, hairstylist Jared Henderson (known as JStay Ready to many) slicked her dark hair into a high ponytail with a flipped end that we have a good feeling was fun to whip around.Getty ImagesTypically Doja Cat wears lengthy nails, but for this look, she kept them short. Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe. But this manicure is anything but simple, because this opulent jewelry is basically nail art.Her middle finger had the largest ring, which covered her entire finger and nail. The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own. The other two rings were simpler, which is saying something.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one!

The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me.

One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade. As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says.

As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says.

Yep, it\\'s equally as disappointing when you find an eye-catching set of earrings only to find it\\'s made of materials that could irritate your skin. Sure, they say pain is beauty, but when that pain involves itchiness, redness, and uncomfortable rashes (on an already-thin and sensitive part of your skin, no less), it begs the question: \"were these hoops really worth it?\" The short answer is, well, no.And remember: you\\'ll know if your piercing is infected if it\\'s red, inflamed, sore, hot to touch, or if it\\'s releasing puss. You should consult with your physician if you suspect you have an infection.The truth is, if you\\'re someone who struggles with finding earrings that won\\'t cause discomfort, you may have to work a little harder to find your match. \"Unfortunately, sterling silver jewelry is made with a mix of metals, often nickel, which is the most significant irritant to sensitive ears,\" explains Ottawa-based medical director of Concept Medical Samuel Hetz, MD. \"Those with sensitive ears want to find hypoallergenic rhodium-plated jewelry with low to no nickel content.\" He recommends looking for the standard benchmarks of 14k gold or above as well as sterling silver 925 grade to reduce the chances of nickel content.Because we don\\'t believe those with sensitive skin should be left out of the party, we rounded up nine of the best earrings for sensitive ears that are always stylish, and never irritating.BaubleBar Sutara 18K Gold Earrings$48 at BaubleBar$42 at NordstromFor sensitive-skinned folks, Baublebar\\'s Sutara Earrings will make you thank your lucky stars they\\'re made out of 18k gold.

All around me were people filling in or touching up their ink, but I continued onward past the buzzing needles — straight to the back, where the piercer works. After a tough year, I was ready for a bit of body modification to memorialize the challenges and symbolize the jump forward into 2022. What I didn\\'t realize, as I asked for a third lobe piercing to continue to build my stack of hoops, is that my bright idea was of a pace with a wide new piercing trend.More and more customers are asking for what Alaina Rothstein, cofounder of Los Angeles ear piercing service Leo West, refers to as a \"milestone piercing.\" Rothstein has seen mothers and daughters come in for birthday piercing; she knows of a woman who miscarried and got a stud to remind her of the loss. \"It\\'s a fun, really beautiful way to carry something special with you in happy times and in sad times,\" she says. \"And I think it\\'s like super cool that it\\'s translated [from the tattoo world] into the piercing world.\"Our piercers have seen birthdays, bachelorette parties, and groups of friends come in to celebrate together. But what trends are they trying, specifically? In other words, which parts of the ear are getting the most adoration through adornment right now?Meet the experts:Alaina Rothstein and Jill Katz, RN, cofounders of Los Angeles ear-piercing service Leo WestLisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a piercing studio with locations in New York, Texas, and California (among others)Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer at Live by the Sword Tattoo in Brooklyn, New YorkIn This Story:Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?How to Pick Your PiercerConstellation PiercingsStacked LobesVertical StacksForward HelixSnakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)ConchOuter Conch, a.k.a. SconchJump ahead, or read on for everything you need to know about the freshest ear-piercing trends, as well as the estimated length of time the healing process may take.Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?Milestones are one reason customers are flocking to their local licensed piercer, but another is a generalized sense of freedom and autonomy that\\'s arrived as a result of the pandemic. \"With remote work and workplace norms overall changing, more people are feeling free to experiment with bolder looks and express their personality,\" says Lisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a national piercing studio. That experimentation shows up both in the amount of piercings and in the piercings themselves, which are getting \"more creative,\" Bubbers says. (Plus, as Rothstein points out, \"one fun thing about mask-wearing is that your ears show.\")The last \"really important trend,\" as Leo West cofounder Jill Katz, RN describes it, is \"adorning what you got.\" There\\'s no normal, she says. A gorgeous earscape is all about working with your budget and your anatomy to create an embodiment of your style in tiny, beautiful silver, gold, or gem form.The result: forward helices, vertically stacked lobes, conches, sconches, snake bites, and plenty of other piercing types we never knew existed, spanning from the outer rims of the ear to the inner cartilage and back to the earlobe. Our trend-spotting piercers shared the adornments they\\'ve seen grow more popular over 2022, and what they envision for the years (and ears!) to come.How to Pick Your PiercerJust as with microblading, filler, or any other body modification, it\\'s important to find a professional piercer that you trust, with a style that appeals to you. This is an essential step, whether you’re a longtime body modification fan or it’s your first piercing ever.As Brooks notes, the benefit of following a piercer on social media is that you can seek them out and, as in one service she offers, put your ear(s) in her hands. During a \"curation\" appointment, the expert will look at your ear as a whole and help design multiple piercings to fit your style and your desires.At Leo West, that might look like getting multiple differentiated piercings on each ear. \"Symmetry is out,\" says Rothstein. As she points out, a specialist is extra helpful if you\\'re nervous about curating an asymmetrical look. \"It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t want ears that match, but it has to have a rhyme or reason to it,\" she says. \"I have two ears, and I like to say ‘one’s a little bit classy, one\\'s a little bit sassy.\\'\"Constellation PiercingsInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhile some of this year\\'s trends include holes in unexpected places, more of them involve third, fourth, or fifth additions to an already-pierced ear. At Leo West, the result is what they\\'ve named a \"constellation.\" A constellation consists of \"really small pieces, close together, closer than what your traditional spacing would be,\" explains Rothstein. The result is an \"intentionally random\" grouping of ear piercings that show off studs and gems.Stacked LobesInstagram user @leowestco\"People often come in [to the studio] and say \\'I’m not cool enough,\\'\" for a trendy piercing, recounts Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer in Brooklyn. If you\\'re intimidated by the thought of a conch piercing or even a constellation, Brooks thinks that an ear stack is an easier entry point. These piercings are less painful than their cartilage-filled brethren, and can make their way up the lobe either evenly spaced or placed close together.Vertical StacksInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"If I\\'m being honest, I love to put my hair behind my ear to show the little pops of pieces sitting right above your classic [piercing],\" laughs Rothstein. She\\'s referring to a vertical stack, which entails a piercing centered directly above your traditional first or second hole. It\\'s usually filled with a small stone or a small star, Rothstein\\'s favorite. This piercing does require a certain amount of space on the lobe, but if you have enough canvas to play with, it \"gives the ear a little extra uniqueness.\"Forward Helixcourtesy of StudsThe official name for that bouncy piece of cartilage where your ear meets your skull is the \"forward helix.\" According to Bubbers, customers are coming in requesting one or even multiple piercings on the forward helix. \"We do see new and different piercing trends emerge each year based on what’s trending in fashion, culture, and celebrity,\" she says. Celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Chantal Jeffries have helped popularize the new (and finicky — helix piercings can take up to nine months to heal) style.Snakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)In the realm of body piercing, the term \"snakebite\" typically refers to two piercings on either side of your lower lip, oftentimes barbells or studs.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen it comes to ears, however, it entails two holes placed close together, slightly separated from the rest of your ear piercings, giving the impression of that your piercer just might have used two fangs to get the job done. According to Bubbers, most customers opt for a snakebite in their “midi,\" the center point of the outer ear.ConchInstagram user @leowestcoWe\\'ve named conch piercings as of-trend for the past few years, but the cartilage piercing is still popular enough to remain on the list. It pierces through the inner-ear cartilage that makes up the back of the year. At Studs, Bubbers says customers are opting more and more for a snakebite on the conch for a doubly trendy effect.Outer Conch (Sometimes Known as a \"Sconch\")courtesy of Studs\"I hope you don\\'t use this name,\" laughs Brooks. She prefers the more medical-sounding \"outer conch,\" but the phrase \"sconch\" is catching on to describe a piercing placed at the lining ridge in the cavern space close to the center of the ear.\"It\\'s right in your eye-line when people look at you,\" she says, so it provides a way to show a bit of personality even when you\\'re on Zoom or wearing a mask. Because it\\'ll be eye-catching no matter what kind of earring(s) you have in, Brooks likes adorning an outer conch piercing with a piece of jewelry that makes a big statement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesMore on the world of piercings:How Tongue Piercings Work, From Pain Level and Placement to Aftercare and Healing TimeHow to Remove Every Type of Piercing at Home8 Types of Ear Piercings, ExplainedContraconch Ear Piercings Are Gaining Popularity for Its Unexpected PlacementIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?

That way, I have a scent memory anchored to that destination or time period for whenever I choose to relive it. My last international trip, to a prestigious wellness resort in Austria for some on-the-ground reporting, demanded a very specific choice: something compact enough to fit in my carry-on without getting tossed by TSA, calming enough to match the vibe of the Alpine oasis, and extra long-lasting so it would last through hikes, meals, and medical treatments without reapplication. Lastly, it would need to smell expensive, because my fellow wellness-seekers would expect as much — but we\\'ll get to that later.After much deliberation, I landed on a luxe new formula that had just hit my desk before my flight: the Jennifer Fisher My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil.My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil$65I was initially surprised that Jennifer Fisher, a jewelry designer beloved by her red carpet clientele and the master behind some of Jennifer Lopez\\'s favorite hoop earrings, had ventured into perfumery. That said, fragrance does feel like a sparkling accessory that amps up any outfit or beauty look, and Fisher wanted her new perfume oil to make a statement for the wearer. \"I want anyone wearing My Scent to feel confident and sexy,\" she tells Allure. “And to smell like a fresh baked cookie.\" Upon first wear, I didn\\'t flag baked goods as a top note, but I did instantly fall for the vanilla and coconut Fisher knew she wanted to include in the formula.\"The blend of vanilla and coconut brings back memories from my childhood growing up in Santa Barbara, California,\" she says. \"For years, I was combining different vanilla and coconut fragrances to try and create my own personal scent. Finding a scent that was a combination of surf wax from the beaches in my hometown, Montecito, and a fresh baked cookie is what I\\'ve always wanted.\"Australian sandalwood, pear, and Tonka bean flank the creamy hero notes, and it all comes together to smell equal parts sunny and cozy, like throwing on a cashmere sweater on a breezy summer night. Toting it around is just as effortless too: I carried the teeny-tiny rollerball in my airplane carry-on, my spa robe to and from massages and lunch, and even in my fanny pack while Nordic walking in the mountains.No, really, I took this tube everywhere with me.\\nTaylore Glynn\"I wanted to come out with something small, compact, and portable you could throw in your bag and take everywhere with you,\" says Fisher. \"A spray to me didn\\'t feel as transportable, but that doesn\\'t mean I am ruling it out for the next product. This oil was designed intentionally to be worn and carried on-the-go.\" In addition to being totable, the formula also fulfilled my need for something that would last through spa treatments and saunas.\"Coconut is a good oil carrier to round out scents,\" says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, noting that scent can last longer in oil form because it\\'s not watered down. \"Atomized scents usually contain alcohol to help spraying. Fragrance oil is the most concentrated form [you can find].\"The scent was so powerful that even my fellow resort guests noticed. In fact, I was flagged down multiple times in the dining room and in the halls to reveal what I was wearing because it smelled \"beautiful\" and \"divine.\" For important context, some of the resort guests on the premises at the time — who I can\\'t explicitly identify — included one of the most famous supermodels of our generation, an Oscar-winning actress, and an entirely different famous jewelry designer with whom I chatted about ketamine therapy. I realized that My Scent smelled flat-out expensive, which seems to be a selling point amongst perfume enthusiasts on social media. In fact, there\\'s a whole genre of #FragranceTok posts dedicated to perfumes that make you smell, well, rich. After studying these videos, there\\'s a handful of perfumes that seem to universally smell like wealth: Parfums de Marly Delina, Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Montale Paris Intense Cafe, and three different Maison Francis Kurkdjian perfumes.Courtesy of brandParfums de Marly Delina$335Courtesy of brandYves Saint Laurent Libre Eau de Parfum Spray$140 $112 at NordstromIntense Cafe Eau de Parfum$170Courtesy of brandMaison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540$325They all also happen to share one intoxicating note: vanilla, which lies at the heart of My Scent.

Well, we say it's time to take a moment to appreciate such bold choices, such as Doja Cat's quirky makeup looks from Paris Fashion week — she still has us wondering how her shirt remained white with all that gold. And we certainly can't leave out the Hadid sisters' bleached brows for their own prance down the very same runways. It's not much of a shocker, then, that Gigi Hadid went for something a bit odd and definitely bold for a recent red-carpet beauty moment. For the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards on November 7, Hadid graced the carpet with an unconventional cool gray lipstick.I'll be the first to admit that I did a double-take at first glimpse. No, it's not your typical choice where a lipstick shade is concerned, but makeup artists Patrick Ta and Akina Shimizu were able to pull off this muted-yet-fresh-faced makeup look on Hadid. Catch me zooming in on those lips that are seemingly matte and glossy at the same time. We're definitely not the only ones hoping the details will soon be dropped on what particular beauty brand this lipstick is made by. Nonetheless, this all-American color pallet is insanely cohesive.Let's also not forget the striking blonde hair color and the sleek, slicked-back bun hair stylist Laura Polko put together to bring out the jewelry on Hadid's ears and nose. My favorite part is the septum ring paired with the tartan-patterned Thom Browne attire styled by Mimi Cuttrell — it's full-on grunge. I'm honestly tempted to break out my alternative pop-rock playlist, like, now.

The supermodel went for a runway-ready vibe for both of her costumes this year, though they were extremely different in tone.For her first look, Bieber covered herself in roses to pay homage to an Yves Saint Laurent haute couture runway look from 1999, originally worn by model Laetitia Casta. In her carousel of pics, Bieber wears a top and miniskirt made of huge pink roses, enhanced by a matching pink organza ruffled train at her hips. Roses also pop up on one ankle and serve as a flower crown atop her head. The look is very The Birth of Venus but make it fashion —and floral.Bieber let the roses be the centerpiece of her costume and kept her hair and makeup subtle and natural with radiant \"glazed\" skin, deep rose lips, and a hint of shimmery pink eye shadow, then finished off the costume with a pale pink and white manicure. She wore no jewelry or accessories other than her engagement diamond and a pair of pale pink ankle-strap sandals. While Casta wore the rose look with Raphaelite ringlet curls, Bieber decided on loose brunette waves for a more modern approach. I just have one question, Hailey: Are those real roses? Hopefully, you de-thorned them if so!Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Later on during Halloweekend, Bieber ditched the angelic florals of her first costume in favor of something darker: a \"Versace Vampire.\" The model donned a strappy black bustier top and high-waisted black skirt with a black and gold Versace logo belt, opera-length shiny black latex gloves, and a pair of vampire fangs for the Goth-inspired vampire moment. A black wig, bright purple eyeshadow, flushed cheeks, and blood-red lips (obviously), plus chunky gold necklaces and huge gold and pearl earrings added to the glamourous \\'90s Versace vibe; she could have walked right off a Gianni Versace runway, minus the fangs.Instagram/Hailey BieberThe two looks may have been complete opposites, but they paid homage to Bieber\\'s fashion roots in the most gorgeously spooky and stunning way.More celeb Halloween looks you may have missed:The Kardashian\\'s Halloween Costumes Included Mystique, Bride of Frankenstein and Jessie from Toy StoryYou Have to See Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly as Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee for HalloweenMegan Thee Stallion Has Outdone Herself in the Halloween Nail Art DepartmentMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNow, learn Hailey\\'s 10 biggest beauty tips:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'TikTok-turned-reality star Dixie D\\'Amelio finally committed to the hairstyle she\\'s been longing for since sixth grade.

You can find plenty of examples across social media. Just look to hashtags #tonguepiercing and #tonguepiercings on TikTok and Instagram, which have over 790 million views and 520,000 posts, respectively.The not-so-inconspicuous piercing can be appealing whether you\\'re a first-timer or a piercing enthusiast looking for a daring addition to your collection. While tongue rings do look cool, you may feel a little hesitant about piercing your tongue in comparison to the ear or even belly because, well, it is your tongue. The stakes seem higher and more dangerous should an infection occur.But despite the location, the aftercare for tongue piercings is actually a lot easier (and a lot less painful) than some would expect. Here\\'s everything you need to know before scheduling your piercing appointment, whether you\\'re undecided about taking the plunge or ready to get your tongue pierced tomorrow.Meet the experts:Jenna Myers, a piercer at Live By the Sword Tattoo in New York CityErich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone HealthLynn Loheide, a body piercer based in Nashville, TennesseeAre tongue piercings dangerous?Before you even think about setting up your appointment, it\\'s important to understand the risks associated with tongue piercings. Like any piercing, there\\'s always a possibility of infection or rejection.Sometimes the signs of infection can be easy to confuse with irritation in piercings, especially if you\\'re extra paranoid. But New York City-based piercer Jenna Myers says that there tends to be a pretty big distinction between the two.\"[With an] infection, your tongue is going to look absolutely wild,\" Myers shares. \"It\\'ll be two to three times the size, turning almost green or white, [with puss].\" When that happens, she always advises going to the ER for professional help. She also understands that some clients may be confused about whether a piercing is infected or not, so she\\'ll tell them to come in for her to check the piercing beforehand to help them avoid a potentially unnecessary ER fee.Erich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone Health, notes that pus, severe tongue swelling, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and difficult breathing indicate that it\\'s time to seek out a medical professional. Typically, infected piercings are usually treated with antibiotics and the removal of jewelry, he explains.But there are some rare cases where surgery might be needed to drain an abscess or deal with any other complications, according to Dr. Voigt. For example, he once had to perform an emergency surgery on a patient because their tongue started to fill with blood and swell, leading them to choke. \"Fortunately, I was able to take the person to the operating room, remove the piercing (which was difficult because half of it became incorporated into the swollen tongue), incise the tongue, tie off a bleeding artery and well as cauterize the muscles, and then suture the tongue back together,\" Dr. Voigt shares.Luckily, not every tongue piercing will become infected. Still, it\\'s important to note that regardless of placement, the piercing can cause damage to the teeth and gums, according to piercer Lynn Loheide and Dr. Voigt. \"You need to understand that going into it, be okay with that risk, and also know what you have to do to minimize that risk,\" Loheide shares.Are horizontal \"snake eyes\" tongue piercings safe?Speaking of placement, there are restrictions as to where the tongue piercing can go. You might have heard of snake eyes before. For those who are unfamiliar, this style typically refers to a horizontal tongue piercing at the tip of the tongue. And if you had hopes of getting that piercing, keep dreaming. Unfortunately, experts say that tongue piercings should only go vertically through the tongue because horizontal placement comes with a big risk of damage to the teeth and gum recession.\"When we\\'re piercing vertically, especially in the center, we\\'re piercing through a connective tissue between those muscles,\" Loheide explains. \"But when you\\'re piercing horizontally, you\\'re actually pinning those muscles together, and that can cause a lot of damage.\" They also note that in the state of Oregon, horizontal tongue piercings are banned for this reason.Can anyone get a tongue piercing?Though everyone\\'s tongue is different, Loheide says if your tongue is too short or you have a tongue-tie — which is basically when the webbing underneath your tongue comes almost or all the way to the tip — a tongue piercing is probably not the best option for you.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen you arrive at your appointment, don\\'t be surprised if the piercer starts analyzing your mouth. In fact, that\\'s a good sign because your unique anatomy will dictate where you can and can\\'t get pierced, and any reputable piercer will ensure to take that into account, Loheide shares.\"We want to see where the blood flow is along the underside of the tongue and make sure that we\\'re not too close to it,\" they explain. \"But we also want to look at the shape of someone\\'s teeth and someone\\'s mouth when we\\'re deciding placement.\" That way, a piercer can ensure that they aren\\'t causing unnecessary damage and that the jewelry won\\'t rub up uncomfortably against your teeth.What can I expect during a tongue piercing appointment?Before your appointment, it\\'s imperative that you brush your teeth and tongue before arriving. Myers shares that typically her clients are given mouthwash right before to help clean their mouths out.As mentioned above, most of your appointment will be spent on prepping and checking your tongue before the needle is inserted. The actual piercing part of the session is short, just like most other piercings — a hollow needle is pushed through the tongue, and then the piercer adds the jewelry, which is a barbell shape.For standard tongue piercings, the ring is usually in the center of the tongue. Though horizontal piercings are a big no-no, you can still get two vertical tongue piercings. Some may call them venom piercings, but Loheide prefers to just refer to them as paired tongue piercings because for some people venom refers to two horizontal piercings, and the slang terms used change over time.\"Paired tongue piercings, aka venoms, are a lot more anatomy-dependent because those are placed closer to the major veins in your tongue,\" they explain. \"So we have to make sure that there\\'s space around that blood flow for them to be placed safely.\"Like any piercing, you should expect pain, and though it\\'s subjective, Loheide and Myers both swear that a tongue piercing is not as bad as you might think. \"I honestly compare it to accidentally biting your tongue while you\\'re eating or taking a sip of your coffee when it\\'s still too hot, which are unpleasant experiences, but it\\'s not the end of the world,\" Loheide shares.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn fact, they say that the most uncomfortable part is having the piercer\\'s hands in your mouth for an extended amount of time. Myers notes that on a scale of one to 10, most of her clients rate standard tongue piercings between a one to three, and paired tongue piercings a three to five.What does aftercare for a tongue piercing look like?There are a few things to expect immediately after your piercing. If you\\'ve been pierced before, some of these won\\'t be too shocking, but there are certain effects that are specific to tongue piercings.Right after your appointment, expect your tongue to be a bit swollen and painful for about one to two weeks, according to Loheide. That\\'s naturally going to happen because the piercing is a fresh wound. In addition to the pain and swelling, you\\'ll also deal with a slight lisp or change in how you speak. \"After about a week, the swelling will go down, and then the rest of the healing process is pretty easy,\" they share.Myers estimates that for a single tongue piercing, it will take about one to three months and three to five for paired piercings. \"Because the tongue is so vascular, it has a lot of blood flow to it, so it heals really quickly,\" she says. On the other hand, Loheide says to expect it to take about three to five months to be fully healed.Thankfully, the aftercare for tongue piercings isn\\'t too complicated. In general, maintaining good oral hygiene — brushing your teeth regularly and flossing — is important. Once you get home, Loheide recommends immediately changing out your toothbrush for a new one and using milder oral hygiene products. They advise avoiding toothpaste with whitening ingredients.Both piercers strongly suggest using an alcohol-free mouthwash that won\\'t burn your mouth. Loheide likes Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse because it doesn\\'t taste as badly as some alcohol-free mouthwashes do, it\\'s affordable, and can be found in most drug stores. Myers also recommends sterile saline solution, which tends to be recommended for most piercings.Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse$10Apart from switching up your oral products, you may have to change what you eat, but only for a short while. Myers suggests avoiding spicy, crunchy, and acidic foods in the first few weeks to avoid irritation. \"Things that you wouldn\\'t [want on] a paper cut, basically, you don\\'t want to eat the first few weeks of a tongue piercing, because it will cause serious discomfort,\" she says.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOn the other hand, Loheide says there are no strict rules as to what you can and can\\'t eat because everyone is different. But you still have to be mindful of how your mouth and tongue feel when you do eat or drink certain things. \"If you go to eat something and you\\'re like, \\'Wow, this feels terrible to eat,\\' don\\'t keep eating it,\" they share.Ultimately, try to not go overboard with your piercing aftercare, because that could potentially case more irritation. \"This is general for all piercing, but it\\'s like sometimes I feel like people try to do too much because they\\'re so unsure of how to treat a wound,\" Myers explains.\" Being as simple as possible with your aftercare is really best. Your body is really good at healing itself.\"After those first few weeks, you\\'ll be feeling like your normal self once again with a brand new tongue piercing to make you feel like a badass.Read more stories about piercings:7 Piercing Trends That Will Be Everywhere in 2022How to Remove Every Kind of Piercing Jewelry at HomeIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?Now enjoy the unboxing of the April 2022 Allure Beauty Box:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'Doja Cat is ready to travel to a galaxy far, far away.

Popularized in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, the timing for this resurgence makes sense: We\\'re already sticking Y2K-inspired rhinestones on our faces, breaking out the frosted eye shadow, and revisiting \"thong jeans\" so low-rise they would make even Paris Hilton blush. It was only a matter of time before bonding Swarovski crystal butterflies to our enamel made a comeback, too.Dental bling may be one of this year\\'s biggest beauty trends, but it\\'s nothing new. Anthropological records show that dentists as far back as the Mayan Empire decorated teeth with jade, gold, and turquoise, according to Anjali Rajpal, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California, nicknamed \"The Diamond Dentist\" on account of the bejeweled designs she creates for her celebrity clientele.Tooth jewelry also has significance in Black culture — a well-known example is grills, which were first worn by West Indian immigrants in the \\'70s and \\'90s hip-hop artists. Grills are decorative covers made of gold, silver, or encrusted with jewels that snap over one or more teeth and are removed at the end of each day. Tooth gems as we know them today differ from grills, but it\\'s important to recognize the cultures they\\'re derived from.Instead of a mouthful of precious metal, tooth gems are usually a single or a few delicate multi-colored gems or diamonds that are bonded individually to the teeth. Pinterest is clearly here for the trend, with the site reporting an 85 percent uptick in searches for \"tooth gems\" last year alone, while TikTok views for the hashtag #toothgems currently stand at 130.4m. \"Tooth gems add a little edge to someone\\'s style and are a less invasive way to make a statement than a tattoo,\" Dr. Rajpal tells Allure.Aesthetics aside, what about the dental health implications of these tiny adornments? We asked experts to share how tooth gems can be applied, and cared for, safely.Meet the Experts:Anjali Rajpal, DMD, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California.Michael Apa, DDS, an aesthetic dentist in New York City.Brian Kantor, DDS, a cosmetic dentist in New York City.How are tooth gems applied?Everyone\\'s bite is different, so there\\'s no avoiding a consultation first – sorry, dentist\\'s orders. \"[A consultation appointment] is also an opportunity to take my client\\'s style and personality into account when collaborating with them for their jewelry design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.If you\\'re choosing a semi-permanent tooth gem, no drilling is required: The technique is similar to the way braces are applied. \"An acidic solution (or etching gel) is placed on the tooth\\'s surface, microscopically roughening the enamel, before the gemstone is bonded to it with an adhesive and curing lamp,\" explains New York City-based aesthetic dentist Michael Apa. The whole process only takes a matter of minutes and is painless, provided the gem is bonded to the surface of a healthy tooth, Dr. Apa says. \"If you\\'ve got worn-away enamel from grinding your teeth or eating too many acidic foods, there will likely be sensitivity,\" he adds.Permanent tooth gems do require drilling a hole in the desired location, so be ready for the commitment if you\\'re planning on getting this adornment because it won\\'t be easy to remove. Also worth noting: While tooth gems can be bonded to veneers, Dr. Apa says they can\\'t be worn with Invisalign.How much do tooth gems cost?There\\'s no one-size-fits-all price tag. The cost will largely depend on your choice of design and materials (a Swarovski crystal, for example, will be cheaper than a diamond). Some dentists charge two separate fees – one for the gemstone and another for the application. \"My in-office fees include both and can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the size, quality, and quantity of the stones and the nature of the design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.How long do tooth gems last?Most tooth gems are semi-permanent and can last anywhere between six months to one year, says Brian Kantor, a cosmetic dentist in New York City. The right aftercare and dental materials used to bond the gemstone to the tooth will help you get the most out of your new dental jewelry.\"For the first 24 hours after getting a tooth gem, you should only eat soft foods and avoid using an electric toothbrush or drinking soda, coffee, or tea to protect the fresh bond,\" says Dr. Kantor, adding that picking or playing with your tooth gem is also off-limits. Sometimes a tooth gem may fall off on its own if you bite down hard on something, but Dr. Kantor says not to worry: \"There\\'s no harm to your tooth if that happens and the gem can simply be re-attached.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSemi-permanent tooth gems can also be safely removed by a dentist if you change your mind or want to switch up the design. “The gem is simply polished off along with any adhesive on the tooth,\" says Dr. Rajpal. As for permanent tooth gems, though, be warned that removing a permanent tooth gem that was inserted into a tooth will leave a hole. \"This hole will then need to be filled in with a white filling material that is color-matched to the existing shade of the tooth,\" adds Dr. Rajpal.Are tooth gems safe?If you ask Dr. Apa, tooth gems are purely an accessory. \"They\\'re a very specific aesthetic choice because they don\\'t offer the restorative benefits that come with veneers or crowns,\" he says. On top of not offering any benefits, there are a few dental risks that come with getting a set of gems.\"Tooth gems can trap plaque and create places for stray food particles and harmful bacteria to hide,\" Dr. Kantor explains. Needless to say, keeping the gem clean and practicing good oral hygiene is essential if you want to avoid gum inflammation, decay, or other dental issues. Alongside regular flossing, Dr. Apa recommends brushing twice a day with a non-abrasive toothpaste and soft bristle sonic toothbrush \"because the vibration offers a deeper clean and dislodges food stuck to the gemstone,\" he says.The bottom line? In general, as long as a dentist applies your chosen gem, and you\\'re taking proper care of your teeth at home, \"the risks are minimal,\" Dr. Apa says. In the wrong hands, he warns you could end up getting a gem with a rough surface that can cause traumatic lesions on the inside of the lip. \"Or if the gem isn\\'t placed properly, you can break an opposing tooth when you bite down,\" he cautions.So, I shouldn\\'t try applying tooth gems at home?Nope! Advice from dentists hasn\\'t stopped folks from taking the DIY route with nail art gems and superglue, but it should. \"It sounds obvious, but nobody should be ingesting toxic glue,\" insists Dr. Rajpal, who prefers to work with biocompatible materials such as gold and precious or semiprecious stones. \"Besides, glue doesn\\'t properly bond the gem to the tooth structure as well as dental materials,\" she explains. \"It\\'s far safer for a tooth gem to be applied by an experienced dentist, using a non-toxic material and polished to avoid any bacterial traps, as it will last longer, be more comfortable and hygienic.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesFor the same reason, Dr. Apa recommends a dentist remove the gem to avoid accidentally stripping away healthy enamel or tooth structure. \"You shouldn\\'t DIY anything in dentistry,\" he says. \"Tooth gem application is a dental procedure, and all procedures should be performed by a professional.\"More stories to take a bite into:I Took on Credit Card Debt to Get Braces as an AdultDentists Reveal the Correct Order to Brush Your Teeth, Floss, and Use MouthwashHow to Deal With Teeth Grinding and Jaw ClenchingNow, see how dental care has evolved over the last 100 years:', 'The 2022 MTV VMAs have barely even begun, and Lizzo is already stealing the show. The \"About Damn Time\" singer arrived at the awards show in an ensemble that was almost as dark as the black carpet she walked on. She looked like she could be princess of the underworld or even a gothic cake topper with her massive navy blue gown, dark lipstick, and golden rings on her ears, fingers, and lips.Where do you even start with a look like this? The singer\\'s navy blue gown was a gorgeous rumpled, off-the-shoulder dress from Jean Paul Gaultier. She paired it with sheer navy blue gloves that covered her forearms.Her golden jewelry was as excessive as her stunning gown in all the best ways possible. On both of her ring fingers, she wore an abstract looped ring. Earrings of various sizes covered her entire cartilage and lobe. The rings along her cartilage were thicker in width but smaller in circumference, so they hugged her ear. The hoops on the lobe were much larger, nearly skimming her shoulders. The last ring lay in the middle of her bottom lip.Getty ImagesThe lip ring combined with the dark blue lipstick and slicked back, wet-looking hair gave this look an edgier vibe that fit right in at the VMAs. Makeup artist Alexx Mayo was responsible for this glam makeup and matte lip. He painted her lips with Charlotte Tilbury\\'s Rock N Kohl liner in Bedroom Black and Eye Colour Magic Liner Duo in Super Blue to create the deep navy blue hue.Hairstylist Shelby Swain, who often works with the pop star, gave Lizzo\\'s wig the wet look using Matrix\\'s Instacure Anti-Breakage Porosity Spray and Vavooom Extra Full Freezing Spray. For the simple baby hairs, Swain used Matrix\\'s Overachiever Paste 3-in-1 Cream to keep the swoops in place.It was hard to see her nails beneath her mesh gloves, but the almond-shaped claws were painted with silver nail polish by nail artist Eri Ishizu. She used OPI\\'s GelColor in Clean State as a base before adding Chrome Effects in Mixed Metals to create an iridescent finish. Those two products are exclusive to nail artist pros, but OPI\\'s Nail Lacquer in Clean Slate and Infinite Shine in Silver on Ice work as replacements.Getty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf this was just her arrival look, we can\\'t wait for what she\\'s going to be wearing on stage when she performs.

The Emily in Paris star may be called \"classic\" or \"glamorous,\" but the actor rarely ventures into the unconventional. And you could argue the same thing about luxury brand Cartier. But apparently, when the two get together, the trendy, off-beat coolness comes out — a Collins\\'s hair is proof.In the new ad campaign for Clash de Cartier, a jewelry collection that strikes a balance between classic and eccentric, Collins does exactly that. We see her in an elegant, asymmetrical black dress and red lipstick, and her brown hair is pulled back into a sleek, low bun, not unlike the style she wore for her wedding — basically exactly how we picture Lily Collins when we picture Lilly Collins.As Billy Idol\\'s \"Dancing With Myself\" plays, she stands in contrast with another version of herself that looks completely out of her beauty comfort zone, yet it somehow works so well.

Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.On Tuesday, Collins teased a preview of the look, giving us a peek at the baby bangs, which appear to have been styled by Gregory Russell. The makeup looks were done by Fiona Stiles, and the manicures by nail artist Thuy Nguyen.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Although Collins recently told us that her curtain bangs are a \"dedicated decision\" that she\\'s wanted to do \"for years but never had the courage to take the plunge,\" it looks like she may be open to trying other, unexpected fringe looks.

Her 29th birthday look has all the elements that define her signature style: inches and inches of hair, super long acrylic nails, and lots of bling.She posted a few photos of the gorgeous birthday look to Instagram on July 4, showing off her mile-long curls nearly as white as snow, pastel purple eye makeup, and baby blue nail design full of iridescent gems. She is seen in a cutout purple dress with her platinum blonde curls cascading over one of her shoulders, the ends almost grazing her knees. Though she tends to switch up her hair color often, she\\'s indulged in her blonde era many times before with this bright hue, just like when she chopped off her hair into a platinum-blonde buzz cut right at the end of 2021.The light hair color pairs beautifully with her lavender cut crease, which also complements her gown perfectly. You\\'d think the light purple shade would also make an appearance on her nails, but not at all. Instead, this stiletto manicure was painted a light blue hue, which feels like an apt choice for the water sign. Each icy blue nail was filled with opalescent jewels of various sizes running straight down the middle.

On the 2022 red carpet, it has come in the form of elaborate headpieces, an overwhelming amount of black attire for a white-tie event, and some very funky hairstyles — especially including that of Alicia Keys.Keys walked the red carpet on May 2 in a black gown, completed by a cape bedazzled with the New York City skyline (how fitting for the singer who wrote the concrete-jungle-wet-dream-tomato song). When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection. When is it not?Getty ImagesThen I caught a look at her long braid from the side and the back and now I'm bewildered by… whatever is in her hair. As you can see below, Keys's braid is — I don't even know what word to use here — woven? Woven with something I'm finding very hard to describe. It's like a black-and-silver ribbon… made out of CDs… bedazzled CDs?Getty ImagesIn short, I have no idea what is going on with this hairstyle or what to call it, but it looks damn good. Then again, Alicia Keys could've rocked up to the Met Gala in a garbage can and she still would've made it look soulfully chic. It's what she does best.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King's Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNeed more?

On the 2022 red carpet, it has come in the form of elaborate headpieces, an overwhelming amount of black attire for a white-tie event, and some very funky hairstyles — especially including that of Alicia Keys.Keys walked the red carpet on May 2 in a black gown, completed by a cape bedazzled with the New York City skyline (how fitting for the singer who wrote the concrete-jungle-wet-dream-tomato song). When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection. When is it not?Getty ImagesThen I caught a look at her long braid from the side and the back and now I'm bewildered by… whatever is in her hair. As you can see below, Keys's braid is — I don't even know what word to use here — woven? Woven with something I'm finding very hard to describe. It's like a black-and-silver ribbon… made out of CDs… bedazzled CDs?Getty ImagesIn short, I have no idea what is going on with this hairstyle or what to call it, but it looks damn good. Then again, Alicia Keys could've rocked up to the Met Gala in a garbage can and she still would've made it look soulfully chic. It's what she does best.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King's Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNeed more?

But, what if I told you there\\'s another radiance-intensifying ingredient that\\'s also a staple in your jewelry box? That\\'s right, I\\'m talking about gold, which is one of the many luminosity-amplifying ingredients in 111Skin\\'s Rose Gold Radiance Booster.111Skin is no stranger to luxury beauty: the brand has started gaining some serious hype from celebs like Kesha and it\\'s become a repeat feature in the Allure Beauty Box for its impressive, skin-nourishing formulations. Even our very own associate features director Dianna Mazzone is a fan of the brand, particularly 111Skin\\'s Vitamin C Brightening Booster. So, I already knew I was in good hands when this fancy-schmancy rose gold bottle first landed on my desk.Courtesy of brandImmediately, I did a quick scan of the label to see if my sensitive, rosacea-stricken skin could handle the formula. The serum contains a few ingredients that are already in my skin-care regimen: hydrating hyaluronic acid, brightening niacinamide, and soothing rosewater. \"The best known effect of rosewater is being anti-inflammatory, which can reduce redness and swelling in the skin,\" Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist James Wang, MD, says of the latter ingredient. \"The hydrating and antibacterial benefits, combined with its ability to calm the skin, can be especially helpful in some patients with inflammatory acne and rosacea.\"But what made me raise my eyebrows in skepticism was the pure gold extract. This may seem like a gimmicky ingredient, but Dr. Wang says that this precious metal can actually have a purpose in your skin-care routine. He notes that gold actually is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and claims of targeting fine lines and wrinkles. \"Although not a fully proven effect, gold is thought to help with wrinkles and signs of sun damage by also boosting collagen production,\" he says. With all of this in mind, Dr. Wang says this ingredient can be irritating to sensitive skin or those allergic to gold, so always patch test this product before applying it to your face.According to the bottle\\'s directions, there are two ways you can use this product: alone after cleansing or mixed into your favorite moisturizer. Whichever path you choose, the brand recommends using one to two drops. I decided to try both avenues of application simply out of curiosity and I\\'ve found that its slippery formula absorbs equally as well, regardless of how you apply it.As for its texture, the Rose Gold Radiance Booster is shimmery and has a slippery feel to it, almost like a champagne-hued version of a snail mucin serum. Once I applied it to my skin, the first thing I noticed was how teensy the gold particles were, which didn\\'t irritate my skin at all. It left a reflective veil of natural-looking shimmer without looking too intense or dramatic, and because of this, I\\'ve been reserving this sparkly serum for my morning skin-care regimen.Jennifer Hussein for AllureSo, is this gold-infused serum really worth the triple-digit price tag? Considering the fact that I\\'ve been using it daily for two months and have seen a major difference in the radiance of my complexion, my answer is a million times over, absolutely. Sure, there are many brightening skin-care products on the market, but as someone who\\'s tested hundreds of these formulations, 111Skin\\'s iridescent serum provided significant results that I haven\\'t achieved with other picks. And, at the very least, it\\'s literally liquid gold for your face, so why not treat yourself to a little luxury?111Skin Rose Gold Radiance Booster$135Want to try it for yourself?

Each design I create is a reflection of who I am.\"Short Nail Art InspirationGrowing up in Texas with family from Mexico City, Goldstein has had a wide variety of influences on her nail designs, the biggest of which was museum art. She developed an appreciation of the techniques of Diego Rivera, the Mexican painter who became Frida Kahlo\\'s husband, the color palette combinations of Josef Albers, the German artist who was the first to get solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art and the Met in New York, and the styles of her grandparents\\' house in Mexico City, which was designed by Architect Luis Barragán.\"I believe Barragán\\'s work is a study of the language of the colors of México,\" she says. \"Being surrounded by a wide palette definitely shaped my understanding of the interplay between colors and how colors affect emotions, which has impacted my designs greatly.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.When it comes to creating designs now, Goldstein uses her own style and life as inspiration. Because she uses her hands for work —through manicures and jewelry design (did we mention she owns two brands, Doublemoss Jewelry and Doublemoss Arte?) —she found that short nails are the most functional.How to Shape Short NailsGoldstein explains that shaping has the biggest impact on creating the illusion of longer nails. She\\'s a big fan of the tapered oval and square shapes but recommends avoiding flat square nails because they can make your nails look shorter. In terms of trends, every design can look good on short nails, Goldstein says, citing French tips and negative space nails as examples, but it\\'s the way the design is styled that matters.\"If you do a thick, flat French tip, it makes your short nail look shorter,\" she says, opposed to a daintier, more curved tip. \"Negative space nails work wonders for shorter nails. A clean sheer base helps minimize the attention on the nail and focus on the art.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Celebrities Who Love Short NailsWhen navigating designs with clients, Goldstein\\'s biggest goal is to make sure the nails complement the entire look, especially when doing celebrity nails for red carpet events (her résumé includes several Met Galas, U.S. press for The Batman, and The Academy of Motion Pictures Museum Opening Gala, but no big deal).Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I never want the nail art to take over,\" she says. \"Nail art is not for everyone, and I like to respect that by never pushing it on any of my clients.\"Goldstein also enjoys how collaborative the nail art process can be, naming her method with Gemma Chan, whose nails she did for the Met Gala in 2019 and 2021 and The Eternals premiere in London, as an example.\"I create a design based on what she is wearing and then consult Gemma for any tweaks or changes,\" she says. \"I love that Gemma isn\\'t scared to take risks with nails and respects the art.\"Goldstein is making major strides in bringing short nails back, and we\\'re obsessed with all of her designs. To sum it all up, we\\'d say she\\'s nailing it.

To be real, anything \"boiling over\" on our face is something we\\'d like to avoid.According to the National Eczema Association, 31.6 million people in the U.S. have some form of eczema, making it one of the most common skin conditions. If you\\'re experiencing red, irritated skin on your face (especially your eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, or chin), there\\'s a fairly good chance it\\'s facial eczema. You may already have it elsewhere on your body, or it could be on your face alone. And while there is no study evaluating the prevalence of facial eczema, specifically, New York City-based dermatologist Neil Sadick, MD, says he believes the disorder affects about a third of the population.With facial eczema, you\\'ll have to do a bit of detective work to identify what\\'s causing it. There are a few types — atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis being the two most common forms — and they act a little differently. Some types will resolve in a few weeks with treatment, while other cases are chronic and need constant management. But you\\'re not alone. There are solutions as well as ways to keep it under control.Facial eczema can be itchy, flaky, and frustrating — your face is usually the first thing people see — and with so many types of eczema to parse through, it can be overwhelming. To help, we spoke with several board-certified dermatologists to find out what exactly constitutes facial eczema, what triggers the condition, and most importantly, how to keep symptoms at bay.Meet the experts:Macrene Alexiades, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center of New York in New York City.Hadley King, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Anthony Rossi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Neil Sadick, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Adam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C.Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Read MoreBody & Mind GuideSymptoms, treatment options, and personal experiences for various physical, mental, and health conditions and concerns.ArrowIn this story:What Is Facial Eczema?Causes of Facial EczemaHow to Prevent Facial EczemaHow to Treat Facial EczemaShould I Treat Facial Eczema Differently Than I Would Eczema on My Body?What Should I Do if Over-The-Counter Products Aren\\'t Cutting It?What Is Facial Eczema?\"Eczema is an inflammation of the skin caused by either an allergen or irritant,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Anthony Rossi, MD. It can also be genetic, and triggered by irritants.Facial eczema has many different symptoms that can manifest themselves differently from person to person, but some common things to look for are red patches, itchy skin, stinging, and dryness. With darker skin tones, it also tends to be scaly, says Dr. Rossi.Eczema is a common condition that can appear anywhere on the body, but if you\\'re grappling with facial eczema, it\\'s likely on the eyelids, eyebrows, cheeks, or chin. And while it is common, you definitely should bring it to your dermatologist. \"Eczema that develops near the eyes needs special attention because the eyes themselves can be affected,\" adds Dr. Alexiades. \"Those with eczema around the eyes are more susceptible to certain eye problems such as conjunctivitis, inflamed cornea, and changes in the shape of the cornea, a condition called keratoconus.\"Causes of Facial EczemaThere are a few different types of facial eczema — which will be key in not just identifying what you\\'re dealing with, but how you treat it. The most common type of facial eczema is atopic dermatitis. \"Atopic dermatitis is genetic and flares can be triggered by dry environmental conditions, not moisturizing, stress, and allergies,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Hadley King, MD.The second type is contact dermatitis, which comes from exposure to an irritating substance or something you may be allergic to (common perpetrators are cosmetics, dyes, soaps, detergents, fragrance, or smoke — in addition to environmental allergens like pet dander or pollen). \"Some people break out in an eczema rash after eating certain foods, such as nuts, shellfish, milk, and eggs,\" says Dr. Alexiades.Try to note when you see an eczema flare and note any common denominators to your dermatologist. This should help both you and your dermatologist narrow it down and get to the root cause.How to Prevent Facial EczemaThe best way to prevent eczema on the face is the most obvious but perhaps the most important method: identify the trigger and remove it. \"For example, if you notice red patches when you wear jewelry, you may be allergic to nickel. Stop wearing jewelry and your eczema may go away,\" says Dr. Alexiades. \"If you notice red itchy patches after a night out, it may be perfume that is your trigger, in which case stop wearing fragrances and look for fragrance-free cosmetics.\"The same goes for cosmetics and skincare. \"Know what’s in your skincare and if you’re prone to allergies,\" says Dr. Rossi. It may be beneficial to go on a \"product diet.\" Pare down your routine to one gentle product (a cleanser is a good place to start) and add them back in slowly, one by one, to see if you can identify which product is causing your facial eczema. Patch testing—applying a small amount of a product to the sensitive skin on the inside of the arm to see if there is a reaction within 24 hours—can also help to narrow things down.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf you find that your flare-ups happen when you\\'re stressed, you may need to identify some lifestyle changes like taking on fewer projects, getting more rest, or finding more time for mindfulness. Likewise, if you notice that your facial eczema gets worse in dry or hot weather, try to plan ahead for AC breaks, come prepared with sunscreen, and find a thicker and more reliable moisturizer that can hang on all day.How to Treat Facial EczemaSometimes, simply removing your facial eczema triggers will totally cure your skin within weeks. But if your facial eczema is very severe and you can\\'t identify any bad actors, you may want to try over-the-counter hydrocortisone or get a topical steroid prescription from your dermatologist. \"A topical corticosteroid cream will help treat any of the causes of facial eczema,\" says Dr. King. “Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects.” They can be used as needed to treat flares but not for ongoing maintenance, according to the National Eczema Association, since prolonged use can cause withdrawal side effects like red, irritated skin and pimple-like papules.Dr. Rossi adds that antihistamines can be an effective short-term solution if the eczema is caused by an allergen. Otherwise, \"there are more systemic medications for severe or widespread cases,\" he says.How to Curb Flare-upsNot all types of eczema have a surefire \"cure,\" but you can definitely make it more manageable and lessen your flare-ups. You may be able to curb irritation with good lifestyle habits, over-the-counter products, and consistent skincare with gentle but moisturizing products.\"Good, gentle care of your skin is the most important aspect of treating facial eczema,\" says Dr. Alexiades, who recommends fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products if you find that you’re prone to flare-ups. \"Consider a mild cleanser and wash your face with lukewarm water, since heat can cause a flare-up.\"Dr. Alexiades also touts the benefits of keeping your skin hydrated. She recommends moisturizers with emollient ingredients like ceramides and cosmetics that also have moisturizing ingredients. \"Having facial eczema doesn’t mean you can never wear makeup, but not all products are the same,\" she says. \"Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and shea butter.\" Moisturizers and cosmetics with moisturizing ingredients (like hyaluronic acid and shea butter) can help to protect the outer skin barrier—which can be damaged or compromised by eczema, according to the National Eczema Association.Should I treat facial eczema differently than I would eczema on my body?Yes. Both Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, and Dr. Sadick recommend using milder products on your face because the skin is thinner and more sensitive than the skin on your body. \"I would use eczema skin-care products designed for face and body respectively as they contain different concentrations of active ingredients,\" says Dr. Sadick.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesAdam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., recommends using weaker topical steroids, as he says, \"facial skin is more sensitive to the skin thinning and lightening effect of topical steroids.\" According to a study by the National Eczema Association, prolonged use of strong topical steroids can cause a host of withdrawal symptoms once you stop using the cream—like burning, stinging, papules, or pimple-like bumps. However, short-term use is safe and effective with the guidance of a dermatologist.What should I do if over-the-counter products aren\\'t cutting it?Sadly, sometimes eczema on the face can prove extremely stubborn to the point where treatment may need to be prescribed by a doctor. \"If home treatments are not helping, you may need prescription medications,\" says Dr. Shah. \"I usually prescribe either a topical steroid or a topical calcineurin inhibitor, a non-steroidal medication that can reduce inflammation and treat eczema.\"Dr. Shah says she sometimes prescribes special moisturizers called barrier repair creams for patients. And if the eczema is severe and not responding to topical treatments, other options include phototherapy, aka light therapy. There\\'s a wide range of treatment options for facial eczema, so it often comes down to trial and error in order to figure out what works for you. We\\'d recommend always consulting your dermatologist before trying anything new.Read more about caring for skin conditions:6 Skin-Care Ingredients to Add to Your Routine If You Have EczemaHow to Treat Scalp Eczema, According to DermatologistsWhy Colloidal Oatmeal Should Be Part of Your Skin-Care RegimenYou can follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on all things beauty.', 'The 2022 Met Gala is here and back on the first Monday of May. This year, celebrities were challenged with the theme, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion,\" with an emphasis on gilded glamour. Tonight, stars are showing how they\\'re channeling the essence of the Gilded Age with black gowns, lengthy nails, and extravagant headpieces.The vintage waves and slicked-back chignons may be nice, but headpieces are the star of the show at this year\\'s version of the fashion event — and rightfully so. Simple headwear like bedazzled tiaras and golden headbands made their appearance alongside elaborate fascinators and massive hats. It\\'s clear that head coverings are key to the gilded glamour theme, and here are some of our favorite ones.Flaming DiscsGetty ImagesLa La Anthony arrived earlier in the night in a burgundy two-piece with a swirly manicure and a large red headpiece that captured our attention. On one side, there\\'s a large circular piece with red ovular pieces woven together. But, on the other side, the headpiece looks completely different — large and small candy apple-red roses shine, bringing this all-over red ensemble together.Hint of PinkGetty ImagesSarah Jessica Parker took our breaths away and clearly understood the gilded glamour assignment with her black-and-white Christopher John Roberts gown and detailed fascinator. This black netted piece covers part of her face, but it gets even better as your eyes travel up. Rolled pieces of black mesh pop out at the top alongside numerous strings with tiny diamond pieces in black and white. The fuchsia flower and leaves add a touch of color to this look that just makes sense.Abstract HaloGetty ImagesWinnie Harlow stepped on the carpet in a short abstract white dress topped with an intricate white-and-golden headpiece that we can\\'t quite describe. There\\'s thin golden rods that flow from the back of her head connecting to the clear-and-white, sharp abstract pieces that curl out from the sides of her head. This piece almost reminds us of the legs of an insect.Covered in SilverGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThis is far from the first headpiece Janelle Monáe has worn on the red carpet, and it won\\'t be the last one we ooooh and ahhhh over. The black-and-silver, striped hood connects to her bedazzled gown, which is the same color, and covers her entire head. It\\'s the epitome of glamour and excellence.Tiny TiarasGetty ImagesEmma Chamberlain was in the salon for hours the day before the Met Gala to achieve this light platinum blonde hair. Her blunt bob was parted down the middle and tucked behind her ears with a silver bedazzled tiara. This tiara isn\\'t in-your-face, but the delicate piece matches her studded accessories well.Pieces of GoldGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesTommy Dorfman made a statement with her hunter green, latex dress with black leather gloves. The small golden headband on her head complements the gold pieces on her cut-out dress. Tiny squarish shapes are all over the top of the headband.Birds of a Feather Getty ImagesQuannah Chasinghorse always brings her culture wherever she goes. For the Met Gala, she paired a large feather headpiece with a voluminous, baby blue tulle dress. The feathers were attached to intricate braids on one side of her head and look stunning with her jewelry.Bathed in WhiteGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesCynthia Erivo\\'s towering white headwrap references the Tignon Laws, which was a law in the late 1800s that forced Black women to cover their hair. The white wrap is also an ode to the many types of headwraps Black women wear around the globe. We\\'re loving the height and volume of this chalk-white headpiece.Wide BrimsGetty ImagesSZA was clearly embracing the saying \"go big or go home,\" with her hot pink gown, a massive black hat, and latex gloves and thigh-high boots. The sheer size of this hat was impressive, and we would love to know if it stayed put the whole night or if she had to take it off to avoid accidentally hitting someone. At the back of the hat is a fuzzy boa that reached below the singer\\'s waist.Sequins GaloreGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSequins and gems had a huge moment at the 2022 Met Gala. Jessica Chastain decided to shine in a long-sleeve, garnet gown with a silver snake that wrapped around the dress. She paired the look with a turban headband in the same red sequins as the dress for a matchy-matchy moment. The hair accessory also has a silver element with a jeweled brooch at the very center of her head — it\\'s lavish, glitzy, and flashy, which is apt for the glamourous theme.Netted VisionGetty ImagesClaire Danes\\'s slicked-back bob was accessorized with a black fascinator that covered most of her face and ears. This netted design was on the simpler side and almost looked like a bunch of small soda plastic rings woven together.One KnotGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesLily Aldridge is another celebrity who matched her entire outfit from head to toe. Her gown, gloves, and headscarf all had the same silver-studded black design. The bejeweled scarf was tied simply right below her neck for a chic but simple look.Golden GloryGetty ImagesNatasha Poonawalla did not skimp out on any gold on the red carpet. Her brown gown was covered in sequins and accessorized with several large gold pieces of jewelry. She even added a golden headband full of multicolored jewels in different sizes. But the main attraction was the golden corset-like piece that extends into a large headpiece. Three thin metal pieces formed a trio of circles around her head and neck, covering a portion of her face. Shorter pieces of gold curl outward on the rings matched the swirly metal on her chest area.With a TiltGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNormani arrived in a velvet black two-piece set with a brand new hair color.

On June 15, the icon announced that her seventh album, titled Renaissance, is dropping on July 29. Even though she alerted her fans of the upcoming music a month in advance — a striking difference from when she released her self-titled album in 2013 without any promotion — she still made sure to keep us on our toes by sharing the exciting news in the middle of the night and appearing on the July cover of British Vogue just a few hours later.This cover is nothing short of magnificent — and the Beyhive agrees. The \"Spirit\" singer looks like royalty sitting on top of a horse in an all-black Maison Alaia gown with a massive feather headpiece. The rest of the photo shoot is just as breathtaking and extravagant. In one image, she appears in another black outfit but with a leather jacket, black box braids that hairstylist Jawara twisted into what looks like Bantu knots, and a glossy black lip, painted by her longtime makeup artist, Sir John. She looks like the baddest person to ever live sitting on top of a motorcycle instead of a horse.The hair and headpieces were clearly a focal priority in this shoot. They are striking, futuristic, and risky. In a few photos, she has dark hair instead of her usual blonde-highlighted strands, which is making some fans wonder if Queen Bey will be returning to her brunette era for this new album.Getty ImagesBut there is one other hairstyle that is sparking some strong reactions from the Beyhive. The hairstyle in question is the choppy baby fringe she wears with a gilded Schiaparelli Haute Couture outfit and jewelry. These short bangs are far from Beyonce\\'s norm and took several Twitter fans back to 2014, one of the few other times we have seen her with baby bangs.If you don\\'t remember that fringe, let me jog your memory for a second — they were thick, very blunt, and super short, stopping several inches about her forehead. She wore similar bangs in her \\'60s-inspired music video for \"Why Don\\'t You Love Me,\" which was released four years prior. She also had a pair of those stubby bangs in a brunette shade in her \"Telephone\" music video with pop star Lady Gaga.screenshot of Beyoncé from “Telephone” video\\nCourtesy of UMG/InterscopeA few fans noted how the resurgence of these bangs indicated that the Houston singer\\'s upcoming music is about to be epic.One user tweeted side-by-side photos of the spiky bangs and her baby fringe from 2014 and, \"Beyoncé is NOT playing she brought the choppy bangs out.\" Another fan compared the two photos and commented, \"Beyoncé even resurrected the chopped and screwed bangs.

Another jokingly noted that the fringe was probably styled by one of her five-year-old twins. \"I love that Beyoncé always includes her kids in her work, the fact that she got rumi and sir to cut her bangs/style her hair,\" the tweet reads.Regardless of your feelings about the baby fringe, we\\'re sure you\\'re more than excited for the upcoming album — we definitely are. Some fans are thinking it\\'s going to include disco and house influences due to rumors about artists she is collaborating with and the overall vibe of the shoot; it blends retro elements, such as a giant disco ball and platform boots, and futuristic designs. We won\\'t fully know until July 29, but we\\'re sure that Beyoncé will deliver hits as she always has.Read more stories about bangs:21 Types of Bangs to Consider If You\\'re Ready to Take the PlungeBottleneck Bangs Are the New, Daintier Take on Curtain BangsYour Guide to Styling, Maintaining, and Growing Out Curtain BangsNow enjoy this pro-dancers entire daily routine:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'In our humble opinion, nothing beats the rush of getting a needle poked through your skin for a piercing. Among the various ways to express yourself through body modification, they\\'re relatively low risk and just plain ol\\' fun.Piercing trends tend to ebb and flow. Some locations, like the ear lobe, seemingly never go out of style while other placements, like the belly button, resurge in popularity every few years or so. The COVID-19 pandemic affected many folks\\' ability to get piercings as mask-covered areas became off-limits. But, as tattoo and piercing shops open back up, more people have been willing to experiment, whether it\\'s by adding new jewelry to old holes or getting something entirely new.We chatted with a few piercers to learn about all the ear and body piercing trends you should expect in the new year. Here are the piercing trends you\\'ll be seeing everywhere in 2022.Ear CurationsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyThe ear is a popular site for piercings, but recently more folks are seeking out ear curations, according to piercer Amber Maysonet who works at Live by the Sword Tattoo. \"It\\'s basically a mapping and planning for either now or future piercings for your ears,\" she explains. Ear curations involve giving the piercer the creative freedom to choose multiple piercings for you while taking into account your aesthetic and your ear\\'s anatomy to figure out the best placements and jewelry. Sometimes these curations also involve adding new jewelry to already existing piercings to ensure everything works together.Maysonet cites social media, especially TikTok, as the reason why she thinks more people are choosing these curations. \"When you look at [these piercings], especially on social media, you see how good everything goes together and how nice [they] look on somebody else, obviously you\\'re like, \\'OMG, I can do that,\\'\" she shares.At Brooklyn\\'s So Gold Studies, piercer and founder Cassi Lopez-March requires that clients have at least three existing piercings and be willing to get one to three additional piercings during an ear curation session. She finds that more of her clients are seeking out \"full-blown ear styling\" rather than coming in with pre-determined placements because the average person does not always know what they want. \"When someone gives us free reign to kind of have fun with it, that\\'s when the magic happens,\" she shares.OrbitalsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyIf you google \"orbital piercing,\" you\\'ll see a couple of different piercing locations, but don\\'t let the internet confuse you, Cassi Lopez-March says. \"An actual orbital is just one ring that connects two holes,\" she explains. You can get two new piercings or use new jewelry to connect older ones. She has noticed this placement becoming extremely popular with clients who want to refresh their old holes and give them a new life. At her shop, they tend to add orbitals to the lobe area to connect second or even third piercings.NavalCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2017, I fulfilled one of my childhood dreams of getting a belly button piercing. I remember a friend of mine was a bit shocked that I chose the location given that it was no longer \"popular.\" But it looks like I may have been ahead of the curve (and honestly, I don\\'t make my decisions on trends alone) because both Maysonet and Lopez-March see a resurgence in belly rings coming soon.Just like fashion and beauty trends, nostalgia is winning once again with piercings, seeing as belly rings had their last heyday in the 2000s. But Maysonet has seen folks adding a bit of a twist to the placement by getting both the top and bottom of their bellies pierced rather than choosing just one or the other.Flat HelixCourtesy of Instagram/@studsFolks are becoming more interested in receiving multiple piercings at once rather than just one. \"Right now, I think the piercing trends of 2022 are being influenced by the excitement and relief of returning to travel, celebrations, and concerts with new trends of bold self-expression,\" Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of piercing studio Studs where they focus exclusively on ear piercings, shares. That\\'s why she predicts that a trio of piercings on the flat helix will be big in the new year.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe flat helix is specifically the flat area of cartilage located in the upper ear. Bubbers says it\\'s a great spot because you can try out a few different types of jewelry options and have fun with customization. She\\'s also noticed an increase in asymmetrical placements, which can be done in this area.EyebrowGetty ImagesRecently, we\\'ve noticed certain celebrities with new eyebrow piercings — some fake, some real. On September 27, Lil Nas X showed off his new eyebrow piercing on TikTok to fans\\' praise. (Since then we haven\\'t really seen it make another appearance, so who knows if the jewelry was just a fake-out.)Cardi B debuted her own eyebrow piercing during Paris Fashion Week in one of the best ways possible. She showed out in an extravagant red Mugler dress and cape with bedazzled red brows and a silver ring through her left eyebrow. The eyebrow was a popular piercing location in the \\'90s and 2000s, and it seems like it will be reentering the mainstream in 2022.Snakebites/StacksCourtesy of Instagram/@ileanastabbedmeMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2019, Studs created their signature \"Snakebite\" piercing, which model Kaia Gerber helped make popular. The name may be a bit confusing if you\\'re used to the Snakebite lip piercing — which typically means two piercings spaced out at each outer corner of the lower lip — but this is an ear piercing that involves stacking two holes close together on the outer cartilage of the mid-ear area. Bubbers says they expect to see folks trying the piercing in new places like the Forward Helix and Conch in 2022.The jewelry in these holes is just as important as the piercings themselves. Scrolling through Studs\\'s Instagram, you\\'ll see ears full of these Snakebite piercings with gold and silver jewelry in all shapes and sizes.NosesCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMaysonet has also seen an increase in nose piercings, both on the nostril and the septum. She cites the resurgence of punk, alternative, and even scene aesthetics as the impetus for this rise. We\\'re also willing to bet that once mask mandates are lifted in certain areas that it will allow more people to finally try the piercing placement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesYou can get a simple septum or nostril piercing or go all out and try two piercings, whether that be with one hole in each nostril, two holes in one nostril, or a septum and nostril piercing. It\\'s up to you to decide what kind of fun you\\'re into.With the unpredictability of the past two years, there\\'s truly no knowing what will happen in the piercing world. But we are sure that more and more folks will continue to dip into creativity and give their piercer freedom to guide them along their piercing journey.Read more stories about body modification:Contraconch Piercings Are Gaining Popularity For Their Unexpected PlacementYour Complete Guide to Vulva PiercingsHow Your Belly Button Piercing Changes When You Get PregnantNow watch 100 years of piercings:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'It almost felt like the MTV VMAs were back to their pre-pandemic form tonight at the 2022 show. Nicki Minaj, LL Cool J, and Jack Harlow hosted and kept us entertained throughout the music-filled night. Minaj was even awarded the 2022 VMA Video Vanguard award, both exciting and well deserved. In addition to these three celebs, Lizzo, Bad Bunny, and Anitta all blessed the stage with their voices.The performances were amazing, and our eyes were zoned in on what these stars were wearing from head to toe, both on and off the stage. They were already wowing us with their massive feather headpieces, face jewelry, and slicked-back hair, but we were also obsessing over all the manicures. Here are just a few that we are loving.Dove CameronGetty ImagesDove Cameron went for dark grunge vibes at the awards show. She paired her strapless leather and floral gown with smoked-out burgundy eye makeup, plum glossy lips, and stiletto-shaped nails.

For example, there were deep red rose charms and silver gems on each middle finger. If you look closely, you might have noticed the black scissor decals on each ring fingernail.Betty WhoGetty ImagesThe Australian-born singer-songwriter showed up with black-and-white graphic nails. Each hand had different nail designs. On one hand, there were various sizes of white and black stars on each nail. The other hand had white hearts on the index and ring fingers. The white design on the middle finger was actually an ode to the awards show; it\\'s the iconic MTV logo.Monét X ChangeGetty ImagesMonét X Change had already caught over eyes with her large afro puffs and bright tropical-inspired makeup, but we made sure not to forget her white swirly tips.

Her bedazzled metallic nails practically blend into her dress in the above photo. The medium-length, almond-shaped nails were full of sparkly gems and jewels.Lil Nas XGetty ImagesNow, hearing the words \"goth Big Bird\" probably sounds like the strangest and worst thing in the world, but we swear Lil Nas X\\'s VMAs outfit will make you rethink that. The rapper showed out with a massive black feather headpiece with matching pants. It\\'s hard to take your eyes off this elaborate feather piece, but the mismatched manicure he wore that night also deserves some fanfare.OPI Nail Lacquer in Bubble Bath$11OPI Nail Lacquer in Black Onyx$11Two nails on each hand were painted completely black by nail artist Temeka Jackson who used OPI GelColor polishes, which are exclusively available to nail artists, to complete this look. Thankfully, the two shades she used, Bubble Bath (pale pink) and Black Onyx (pitch black), are available in nail lacquer form, so this look can be recreated at home. With the Black Onyx polish and a thin brush, she drew French tips, geometric shapes, and lines to create the nail art.Becky GGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesBecky G looked gorgeous in a sequined gown that looked just like a stained glass window.

The different clips stitched together show the model in a pink velvet bathing suit (ah, a true sign of an L.A. winter) with frosty pink eye makeup and matching pink butterfly clips pulling her hair back from her face.\"Todays vibe,\" the nonchalant caption reads, along with a couple of emojis. Throughout the video, Bieber smiles and makes duck faces while she shows off her look. Her hair is middle-parted and styled with natural beach waves and baby braids. As for makeup, she\\'s opted for layered pink eye shadow: a lighter shade on her inner lids, and a darker hue on her outer lids. Pink glitter serves as her eyeliner, which rims both lash lines and extends outward into a baby wing. The monochromatic look also features a rosy blush, a pink lip color, and soft highlighter on her cheek bones. We\\'re taking notes, and plan on channeling this look all spring long.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.For her nails, she\\'s staying on-trend with a classic French oval manicure so simple that it doesn\\'t take away from her finger tattoos.

She\\'s wearing a few necklaces, including mixed and matched pearls with a custom letter bead necklace (although we can\\'t read what it spells out), two belly chains, and gold hoop earrings.We love all of Hailey\\'s content (shout-out to her skin-care tips, pictures with Justin, and TikTok dances), but we can\\'t get enough of her glowing beauty looks, either.

And while it's all too common for some to slouch when it comes to following the theme of the night, one guest nailed it in the gilded glamor department at the 2022 Met Gala. Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers. It was shiny gold and covered in ruby and pearl-looking appliqués. She also sported a gold, armor-esque covering on her other pointer finger. The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore. Somehow, it was both a retro and futuristic look all at once. And one that set the hearts of internet critics aflame.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.King kept the rest of her beauty look simple, with cropped hair and minimal-looking makeup. Because why take attention away from the nail situation?

If that wasn\\'t enough, the \"Kiss Me More\" singer made our jaws drop with the stunning Schiaparelli black gown and gold accessories she wore for the awards show. By now we expect the pop star to capture our attention with every new look, but we didn\\'t expect her to show up to the event with short nails or intricate gold rings that look like they\\'re worth more than my student loans.The \"Say So\" singer didn\\'t hesitate to take risks for this look, something we love from her. Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas gave her a neutral smokey eye with a hint of bright yellow on the inner crease and waterline that complemented the daring gown very well. As for her hair, hairstylist Jared Henderson (known as JStay Ready to many) slicked her dark hair into a high ponytail with a flipped end that we have a good feeling was fun to whip around.Getty ImagesTypically Doja Cat wears lengthy nails, but for this look, she kept them short. Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe. But this manicure is anything but simple, because this opulent jewelry is basically nail art.Her middle finger had the largest ring, which covered her entire finger and nail. The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own. The other two rings were simpler, which is saying something.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one!

The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me.

One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade. As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says.

As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says.

Yep, it\\'s equally as disappointing when you find an eye-catching set of earrings only to find it\\'s made of materials that could irritate your skin. Sure, they say pain is beauty, but when that pain involves itchiness, redness, and uncomfortable rashes (on an already-thin and sensitive part of your skin, no less), it begs the question: \"were these hoops really worth it?\" The short answer is, well, no.And remember: you\\'ll know if your piercing is infected if it\\'s red, inflamed, sore, hot to touch, or if it\\'s releasing puss. You should consult with your physician if you suspect you have an infection.The truth is, if you\\'re someone who struggles with finding earrings that won\\'t cause discomfort, you may have to work a little harder to find your match. \"Unfortunately, sterling silver jewelry is made with a mix of metals, often nickel, which is the most significant irritant to sensitive ears,\" explains Ottawa-based medical director of Concept Medical Samuel Hetz, MD. \"Those with sensitive ears want to find hypoallergenic rhodium-plated jewelry with low to no nickel content.\" He recommends looking for the standard benchmarks of 14k gold or above as well as sterling silver 925 grade to reduce the chances of nickel content.Because we don\\'t believe those with sensitive skin should be left out of the party, we rounded up nine of the best earrings for sensitive ears that are always stylish, and never irritating.BaubleBar Sutara 18K Gold Earrings$48 at BaubleBar$42 at NordstromFor sensitive-skinned folks, Baublebar\\'s Sutara Earrings will make you thank your lucky stars they\\'re made out of 18k gold.

All around me were people filling in or touching up their ink, but I continued onward past the buzzing needles — straight to the back, where the piercer works. After a tough year, I was ready for a bit of body modification to memorialize the challenges and symbolize the jump forward into 2022. What I didn\\'t realize, as I asked for a third lobe piercing to continue to build my stack of hoops, is that my bright idea was of a pace with a wide new piercing trend.More and more customers are asking for what Alaina Rothstein, cofounder of Los Angeles ear piercing service Leo West, refers to as a \"milestone piercing.\" Rothstein has seen mothers and daughters come in for birthday piercing; she knows of a woman who miscarried and got a stud to remind her of the loss. \"It\\'s a fun, really beautiful way to carry something special with you in happy times and in sad times,\" she says. \"And I think it\\'s like super cool that it\\'s translated [from the tattoo world] into the piercing world.\"Our piercers have seen birthdays, bachelorette parties, and groups of friends come in to celebrate together. But what trends are they trying, specifically? In other words, which parts of the ear are getting the most adoration through adornment right now?Meet the experts:Alaina Rothstein and Jill Katz, RN, cofounders of Los Angeles ear-piercing service Leo WestLisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a piercing studio with locations in New York, Texas, and California (among others)Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer at Live by the Sword Tattoo in Brooklyn, New YorkIn This Story:Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?How to Pick Your PiercerConstellation PiercingsStacked LobesVertical StacksForward HelixSnakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)ConchOuter Conch, a.k.a. SconchJump ahead, or read on for everything you need to know about the freshest ear-piercing trends, as well as the estimated length of time the healing process may take.Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?Milestones are one reason customers are flocking to their local licensed piercer, but another is a generalized sense of freedom and autonomy that\\'s arrived as a result of the pandemic. \"With remote work and workplace norms overall changing, more people are feeling free to experiment with bolder looks and express their personality,\" says Lisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a national piercing studio. That experimentation shows up both in the amount of piercings and in the piercings themselves, which are getting \"more creative,\" Bubbers says. (Plus, as Rothstein points out, \"one fun thing about mask-wearing is that your ears show.\")The last \"really important trend,\" as Leo West cofounder Jill Katz, RN describes it, is \"adorning what you got.\" There\\'s no normal, she says. A gorgeous earscape is all about working with your budget and your anatomy to create an embodiment of your style in tiny, beautiful silver, gold, or gem form.The result: forward helices, vertically stacked lobes, conches, sconches, snake bites, and plenty of other piercing types we never knew existed, spanning from the outer rims of the ear to the inner cartilage and back to the earlobe. Our trend-spotting piercers shared the adornments they\\'ve seen grow more popular over 2022, and what they envision for the years (and ears!) to come.How to Pick Your PiercerJust as with microblading, filler, or any other body modification, it\\'s important to find a professional piercer that you trust, with a style that appeals to you. This is an essential step, whether you’re a longtime body modification fan or it’s your first piercing ever.As Brooks notes, the benefit of following a piercer on social media is that you can seek them out and, as in one service she offers, put your ear(s) in her hands. During a \"curation\" appointment, the expert will look at your ear as a whole and help design multiple piercings to fit your style and your desires.At Leo West, that might look like getting multiple differentiated piercings on each ear. \"Symmetry is out,\" says Rothstein. As she points out, a specialist is extra helpful if you\\'re nervous about curating an asymmetrical look. \"It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t want ears that match, but it has to have a rhyme or reason to it,\" she says. \"I have two ears, and I like to say ‘one’s a little bit classy, one\\'s a little bit sassy.\\'\"Constellation PiercingsInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhile some of this year\\'s trends include holes in unexpected places, more of them involve third, fourth, or fifth additions to an already-pierced ear. At Leo West, the result is what they\\'ve named a \"constellation.\" A constellation consists of \"really small pieces, close together, closer than what your traditional spacing would be,\" explains Rothstein. The result is an \"intentionally random\" grouping of ear piercings that show off studs and gems.Stacked LobesInstagram user @leowestco\"People often come in [to the studio] and say \\'I’m not cool enough,\\'\" for a trendy piercing, recounts Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer in Brooklyn. If you\\'re intimidated by the thought of a conch piercing or even a constellation, Brooks thinks that an ear stack is an easier entry point. These piercings are less painful than their cartilage-filled brethren, and can make their way up the lobe either evenly spaced or placed close together.Vertical StacksInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"If I\\'m being honest, I love to put my hair behind my ear to show the little pops of pieces sitting right above your classic [piercing],\" laughs Rothstein. She\\'s referring to a vertical stack, which entails a piercing centered directly above your traditional first or second hole. It\\'s usually filled with a small stone or a small star, Rothstein\\'s favorite. This piercing does require a certain amount of space on the lobe, but if you have enough canvas to play with, it \"gives the ear a little extra uniqueness.\"Forward Helixcourtesy of StudsThe official name for that bouncy piece of cartilage where your ear meets your skull is the \"forward helix.\" According to Bubbers, customers are coming in requesting one or even multiple piercings on the forward helix. \"We do see new and different piercing trends emerge each year based on what’s trending in fashion, culture, and celebrity,\" she says. Celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Chantal Jeffries have helped popularize the new (and finicky — helix piercings can take up to nine months to heal) style.Snakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)In the realm of body piercing, the term \"snakebite\" typically refers to two piercings on either side of your lower lip, oftentimes barbells or studs.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen it comes to ears, however, it entails two holes placed close together, slightly separated from the rest of your ear piercings, giving the impression of that your piercer just might have used two fangs to get the job done. According to Bubbers, most customers opt for a snakebite in their “midi,\" the center point of the outer ear.ConchInstagram user @leowestcoWe\\'ve named conch piercings as of-trend for the past few years, but the cartilage piercing is still popular enough to remain on the list. It pierces through the inner-ear cartilage that makes up the back of the year. At Studs, Bubbers says customers are opting more and more for a snakebite on the conch for a doubly trendy effect.Outer Conch (Sometimes Known as a \"Sconch\")courtesy of Studs\"I hope you don\\'t use this name,\" laughs Brooks. She prefers the more medical-sounding \"outer conch,\" but the phrase \"sconch\" is catching on to describe a piercing placed at the lining ridge in the cavern space close to the center of the ear.\"It\\'s right in your eye-line when people look at you,\" she says, so it provides a way to show a bit of personality even when you\\'re on Zoom or wearing a mask. Because it\\'ll be eye-catching no matter what kind of earring(s) you have in, Brooks likes adorning an outer conch piercing with a piece of jewelry that makes a big statement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesMore on the world of piercings:How Tongue Piercings Work, From Pain Level and Placement to Aftercare and Healing TimeHow to Remove Every Type of Piercing at Home8 Types of Ear Piercings, ExplainedContraconch Ear Piercings Are Gaining Popularity for Its Unexpected PlacementIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?

That way, I have a scent memory anchored to that destination or time period for whenever I choose to relive it. My last international trip, to a prestigious wellness resort in Austria for some on-the-ground reporting, demanded a very specific choice: something compact enough to fit in my carry-on without getting tossed by TSA, calming enough to match the vibe of the Alpine oasis, and extra long-lasting so it would last through hikes, meals, and medical treatments without reapplication. Lastly, it would need to smell expensive, because my fellow wellness-seekers would expect as much — but we\\'ll get to that later.After much deliberation, I landed on a luxe new formula that had just hit my desk before my flight: the Jennifer Fisher My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil.My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil$65I was initially surprised that Jennifer Fisher, a jewelry designer beloved by her red carpet clientele and the master behind some of Jennifer Lopez\\'s favorite hoop earrings, had ventured into perfumery. That said, fragrance does feel like a sparkling accessory that amps up any outfit or beauty look, and Fisher wanted her new perfume oil to make a statement for the wearer. \"I want anyone wearing My Scent to feel confident and sexy,\" she tells Allure. “And to smell like a fresh baked cookie.\" Upon first wear, I didn\\'t flag baked goods as a top note, but I did instantly fall for the vanilla and coconut Fisher knew she wanted to include in the formula.\"The blend of vanilla and coconut brings back memories from my childhood growing up in Santa Barbara, California,\" she says. \"For years, I was combining different vanilla and coconut fragrances to try and create my own personal scent. Finding a scent that was a combination of surf wax from the beaches in my hometown, Montecito, and a fresh baked cookie is what I\\'ve always wanted.\"Australian sandalwood, pear, and Tonka bean flank the creamy hero notes, and it all comes together to smell equal parts sunny and cozy, like throwing on a cashmere sweater on a breezy summer night. Toting it around is just as effortless too: I carried the teeny-tiny rollerball in my airplane carry-on, my spa robe to and from massages and lunch, and even in my fanny pack while Nordic walking in the mountains.No, really, I took this tube everywhere with me.\\nTaylore Glynn\"I wanted to come out with something small, compact, and portable you could throw in your bag and take everywhere with you,\" says Fisher. \"A spray to me didn\\'t feel as transportable, but that doesn\\'t mean I am ruling it out for the next product. This oil was designed intentionally to be worn and carried on-the-go.\" In addition to being totable, the formula also fulfilled my need for something that would last through spa treatments and saunas.\"Coconut is a good oil carrier to round out scents,\" says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, noting that scent can last longer in oil form because it\\'s not watered down. \"Atomized scents usually contain alcohol to help spraying. Fragrance oil is the most concentrated form [you can find].\"The scent was so powerful that even my fellow resort guests noticed. In fact, I was flagged down multiple times in the dining room and in the halls to reveal what I was wearing because it smelled \"beautiful\" and \"divine.\" For important context, some of the resort guests on the premises at the time — who I can\\'t explicitly identify — included one of the most famous supermodels of our generation, an Oscar-winning actress, and an entirely different famous jewelry designer with whom I chatted about ketamine therapy. I realized that My Scent smelled flat-out expensive, which seems to be a selling point amongst perfume enthusiasts on social media. In fact, there\\'s a whole genre of #FragranceTok posts dedicated to perfumes that make you smell, well, rich. After studying these videos, there\\'s a handful of perfumes that seem to universally smell like wealth: Parfums de Marly Delina, Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Montale Paris Intense Cafe, and three different Maison Francis Kurkdjian perfumes.Courtesy of brandParfums de Marly Delina$335Courtesy of brandYves Saint Laurent Libre Eau de Parfum Spray$140 $112 at NordstromIntense Cafe Eau de Parfum$170Courtesy of brandMaison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540$325They all also happen to share one intoxicating note: vanilla, which lies at the heart of My Scent.

Well, we say it's time to take a moment to appreciate such bold choices, such as Doja Cat's quirky makeup looks from Paris Fashion week — she still has us wondering how her shirt remained white with all that gold. And we certainly can't leave out the Hadid sisters' bleached brows for their own prance down the very same runways. It's not much of a shocker, then, that Gigi Hadid went for something a bit odd and definitely bold for a recent red-carpet beauty moment. For the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards on November 7, Hadid graced the carpet with an unconventional cool gray lipstick.I'll be the first to admit that I did a double-take at first glimpse. No, it's not your typical choice where a lipstick shade is concerned, but makeup artists Patrick Ta and Akina Shimizu were able to pull off this muted-yet-fresh-faced makeup look on Hadid. Catch me zooming in on those lips that are seemingly matte and glossy at the same time. We're definitely not the only ones hoping the details will soon be dropped on what particular beauty brand this lipstick is made by. Nonetheless, this all-American color pallet is insanely cohesive.Let's also not forget the striking blonde hair color and the sleek, slicked-back bun hair stylist Laura Polko put together to bring out the jewelry on Hadid's ears and nose. My favorite part is the septum ring paired with the tartan-patterned Thom Browne attire styled by Mimi Cuttrell — it's full-on grunge. I'm honestly tempted to break out my alternative pop-rock playlist, like, now.

The supermodel went for a runway-ready vibe for both of her costumes this year, though they were extremely different in tone.For her first look, Bieber covered herself in roses to pay homage to an Yves Saint Laurent haute couture runway look from 1999, originally worn by model Laetitia Casta. In her carousel of pics, Bieber wears a top and miniskirt made of huge pink roses, enhanced by a matching pink organza ruffled train at her hips. Roses also pop up on one ankle and serve as a flower crown atop her head. The look is very The Birth of Venus but make it fashion —and floral.Bieber let the roses be the centerpiece of her costume and kept her hair and makeup subtle and natural with radiant \"glazed\" skin, deep rose lips, and a hint of shimmery pink eye shadow, then finished off the costume with a pale pink and white manicure. She wore no jewelry or accessories other than her engagement diamond and a pair of pale pink ankle-strap sandals. While Casta wore the rose look with Raphaelite ringlet curls, Bieber decided on loose brunette waves for a more modern approach. I just have one question, Hailey: Are those real roses? Hopefully, you de-thorned them if so!Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Later on during Halloweekend, Bieber ditched the angelic florals of her first costume in favor of something darker: a \"Versace Vampire.\" The model donned a strappy black bustier top and high-waisted black skirt with a black and gold Versace logo belt, opera-length shiny black latex gloves, and a pair of vampire fangs for the Goth-inspired vampire moment. A black wig, bright purple eyeshadow, flushed cheeks, and blood-red lips (obviously), plus chunky gold necklaces and huge gold and pearl earrings added to the glamourous \\'90s Versace vibe; she could have walked right off a Gianni Versace runway, minus the fangs.Instagram/Hailey BieberThe two looks may have been complete opposites, but they paid homage to Bieber\\'s fashion roots in the most gorgeously spooky and stunning way.More celeb Halloween looks you may have missed:The Kardashian\\'s Halloween Costumes Included Mystique, Bride of Frankenstein and Jessie from Toy StoryYou Have to See Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly as Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee for HalloweenMegan Thee Stallion Has Outdone Herself in the Halloween Nail Art DepartmentMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNow, learn Hailey\\'s 10 biggest beauty tips:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'TikTok-turned-reality star Dixie D\\'Amelio finally committed to the hairstyle she\\'s been longing for since sixth grade.

You can find plenty of examples across social media. Just look to hashtags #tonguepiercing and #tonguepiercings on TikTok and Instagram, which have over 790 million views and 520,000 posts, respectively.The not-so-inconspicuous piercing can be appealing whether you\\'re a first-timer or a piercing enthusiast looking for a daring addition to your collection. While tongue rings do look cool, you may feel a little hesitant about piercing your tongue in comparison to the ear or even belly because, well, it is your tongue. The stakes seem higher and more dangerous should an infection occur.But despite the location, the aftercare for tongue piercings is actually a lot easier (and a lot less painful) than some would expect. Here\\'s everything you need to know before scheduling your piercing appointment, whether you\\'re undecided about taking the plunge or ready to get your tongue pierced tomorrow.Meet the experts:Jenna Myers, a piercer at Live By the Sword Tattoo in New York CityErich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone HealthLynn Loheide, a body piercer based in Nashville, TennesseeAre tongue piercings dangerous?Before you even think about setting up your appointment, it\\'s important to understand the risks associated with tongue piercings. Like any piercing, there\\'s always a possibility of infection or rejection.Sometimes the signs of infection can be easy to confuse with irritation in piercings, especially if you\\'re extra paranoid. But New York City-based piercer Jenna Myers says that there tends to be a pretty big distinction between the two.\"[With an] infection, your tongue is going to look absolutely wild,\" Myers shares. \"It\\'ll be two to three times the size, turning almost green or white, [with puss].\" When that happens, she always advises going to the ER for professional help. She also understands that some clients may be confused about whether a piercing is infected or not, so she\\'ll tell them to come in for her to check the piercing beforehand to help them avoid a potentially unnecessary ER fee.Erich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone Health, notes that pus, severe tongue swelling, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and difficult breathing indicate that it\\'s time to seek out a medical professional. Typically, infected piercings are usually treated with antibiotics and the removal of jewelry, he explains.But there are some rare cases where surgery might be needed to drain an abscess or deal with any other complications, according to Dr. Voigt. For example, he once had to perform an emergency surgery on a patient because their tongue started to fill with blood and swell, leading them to choke. \"Fortunately, I was able to take the person to the operating room, remove the piercing (which was difficult because half of it became incorporated into the swollen tongue), incise the tongue, tie off a bleeding artery and well as cauterize the muscles, and then suture the tongue back together,\" Dr. Voigt shares.Luckily, not every tongue piercing will become infected. Still, it\\'s important to note that regardless of placement, the piercing can cause damage to the teeth and gums, according to piercer Lynn Loheide and Dr. Voigt. \"You need to understand that going into it, be okay with that risk, and also know what you have to do to minimize that risk,\" Loheide shares.Are horizontal \"snake eyes\" tongue piercings safe?Speaking of placement, there are restrictions as to where the tongue piercing can go. You might have heard of snake eyes before. For those who are unfamiliar, this style typically refers to a horizontal tongue piercing at the tip of the tongue. And if you had hopes of getting that piercing, keep dreaming. Unfortunately, experts say that tongue piercings should only go vertically through the tongue because horizontal placement comes with a big risk of damage to the teeth and gum recession.\"When we\\'re piercing vertically, especially in the center, we\\'re piercing through a connective tissue between those muscles,\" Loheide explains. \"But when you\\'re piercing horizontally, you\\'re actually pinning those muscles together, and that can cause a lot of damage.\" They also note that in the state of Oregon, horizontal tongue piercings are banned for this reason.Can anyone get a tongue piercing?Though everyone\\'s tongue is different, Loheide says if your tongue is too short or you have a tongue-tie — which is basically when the webbing underneath your tongue comes almost or all the way to the tip — a tongue piercing is probably not the best option for you.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen you arrive at your appointment, don\\'t be surprised if the piercer starts analyzing your mouth. In fact, that\\'s a good sign because your unique anatomy will dictate where you can and can\\'t get pierced, and any reputable piercer will ensure to take that into account, Loheide shares.\"We want to see where the blood flow is along the underside of the tongue and make sure that we\\'re not too close to it,\" they explain. \"But we also want to look at the shape of someone\\'s teeth and someone\\'s mouth when we\\'re deciding placement.\" That way, a piercer can ensure that they aren\\'t causing unnecessary damage and that the jewelry won\\'t rub up uncomfortably against your teeth.What can I expect during a tongue piercing appointment?Before your appointment, it\\'s imperative that you brush your teeth and tongue before arriving. Myers shares that typically her clients are given mouthwash right before to help clean their mouths out.As mentioned above, most of your appointment will be spent on prepping and checking your tongue before the needle is inserted. The actual piercing part of the session is short, just like most other piercings — a hollow needle is pushed through the tongue, and then the piercer adds the jewelry, which is a barbell shape.For standard tongue piercings, the ring is usually in the center of the tongue. Though horizontal piercings are a big no-no, you can still get two vertical tongue piercings. Some may call them venom piercings, but Loheide prefers to just refer to them as paired tongue piercings because for some people venom refers to two horizontal piercings, and the slang terms used change over time.\"Paired tongue piercings, aka venoms, are a lot more anatomy-dependent because those are placed closer to the major veins in your tongue,\" they explain. \"So we have to make sure that there\\'s space around that blood flow for them to be placed safely.\"Like any piercing, you should expect pain, and though it\\'s subjective, Loheide and Myers both swear that a tongue piercing is not as bad as you might think. \"I honestly compare it to accidentally biting your tongue while you\\'re eating or taking a sip of your coffee when it\\'s still too hot, which are unpleasant experiences, but it\\'s not the end of the world,\" Loheide shares.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn fact, they say that the most uncomfortable part is having the piercer\\'s hands in your mouth for an extended amount of time. Myers notes that on a scale of one to 10, most of her clients rate standard tongue piercings between a one to three, and paired tongue piercings a three to five.What does aftercare for a tongue piercing look like?There are a few things to expect immediately after your piercing. If you\\'ve been pierced before, some of these won\\'t be too shocking, but there are certain effects that are specific to tongue piercings.Right after your appointment, expect your tongue to be a bit swollen and painful for about one to two weeks, according to Loheide. That\\'s naturally going to happen because the piercing is a fresh wound. In addition to the pain and swelling, you\\'ll also deal with a slight lisp or change in how you speak. \"After about a week, the swelling will go down, and then the rest of the healing process is pretty easy,\" they share.Myers estimates that for a single tongue piercing, it will take about one to three months and three to five for paired piercings. \"Because the tongue is so vascular, it has a lot of blood flow to it, so it heals really quickly,\" she says. On the other hand, Loheide says to expect it to take about three to five months to be fully healed.Thankfully, the aftercare for tongue piercings isn\\'t too complicated. In general, maintaining good oral hygiene — brushing your teeth regularly and flossing — is important. Once you get home, Loheide recommends immediately changing out your toothbrush for a new one and using milder oral hygiene products. They advise avoiding toothpaste with whitening ingredients.Both piercers strongly suggest using an alcohol-free mouthwash that won\\'t burn your mouth. Loheide likes Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse because it doesn\\'t taste as badly as some alcohol-free mouthwashes do, it\\'s affordable, and can be found in most drug stores. Myers also recommends sterile saline solution, which tends to be recommended for most piercings.Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse$10Apart from switching up your oral products, you may have to change what you eat, but only for a short while. Myers suggests avoiding spicy, crunchy, and acidic foods in the first few weeks to avoid irritation. \"Things that you wouldn\\'t [want on] a paper cut, basically, you don\\'t want to eat the first few weeks of a tongue piercing, because it will cause serious discomfort,\" she says.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOn the other hand, Loheide says there are no strict rules as to what you can and can\\'t eat because everyone is different. But you still have to be mindful of how your mouth and tongue feel when you do eat or drink certain things. \"If you go to eat something and you\\'re like, \\'Wow, this feels terrible to eat,\\' don\\'t keep eating it,\" they share.Ultimately, try to not go overboard with your piercing aftercare, because that could potentially case more irritation. \"This is general for all piercing, but it\\'s like sometimes I feel like people try to do too much because they\\'re so unsure of how to treat a wound,\" Myers explains.\" Being as simple as possible with your aftercare is really best. Your body is really good at healing itself.\"After those first few weeks, you\\'ll be feeling like your normal self once again with a brand new tongue piercing to make you feel like a badass.Read more stories about piercings:7 Piercing Trends That Will Be Everywhere in 2022How to Remove Every Kind of Piercing Jewelry at HomeIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?Now enjoy the unboxing of the April 2022 Allure Beauty Box:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'Doja Cat is ready to travel to a galaxy far, far away.

Popularized in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, the timing for this resurgence makes sense: We\\'re already sticking Y2K-inspired rhinestones on our faces, breaking out the frosted eye shadow, and revisiting \"thong jeans\" so low-rise they would make even Paris Hilton blush. It was only a matter of time before bonding Swarovski crystal butterflies to our enamel made a comeback, too.Dental bling may be one of this year\\'s biggest beauty trends, but it\\'s nothing new. Anthropological records show that dentists as far back as the Mayan Empire decorated teeth with jade, gold, and turquoise, according to Anjali Rajpal, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California, nicknamed \"The Diamond Dentist\" on account of the bejeweled designs she creates for her celebrity clientele.Tooth jewelry also has significance in Black culture — a well-known example is grills, which were first worn by West Indian immigrants in the \\'70s and \\'90s hip-hop artists. Grills are decorative covers made of gold, silver, or encrusted with jewels that snap over one or more teeth and are removed at the end of each day. Tooth gems as we know them today differ from grills, but it\\'s important to recognize the cultures they\\'re derived from.Instead of a mouthful of precious metal, tooth gems are usually a single or a few delicate multi-colored gems or diamonds that are bonded individually to the teeth. Pinterest is clearly here for the trend, with the site reporting an 85 percent uptick in searches for \"tooth gems\" last year alone, while TikTok views for the hashtag #toothgems currently stand at 130.4m. \"Tooth gems add a little edge to someone\\'s style and are a less invasive way to make a statement than a tattoo,\" Dr. Rajpal tells Allure.Aesthetics aside, what about the dental health implications of these tiny adornments? We asked experts to share how tooth gems can be applied, and cared for, safely.Meet the Experts:Anjali Rajpal, DMD, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California.Michael Apa, DDS, an aesthetic dentist in New York City.Brian Kantor, DDS, a cosmetic dentist in New York City.How are tooth gems applied?Everyone\\'s bite is different, so there\\'s no avoiding a consultation first – sorry, dentist\\'s orders. \"[A consultation appointment] is also an opportunity to take my client\\'s style and personality into account when collaborating with them for their jewelry design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.If you\\'re choosing a semi-permanent tooth gem, no drilling is required: The technique is similar to the way braces are applied. \"An acidic solution (or etching gel) is placed on the tooth\\'s surface, microscopically roughening the enamel, before the gemstone is bonded to it with an adhesive and curing lamp,\" explains New York City-based aesthetic dentist Michael Apa. The whole process only takes a matter of minutes and is painless, provided the gem is bonded to the surface of a healthy tooth, Dr. Apa says. \"If you\\'ve got worn-away enamel from grinding your teeth or eating too many acidic foods, there will likely be sensitivity,\" he adds.Permanent tooth gems do require drilling a hole in the desired location, so be ready for the commitment if you\\'re planning on getting this adornment because it won\\'t be easy to remove. Also worth noting: While tooth gems can be bonded to veneers, Dr. Apa says they can\\'t be worn with Invisalign.How much do tooth gems cost?There\\'s no one-size-fits-all price tag. The cost will largely depend on your choice of design and materials (a Swarovski crystal, for example, will be cheaper than a diamond). Some dentists charge two separate fees – one for the gemstone and another for the application. \"My in-office fees include both and can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the size, quality, and quantity of the stones and the nature of the design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.How long do tooth gems last?Most tooth gems are semi-permanent and can last anywhere between six months to one year, says Brian Kantor, a cosmetic dentist in New York City. The right aftercare and dental materials used to bond the gemstone to the tooth will help you get the most out of your new dental jewelry.\"For the first 24 hours after getting a tooth gem, you should only eat soft foods and avoid using an electric toothbrush or drinking soda, coffee, or tea to protect the fresh bond,\" says Dr. Kantor, adding that picking or playing with your tooth gem is also off-limits. Sometimes a tooth gem may fall off on its own if you bite down hard on something, but Dr. Kantor says not to worry: \"There\\'s no harm to your tooth if that happens and the gem can simply be re-attached.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSemi-permanent tooth gems can also be safely removed by a dentist if you change your mind or want to switch up the design. “The gem is simply polished off along with any adhesive on the tooth,\" says Dr. Rajpal. As for permanent tooth gems, though, be warned that removing a permanent tooth gem that was inserted into a tooth will leave a hole. \"This hole will then need to be filled in with a white filling material that is color-matched to the existing shade of the tooth,\" adds Dr. Rajpal.Are tooth gems safe?If you ask Dr. Apa, tooth gems are purely an accessory. \"They\\'re a very specific aesthetic choice because they don\\'t offer the restorative benefits that come with veneers or crowns,\" he says. On top of not offering any benefits, there are a few dental risks that come with getting a set of gems.\"Tooth gems can trap plaque and create places for stray food particles and harmful bacteria to hide,\" Dr. Kantor explains. Needless to say, keeping the gem clean and practicing good oral hygiene is essential if you want to avoid gum inflammation, decay, or other dental issues. Alongside regular flossing, Dr. Apa recommends brushing twice a day with a non-abrasive toothpaste and soft bristle sonic toothbrush \"because the vibration offers a deeper clean and dislodges food stuck to the gemstone,\" he says.The bottom line? In general, as long as a dentist applies your chosen gem, and you\\'re taking proper care of your teeth at home, \"the risks are minimal,\" Dr. Apa says. In the wrong hands, he warns you could end up getting a gem with a rough surface that can cause traumatic lesions on the inside of the lip. \"Or if the gem isn\\'t placed properly, you can break an opposing tooth when you bite down,\" he cautions.So, I shouldn\\'t try applying tooth gems at home?Nope! Advice from dentists hasn\\'t stopped folks from taking the DIY route with nail art gems and superglue, but it should. \"It sounds obvious, but nobody should be ingesting toxic glue,\" insists Dr. Rajpal, who prefers to work with biocompatible materials such as gold and precious or semiprecious stones. \"Besides, glue doesn\\'t properly bond the gem to the tooth structure as well as dental materials,\" she explains. \"It\\'s far safer for a tooth gem to be applied by an experienced dentist, using a non-toxic material and polished to avoid any bacterial traps, as it will last longer, be more comfortable and hygienic.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesFor the same reason, Dr. Apa recommends a dentist remove the gem to avoid accidentally stripping away healthy enamel or tooth structure. \"You shouldn\\'t DIY anything in dentistry,\" he says. \"Tooth gem application is a dental procedure, and all procedures should be performed by a professional.\"More stories to take a bite into:I Took on Credit Card Debt to Get Braces as an AdultDentists Reveal the Correct Order to Brush Your Teeth, Floss, and Use MouthwashHow to Deal With Teeth Grinding and Jaw ClenchingNow, see how dental care has evolved over the last 100 years:', 'The 2022 MTV VMAs have barely even begun, and Lizzo is already stealing the show. The \"About Damn Time\" singer arrived at the awards show in an ensemble that was almost as dark as the black carpet she walked on. She looked like she could be princess of the underworld or even a gothic cake topper with her massive navy blue gown, dark lipstick, and golden rings on her ears, fingers, and lips.Where do you even start with a look like this? The singer\\'s navy blue gown was a gorgeous rumpled, off-the-shoulder dress from Jean Paul Gaultier. She paired it with sheer navy blue gloves that covered her forearms.Her golden jewelry was as excessive as her stunning gown in all the best ways possible. On both of her ring fingers, she wore an abstract looped ring. Earrings of various sizes covered her entire cartilage and lobe. The rings along her cartilage were thicker in width but smaller in circumference, so they hugged her ear. The hoops on the lobe were much larger, nearly skimming her shoulders. The last ring lay in the middle of her bottom lip.Getty ImagesThe lip ring combined with the dark blue lipstick and slicked back, wet-looking hair gave this look an edgier vibe that fit right in at the VMAs. Makeup artist Alexx Mayo was responsible for this glam makeup and matte lip. He painted her lips with Charlotte Tilbury\\'s Rock N Kohl liner in Bedroom Black and Eye Colour Magic Liner Duo in Super Blue to create the deep navy blue hue.Hairstylist Shelby Swain, who often works with the pop star, gave Lizzo\\'s wig the wet look using Matrix\\'s Instacure Anti-Breakage Porosity Spray and Vavooom Extra Full Freezing Spray. For the simple baby hairs, Swain used Matrix\\'s Overachiever Paste 3-in-1 Cream to keep the swoops in place.It was hard to see her nails beneath her mesh gloves, but the almond-shaped claws were painted with silver nail polish by nail artist Eri Ishizu. She used OPI\\'s GelColor in Clean State as a base before adding Chrome Effects in Mixed Metals to create an iridescent finish. Those two products are exclusive to nail artist pros, but OPI\\'s Nail Lacquer in Clean Slate and Infinite Shine in Silver on Ice work as replacements.Getty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf this was just her arrival look, we can\\'t wait for what she\\'s going to be wearing on stage when she performs.

The Emily in Paris star may be called \"classic\" or \"glamorous,\" but the actor rarely ventures into the unconventional. And you could argue the same thing about luxury brand Cartier. But apparently, when the two get together, the trendy, off-beat coolness comes out — a Collins\\'s hair is proof.In the new ad campaign for Clash de Cartier, a jewelry collection that strikes a balance between classic and eccentric, Collins does exactly that. We see her in an elegant, asymmetrical black dress and red lipstick, and her brown hair is pulled back into a sleek, low bun, not unlike the style she wore for her wedding — basically exactly how we picture Lily Collins when we picture Lilly Collins.As Billy Idol\\'s \"Dancing With Myself\" plays, she stands in contrast with another version of herself that looks completely out of her beauty comfort zone, yet it somehow works so well.

Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.On Tuesday, Collins teased a preview of the look, giving us a peek at the baby bangs, which appear to have been styled by Gregory Russell. The makeup looks were done by Fiona Stiles, and the manicures by nail artist Thuy Nguyen.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Although Collins recently told us that her curtain bangs are a \"dedicated decision\" that she\\'s wanted to do \"for years but never had the courage to take the plunge,\" it looks like she may be open to trying other, unexpected fringe looks.

Her 29th birthday look has all the elements that define her signature style: inches and inches of hair, super long acrylic nails, and lots of bling.She posted a few photos of the gorgeous birthday look to Instagram on July 4, showing off her mile-long curls nearly as white as snow, pastel purple eye makeup, and baby blue nail design full of iridescent gems. She is seen in a cutout purple dress with her platinum blonde curls cascading over one of her shoulders, the ends almost grazing her knees. Though she tends to switch up her hair color often, she\\'s indulged in her blonde era many times before with this bright hue, just like when she chopped off her hair into a platinum-blonde buzz cut right at the end of 2021.The light hair color pairs beautifully with her lavender cut crease, which also complements her gown perfectly. You\\'d think the light purple shade would also make an appearance on her nails, but not at all. Instead, this stiletto manicure was painted a light blue hue, which feels like an apt choice for the water sign. Each icy blue nail was filled with opalescent jewels of various sizes running straight down the middle.

On the 2022 red carpet, it has come in the form of elaborate headpieces, an overwhelming amount of black attire for a white-tie event, and some very funky hairstyles — especially including that of Alicia Keys.Keys walked the red carpet on May 2 in a black gown, completed by a cape bedazzled with the New York City skyline (how fitting for the singer who wrote the concrete-jungle-wet-dream-tomato song). When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection. When is it not?Getty ImagesThen I caught a look at her long braid from the side and the back and now I'm bewildered by… whatever is in her hair. As you can see below, Keys's braid is — I don't even know what word to use here — woven? Woven with something I'm finding very hard to describe. It's like a black-and-silver ribbon… made out of CDs… bedazzled CDs?Getty ImagesIn short, I have no idea what is going on with this hairstyle or what to call it, but it looks damn good. Then again, Alicia Keys could've rocked up to the Met Gala in a garbage can and she still would've made it look soulfully chic. It's what she does best.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King's Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNeed more?

On the 2022 red carpet, it has come in the form of elaborate headpieces, an overwhelming amount of black attire for a white-tie event, and some very funky hairstyles — especially including that of Alicia Keys.Keys walked the red carpet on May 2 in a black gown, completed by a cape bedazzled with the New York City skyline (how fitting for the singer who wrote the concrete-jungle-wet-dream-tomato song). When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection. When is it not?Getty ImagesThen I caught a look at her long braid from the side and the back and now I'm bewildered by… whatever is in her hair. As you can see below, Keys's braid is — I don't even know what word to use here — woven? Woven with something I'm finding very hard to describe. It's like a black-and-silver ribbon… made out of CDs… bedazzled CDs?Getty ImagesIn short, I have no idea what is going on with this hairstyle or what to call it, but it looks damn good. Then again, Alicia Keys could've rocked up to the Met Gala in a garbage can and she still would've made it look soulfully chic. It's what she does best.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King's Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNeed more?

But, what if I told you there\\'s another radiance-intensifying ingredient that\\'s also a staple in your jewelry box? That\\'s right, I\\'m talking about gold, which is one of the many luminosity-amplifying ingredients in 111Skin\\'s Rose Gold Radiance Booster.111Skin is no stranger to luxury beauty: the brand has started gaining some serious hype from celebs like Kesha and it\\'s become a repeat feature in the Allure Beauty Box for its impressive, skin-nourishing formulations. Even our very own associate features director Dianna Mazzone is a fan of the brand, particularly 111Skin\\'s Vitamin C Brightening Booster. So, I already knew I was in good hands when this fancy-schmancy rose gold bottle first landed on my desk.Courtesy of brandImmediately, I did a quick scan of the label to see if my sensitive, rosacea-stricken skin could handle the formula. The serum contains a few ingredients that are already in my skin-care regimen: hydrating hyaluronic acid, brightening niacinamide, and soothing rosewater. \"The best known effect of rosewater is being anti-inflammatory, which can reduce redness and swelling in the skin,\" Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist James Wang, MD, says of the latter ingredient. \"The hydrating and antibacterial benefits, combined with its ability to calm the skin, can be especially helpful in some patients with inflammatory acne and rosacea.\"But what made me raise my eyebrows in skepticism was the pure gold extract. This may seem like a gimmicky ingredient, but Dr. Wang says that this precious metal can actually have a purpose in your skin-care routine. He notes that gold actually is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and claims of targeting fine lines and wrinkles. \"Although not a fully proven effect, gold is thought to help with wrinkles and signs of sun damage by also boosting collagen production,\" he says. With all of this in mind, Dr. Wang says this ingredient can be irritating to sensitive skin or those allergic to gold, so always patch test this product before applying it to your face.According to the bottle\\'s directions, there are two ways you can use this product: alone after cleansing or mixed into your favorite moisturizer. Whichever path you choose, the brand recommends using one to two drops. I decided to try both avenues of application simply out of curiosity and I\\'ve found that its slippery formula absorbs equally as well, regardless of how you apply it.As for its texture, the Rose Gold Radiance Booster is shimmery and has a slippery feel to it, almost like a champagne-hued version of a snail mucin serum. Once I applied it to my skin, the first thing I noticed was how teensy the gold particles were, which didn\\'t irritate my skin at all. It left a reflective veil of natural-looking shimmer without looking too intense or dramatic, and because of this, I\\'ve been reserving this sparkly serum for my morning skin-care regimen.Jennifer Hussein for AllureSo, is this gold-infused serum really worth the triple-digit price tag? Considering the fact that I\\'ve been using it daily for two months and have seen a major difference in the radiance of my complexion, my answer is a million times over, absolutely. Sure, there are many brightening skin-care products on the market, but as someone who\\'s tested hundreds of these formulations, 111Skin\\'s iridescent serum provided significant results that I haven\\'t achieved with other picks. And, at the very least, it\\'s literally liquid gold for your face, so why not treat yourself to a little luxury?111Skin Rose Gold Radiance Booster$135Want to try it for yourself?

Each design I create is a reflection of who I am.\"Short Nail Art InspirationGrowing up in Texas with family from Mexico City, Goldstein has had a wide variety of influences on her nail designs, the biggest of which was museum art. She developed an appreciation of the techniques of Diego Rivera, the Mexican painter who became Frida Kahlo\\'s husband, the color palette combinations of Josef Albers, the German artist who was the first to get solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art and the Met in New York, and the styles of her grandparents\\' house in Mexico City, which was designed by Architect Luis Barragán.\"I believe Barragán\\'s work is a study of the language of the colors of México,\" she says. \"Being surrounded by a wide palette definitely shaped my understanding of the interplay between colors and how colors affect emotions, which has impacted my designs greatly.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.When it comes to creating designs now, Goldstein uses her own style and life as inspiration. Because she uses her hands for work —through manicures and jewelry design (did we mention she owns two brands, Doublemoss Jewelry and Doublemoss Arte?) —she found that short nails are the most functional.How to Shape Short NailsGoldstein explains that shaping has the biggest impact on creating the illusion of longer nails. She\\'s a big fan of the tapered oval and square shapes but recommends avoiding flat square nails because they can make your nails look shorter. In terms of trends, every design can look good on short nails, Goldstein says, citing French tips and negative space nails as examples, but it\\'s the way the design is styled that matters.\"If you do a thick, flat French tip, it makes your short nail look shorter,\" she says, opposed to a daintier, more curved tip. \"Negative space nails work wonders for shorter nails. A clean sheer base helps minimize the attention on the nail and focus on the art.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Celebrities Who Love Short NailsWhen navigating designs with clients, Goldstein\\'s biggest goal is to make sure the nails complement the entire look, especially when doing celebrity nails for red carpet events (her résumé includes several Met Galas, U.S. press for The Batman, and The Academy of Motion Pictures Museum Opening Gala, but no big deal).Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I never want the nail art to take over,\" she says. \"Nail art is not for everyone, and I like to respect that by never pushing it on any of my clients.\"Goldstein also enjoys how collaborative the nail art process can be, naming her method with Gemma Chan, whose nails she did for the Met Gala in 2019 and 2021 and The Eternals premiere in London, as an example.\"I create a design based on what she is wearing and then consult Gemma for any tweaks or changes,\" she says. \"I love that Gemma isn\\'t scared to take risks with nails and respects the art.\"Goldstein is making major strides in bringing short nails back, and we\\'re obsessed with all of her designs. To sum it all up, we\\'d say she\\'s nailing it.

To be real, anything \"boiling over\" on our face is something we\\'d like to avoid.According to the National Eczema Association, 31.6 million people in the U.S. have some form of eczema, making it one of the most common skin conditions. If you\\'re experiencing red, irritated skin on your face (especially your eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, or chin), there\\'s a fairly good chance it\\'s facial eczema. You may already have it elsewhere on your body, or it could be on your face alone. And while there is no study evaluating the prevalence of facial eczema, specifically, New York City-based dermatologist Neil Sadick, MD, says he believes the disorder affects about a third of the population.With facial eczema, you\\'ll have to do a bit of detective work to identify what\\'s causing it. There are a few types — atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis being the two most common forms — and they act a little differently. Some types will resolve in a few weeks with treatment, while other cases are chronic and need constant management. But you\\'re not alone. There are solutions as well as ways to keep it under control.Facial eczema can be itchy, flaky, and frustrating — your face is usually the first thing people see — and with so many types of eczema to parse through, it can be overwhelming. To help, we spoke with several board-certified dermatologists to find out what exactly constitutes facial eczema, what triggers the condition, and most importantly, how to keep symptoms at bay.Meet the experts:Macrene Alexiades, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center of New York in New York City.Hadley King, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Anthony Rossi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Neil Sadick, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Adam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C.Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Read MoreBody & Mind GuideSymptoms, treatment options, and personal experiences for various physical, mental, and health conditions and concerns.ArrowIn this story:What Is Facial Eczema?Causes of Facial EczemaHow to Prevent Facial EczemaHow to Treat Facial EczemaShould I Treat Facial Eczema Differently Than I Would Eczema on My Body?What Should I Do if Over-The-Counter Products Aren\\'t Cutting It?What Is Facial Eczema?\"Eczema is an inflammation of the skin caused by either an allergen or irritant,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Anthony Rossi, MD. It can also be genetic, and triggered by irritants.Facial eczema has many different symptoms that can manifest themselves differently from person to person, but some common things to look for are red patches, itchy skin, stinging, and dryness. With darker skin tones, it also tends to be scaly, says Dr. Rossi.Eczema is a common condition that can appear anywhere on the body, but if you\\'re grappling with facial eczema, it\\'s likely on the eyelids, eyebrows, cheeks, or chin. And while it is common, you definitely should bring it to your dermatologist. \"Eczema that develops near the eyes needs special attention because the eyes themselves can be affected,\" adds Dr. Alexiades. \"Those with eczema around the eyes are more susceptible to certain eye problems such as conjunctivitis, inflamed cornea, and changes in the shape of the cornea, a condition called keratoconus.\"Causes of Facial EczemaThere are a few different types of facial eczema — which will be key in not just identifying what you\\'re dealing with, but how you treat it. The most common type of facial eczema is atopic dermatitis. \"Atopic dermatitis is genetic and flares can be triggered by dry environmental conditions, not moisturizing, stress, and allergies,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Hadley King, MD.The second type is contact dermatitis, which comes from exposure to an irritating substance or something you may be allergic to (common perpetrators are cosmetics, dyes, soaps, detergents, fragrance, or smoke — in addition to environmental allergens like pet dander or pollen). \"Some people break out in an eczema rash after eating certain foods, such as nuts, shellfish, milk, and eggs,\" says Dr. Alexiades.Try to note when you see an eczema flare and note any common denominators to your dermatologist. This should help both you and your dermatologist narrow it down and get to the root cause.How to Prevent Facial EczemaThe best way to prevent eczema on the face is the most obvious but perhaps the most important method: identify the trigger and remove it. \"For example, if you notice red patches when you wear jewelry, you may be allergic to nickel. Stop wearing jewelry and your eczema may go away,\" says Dr. Alexiades. \"If you notice red itchy patches after a night out, it may be perfume that is your trigger, in which case stop wearing fragrances and look for fragrance-free cosmetics.\"The same goes for cosmetics and skincare. \"Know what’s in your skincare and if you’re prone to allergies,\" says Dr. Rossi. It may be beneficial to go on a \"product diet.\" Pare down your routine to one gentle product (a cleanser is a good place to start) and add them back in slowly, one by one, to see if you can identify which product is causing your facial eczema. Patch testing—applying a small amount of a product to the sensitive skin on the inside of the arm to see if there is a reaction within 24 hours—can also help to narrow things down.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf you find that your flare-ups happen when you\\'re stressed, you may need to identify some lifestyle changes like taking on fewer projects, getting more rest, or finding more time for mindfulness. Likewise, if you notice that your facial eczema gets worse in dry or hot weather, try to plan ahead for AC breaks, come prepared with sunscreen, and find a thicker and more reliable moisturizer that can hang on all day.How to Treat Facial EczemaSometimes, simply removing your facial eczema triggers will totally cure your skin within weeks. But if your facial eczema is very severe and you can\\'t identify any bad actors, you may want to try over-the-counter hydrocortisone or get a topical steroid prescription from your dermatologist. \"A topical corticosteroid cream will help treat any of the causes of facial eczema,\" says Dr. King. “Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects.” They can be used as needed to treat flares but not for ongoing maintenance, according to the National Eczema Association, since prolonged use can cause withdrawal side effects like red, irritated skin and pimple-like papules.Dr. Rossi adds that antihistamines can be an effective short-term solution if the eczema is caused by an allergen. Otherwise, \"there are more systemic medications for severe or widespread cases,\" he says.How to Curb Flare-upsNot all types of eczema have a surefire \"cure,\" but you can definitely make it more manageable and lessen your flare-ups. You may be able to curb irritation with good lifestyle habits, over-the-counter products, and consistent skincare with gentle but moisturizing products.\"Good, gentle care of your skin is the most important aspect of treating facial eczema,\" says Dr. Alexiades, who recommends fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products if you find that you’re prone to flare-ups. \"Consider a mild cleanser and wash your face with lukewarm water, since heat can cause a flare-up.\"Dr. Alexiades also touts the benefits of keeping your skin hydrated. She recommends moisturizers with emollient ingredients like ceramides and cosmetics that also have moisturizing ingredients. \"Having facial eczema doesn’t mean you can never wear makeup, but not all products are the same,\" she says. \"Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and shea butter.\" Moisturizers and cosmetics with moisturizing ingredients (like hyaluronic acid and shea butter) can help to protect the outer skin barrier—which can be damaged or compromised by eczema, according to the National Eczema Association.Should I treat facial eczema differently than I would eczema on my body?Yes. Both Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, and Dr. Sadick recommend using milder products on your face because the skin is thinner and more sensitive than the skin on your body. \"I would use eczema skin-care products designed for face and body respectively as they contain different concentrations of active ingredients,\" says Dr. Sadick.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesAdam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., recommends using weaker topical steroids, as he says, \"facial skin is more sensitive to the skin thinning and lightening effect of topical steroids.\" According to a study by the National Eczema Association, prolonged use of strong topical steroids can cause a host of withdrawal symptoms once you stop using the cream—like burning, stinging, papules, or pimple-like bumps. However, short-term use is safe and effective with the guidance of a dermatologist.What should I do if over-the-counter products aren\\'t cutting it?Sadly, sometimes eczema on the face can prove extremely stubborn to the point where treatment may need to be prescribed by a doctor. \"If home treatments are not helping, you may need prescription medications,\" says Dr. Shah. \"I usually prescribe either a topical steroid or a topical calcineurin inhibitor, a non-steroidal medication that can reduce inflammation and treat eczema.\"Dr. Shah says she sometimes prescribes special moisturizers called barrier repair creams for patients. And if the eczema is severe and not responding to topical treatments, other options include phototherapy, aka light therapy. There\\'s a wide range of treatment options for facial eczema, so it often comes down to trial and error in order to figure out what works for you. We\\'d recommend always consulting your dermatologist before trying anything new.Read more about caring for skin conditions:6 Skin-Care Ingredients to Add to Your Routine If You Have EczemaHow to Treat Scalp Eczema, According to DermatologistsWhy Colloidal Oatmeal Should Be Part of Your Skin-Care RegimenYou can follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on all things beauty.', 'The 2022 Met Gala is here and back on the first Monday of May. This year, celebrities were challenged with the theme, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion,\" with an emphasis on gilded glamour. Tonight, stars are showing how they\\'re channeling the essence of the Gilded Age with black gowns, lengthy nails, and extravagant headpieces.The vintage waves and slicked-back chignons may be nice, but headpieces are the star of the show at this year\\'s version of the fashion event — and rightfully so. Simple headwear like bedazzled tiaras and golden headbands made their appearance alongside elaborate fascinators and massive hats. It\\'s clear that head coverings are key to the gilded glamour theme, and here are some of our favorite ones.Flaming DiscsGetty ImagesLa La Anthony arrived earlier in the night in a burgundy two-piece with a swirly manicure and a large red headpiece that captured our attention. On one side, there\\'s a large circular piece with red ovular pieces woven together. But, on the other side, the headpiece looks completely different — large and small candy apple-red roses shine, bringing this all-over red ensemble together.Hint of PinkGetty ImagesSarah Jessica Parker took our breaths away and clearly understood the gilded glamour assignment with her black-and-white Christopher John Roberts gown and detailed fascinator. This black netted piece covers part of her face, but it gets even better as your eyes travel up. Rolled pieces of black mesh pop out at the top alongside numerous strings with tiny diamond pieces in black and white. The fuchsia flower and leaves add a touch of color to this look that just makes sense.Abstract HaloGetty ImagesWinnie Harlow stepped on the carpet in a short abstract white dress topped with an intricate white-and-golden headpiece that we can\\'t quite describe. There\\'s thin golden rods that flow from the back of her head connecting to the clear-and-white, sharp abstract pieces that curl out from the sides of her head. This piece almost reminds us of the legs of an insect.Covered in SilverGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThis is far from the first headpiece Janelle Monáe has worn on the red carpet, and it won\\'t be the last one we ooooh and ahhhh over. The black-and-silver, striped hood connects to her bedazzled gown, which is the same color, and covers her entire head. It\\'s the epitome of glamour and excellence.Tiny TiarasGetty ImagesEmma Chamberlain was in the salon for hours the day before the Met Gala to achieve this light platinum blonde hair. Her blunt bob was parted down the middle and tucked behind her ears with a silver bedazzled tiara. This tiara isn\\'t in-your-face, but the delicate piece matches her studded accessories well.Pieces of GoldGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesTommy Dorfman made a statement with her hunter green, latex dress with black leather gloves. The small golden headband on her head complements the gold pieces on her cut-out dress. Tiny squarish shapes are all over the top of the headband.Birds of a Feather Getty ImagesQuannah Chasinghorse always brings her culture wherever she goes. For the Met Gala, she paired a large feather headpiece with a voluminous, baby blue tulle dress. The feathers were attached to intricate braids on one side of her head and look stunning with her jewelry.Bathed in WhiteGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesCynthia Erivo\\'s towering white headwrap references the Tignon Laws, which was a law in the late 1800s that forced Black women to cover their hair. The white wrap is also an ode to the many types of headwraps Black women wear around the globe. We\\'re loving the height and volume of this chalk-white headpiece.Wide BrimsGetty ImagesSZA was clearly embracing the saying \"go big or go home,\" with her hot pink gown, a massive black hat, and latex gloves and thigh-high boots. The sheer size of this hat was impressive, and we would love to know if it stayed put the whole night or if she had to take it off to avoid accidentally hitting someone. At the back of the hat is a fuzzy boa that reached below the singer\\'s waist.Sequins GaloreGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSequins and gems had a huge moment at the 2022 Met Gala. Jessica Chastain decided to shine in a long-sleeve, garnet gown with a silver snake that wrapped around the dress. She paired the look with a turban headband in the same red sequins as the dress for a matchy-matchy moment. The hair accessory also has a silver element with a jeweled brooch at the very center of her head — it\\'s lavish, glitzy, and flashy, which is apt for the glamourous theme.Netted VisionGetty ImagesClaire Danes\\'s slicked-back bob was accessorized with a black fascinator that covered most of her face and ears. This netted design was on the simpler side and almost looked like a bunch of small soda plastic rings woven together.One KnotGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesLily Aldridge is another celebrity who matched her entire outfit from head to toe. Her gown, gloves, and headscarf all had the same silver-studded black design. The bejeweled scarf was tied simply right below her neck for a chic but simple look.Golden GloryGetty ImagesNatasha Poonawalla did not skimp out on any gold on the red carpet. Her brown gown was covered in sequins and accessorized with several large gold pieces of jewelry. She even added a golden headband full of multicolored jewels in different sizes. But the main attraction was the golden corset-like piece that extends into a large headpiece. Three thin metal pieces formed a trio of circles around her head and neck, covering a portion of her face. Shorter pieces of gold curl outward on the rings matched the swirly metal on her chest area.With a TiltGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNormani arrived in a velvet black two-piece set with a brand new hair color.

On June 15, the icon announced that her seventh album, titled Renaissance, is dropping on July 29. Even though she alerted her fans of the upcoming music a month in advance — a striking difference from when she released her self-titled album in 2013 without any promotion — she still made sure to keep us on our toes by sharing the exciting news in the middle of the night and appearing on the July cover of British Vogue just a few hours later.This cover is nothing short of magnificent — and the Beyhive agrees. The \"Spirit\" singer looks like royalty sitting on top of a horse in an all-black Maison Alaia gown with a massive feather headpiece. The rest of the photo shoot is just as breathtaking and extravagant. In one image, she appears in another black outfit but with a leather jacket, black box braids that hairstylist Jawara twisted into what looks like Bantu knots, and a glossy black lip, painted by her longtime makeup artist, Sir John. She looks like the baddest person to ever live sitting on top of a motorcycle instead of a horse.The hair and headpieces were clearly a focal priority in this shoot. They are striking, futuristic, and risky. In a few photos, she has dark hair instead of her usual blonde-highlighted strands, which is making some fans wonder if Queen Bey will be returning to her brunette era for this new album.Getty ImagesBut there is one other hairstyle that is sparking some strong reactions from the Beyhive. The hairstyle in question is the choppy baby fringe she wears with a gilded Schiaparelli Haute Couture outfit and jewelry. These short bangs are far from Beyonce\\'s norm and took several Twitter fans back to 2014, one of the few other times we have seen her with baby bangs.If you don\\'t remember that fringe, let me jog your memory for a second — they were thick, very blunt, and super short, stopping several inches about her forehead. She wore similar bangs in her \\'60s-inspired music video for \"Why Don\\'t You Love Me,\" which was released four years prior. She also had a pair of those stubby bangs in a brunette shade in her \"Telephone\" music video with pop star Lady Gaga.screenshot of Beyoncé from “Telephone” video\\nCourtesy of UMG/InterscopeA few fans noted how the resurgence of these bangs indicated that the Houston singer\\'s upcoming music is about to be epic.One user tweeted side-by-side photos of the spiky bangs and her baby fringe from 2014 and, \"Beyoncé is NOT playing she brought the choppy bangs out.\" Another fan compared the two photos and commented, \"Beyoncé even resurrected the chopped and screwed bangs.

Another jokingly noted that the fringe was probably styled by one of her five-year-old twins. \"I love that Beyoncé always includes her kids in her work, the fact that she got rumi and sir to cut her bangs/style her hair,\" the tweet reads.Regardless of your feelings about the baby fringe, we\\'re sure you\\'re more than excited for the upcoming album — we definitely are. Some fans are thinking it\\'s going to include disco and house influences due to rumors about artists she is collaborating with and the overall vibe of the shoot; it blends retro elements, such as a giant disco ball and platform boots, and futuristic designs. We won\\'t fully know until July 29, but we\\'re sure that Beyoncé will deliver hits as she always has.Read more stories about bangs:21 Types of Bangs to Consider If You\\'re Ready to Take the PlungeBottleneck Bangs Are the New, Daintier Take on Curtain BangsYour Guide to Styling, Maintaining, and Growing Out Curtain BangsNow enjoy this pro-dancers entire daily routine:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'In our humble opinion, nothing beats the rush of getting a needle poked through your skin for a piercing. Among the various ways to express yourself through body modification, they\\'re relatively low risk and just plain ol\\' fun.Piercing trends tend to ebb and flow. Some locations, like the ear lobe, seemingly never go out of style while other placements, like the belly button, resurge in popularity every few years or so. The COVID-19 pandemic affected many folks\\' ability to get piercings as mask-covered areas became off-limits. But, as tattoo and piercing shops open back up, more people have been willing to experiment, whether it\\'s by adding new jewelry to old holes or getting something entirely new.We chatted with a few piercers to learn about all the ear and body piercing trends you should expect in the new year. Here are the piercing trends you\\'ll be seeing everywhere in 2022.Ear CurationsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyThe ear is a popular site for piercings, but recently more folks are seeking out ear curations, according to piercer Amber Maysonet who works at Live by the Sword Tattoo. \"It\\'s basically a mapping and planning for either now or future piercings for your ears,\" she explains. Ear curations involve giving the piercer the creative freedom to choose multiple piercings for you while taking into account your aesthetic and your ear\\'s anatomy to figure out the best placements and jewelry. Sometimes these curations also involve adding new jewelry to already existing piercings to ensure everything works together.Maysonet cites social media, especially TikTok, as the reason why she thinks more people are choosing these curations. \"When you look at [these piercings], especially on social media, you see how good everything goes together and how nice [they] look on somebody else, obviously you\\'re like, \\'OMG, I can do that,\\'\" she shares.At Brooklyn\\'s So Gold Studies, piercer and founder Cassi Lopez-March requires that clients have at least three existing piercings and be willing to get one to three additional piercings during an ear curation session. She finds that more of her clients are seeking out \"full-blown ear styling\" rather than coming in with pre-determined placements because the average person does not always know what they want. \"When someone gives us free reign to kind of have fun with it, that\\'s when the magic happens,\" she shares.OrbitalsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyIf you google \"orbital piercing,\" you\\'ll see a couple of different piercing locations, but don\\'t let the internet confuse you, Cassi Lopez-March says. \"An actual orbital is just one ring that connects two holes,\" she explains. You can get two new piercings or use new jewelry to connect older ones. She has noticed this placement becoming extremely popular with clients who want to refresh their old holes and give them a new life. At her shop, they tend to add orbitals to the lobe area to connect second or even third piercings.NavalCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2017, I fulfilled one of my childhood dreams of getting a belly button piercing. I remember a friend of mine was a bit shocked that I chose the location given that it was no longer \"popular.\" But it looks like I may have been ahead of the curve (and honestly, I don\\'t make my decisions on trends alone) because both Maysonet and Lopez-March see a resurgence in belly rings coming soon.Just like fashion and beauty trends, nostalgia is winning once again with piercings, seeing as belly rings had their last heyday in the 2000s. But Maysonet has seen folks adding a bit of a twist to the placement by getting both the top and bottom of their bellies pierced rather than choosing just one or the other.Flat HelixCourtesy of Instagram/@studsFolks are becoming more interested in receiving multiple piercings at once rather than just one. \"Right now, I think the piercing trends of 2022 are being influenced by the excitement and relief of returning to travel, celebrations, and concerts with new trends of bold self-expression,\" Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of piercing studio Studs where they focus exclusively on ear piercings, shares. That\\'s why she predicts that a trio of piercings on the flat helix will be big in the new year.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe flat helix is specifically the flat area of cartilage located in the upper ear. Bubbers says it\\'s a great spot because you can try out a few different types of jewelry options and have fun with customization. She\\'s also noticed an increase in asymmetrical placements, which can be done in this area.EyebrowGetty ImagesRecently, we\\'ve noticed certain celebrities with new eyebrow piercings — some fake, some real. On September 27, Lil Nas X showed off his new eyebrow piercing on TikTok to fans\\' praise. (Since then we haven\\'t really seen it make another appearance, so who knows if the jewelry was just a fake-out.)Cardi B debuted her own eyebrow piercing during Paris Fashion Week in one of the best ways possible. She showed out in an extravagant red Mugler dress and cape with bedazzled red brows and a silver ring through her left eyebrow. The eyebrow was a popular piercing location in the \\'90s and 2000s, and it seems like it will be reentering the mainstream in 2022.Snakebites/StacksCourtesy of Instagram/@ileanastabbedmeMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2019, Studs created their signature \"Snakebite\" piercing, which model Kaia Gerber helped make popular. The name may be a bit confusing if you\\'re used to the Snakebite lip piercing — which typically means two piercings spaced out at each outer corner of the lower lip — but this is an ear piercing that involves stacking two holes close together on the outer cartilage of the mid-ear area. Bubbers says they expect to see folks trying the piercing in new places like the Forward Helix and Conch in 2022.The jewelry in these holes is just as important as the piercings themselves. Scrolling through Studs\\'s Instagram, you\\'ll see ears full of these Snakebite piercings with gold and silver jewelry in all shapes and sizes.NosesCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMaysonet has also seen an increase in nose piercings, both on the nostril and the septum. She cites the resurgence of punk, alternative, and even scene aesthetics as the impetus for this rise. We\\'re also willing to bet that once mask mandates are lifted in certain areas that it will allow more people to finally try the piercing placement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesYou can get a simple septum or nostril piercing or go all out and try two piercings, whether that be with one hole in each nostril, two holes in one nostril, or a septum and nostril piercing. It\\'s up to you to decide what kind of fun you\\'re into.With the unpredictability of the past two years, there\\'s truly no knowing what will happen in the piercing world. But we are sure that more and more folks will continue to dip into creativity and give their piercer freedom to guide them along their piercing journey.Read more stories about body modification:Contraconch Piercings Are Gaining Popularity For Their Unexpected PlacementYour Complete Guide to Vulva PiercingsHow Your Belly Button Piercing Changes When You Get PregnantNow watch 100 years of piercings:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'It almost felt like the MTV VMAs were back to their pre-pandemic form tonight at the 2022 show. Nicki Minaj, LL Cool J, and Jack Harlow hosted and kept us entertained throughout the music-filled night. Minaj was even awarded the 2022 VMA Video Vanguard award, both exciting and well deserved. In addition to these three celebs, Lizzo, Bad Bunny, and Anitta all blessed the stage with their voices.The performances were amazing, and our eyes were zoned in on what these stars were wearing from head to toe, both on and off the stage. They were already wowing us with their massive feather headpieces, face jewelry, and slicked-back hair, but we were also obsessing over all the manicures. Here are just a few that we are loving.Dove CameronGetty ImagesDove Cameron went for dark grunge vibes at the awards show. She paired her strapless leather and floral gown with smoked-out burgundy eye makeup, plum glossy lips, and stiletto-shaped nails.

For example, there were deep red rose charms and silver gems on each middle finger. If you look closely, you might have noticed the black scissor decals on each ring fingernail.Betty WhoGetty ImagesThe Australian-born singer-songwriter showed up with black-and-white graphic nails. Each hand had different nail designs. On one hand, there were various sizes of white and black stars on each nail. The other hand had white hearts on the index and ring fingers. The white design on the middle finger was actually an ode to the awards show; it\\'s the iconic MTV logo.Monét X ChangeGetty ImagesMonét X Change had already caught over eyes with her large afro puffs and bright tropical-inspired makeup, but we made sure not to forget her white swirly tips.

Her bedazzled metallic nails practically blend into her dress in the above photo. The medium-length, almond-shaped nails were full of sparkly gems and jewels.Lil Nas XGetty ImagesNow, hearing the words \"goth Big Bird\" probably sounds like the strangest and worst thing in the world, but we swear Lil Nas X\\'s VMAs outfit will make you rethink that. The rapper showed out with a massive black feather headpiece with matching pants. It\\'s hard to take your eyes off this elaborate feather piece, but the mismatched manicure he wore that night also deserves some fanfare.OPI Nail Lacquer in Bubble Bath$11OPI Nail Lacquer in Black Onyx$11Two nails on each hand were painted completely black by nail artist Temeka Jackson who used OPI GelColor polishes, which are exclusively available to nail artists, to complete this look. Thankfully, the two shades she used, Bubble Bath (pale pink) and Black Onyx (pitch black), are available in nail lacquer form, so this look can be recreated at home. With the Black Onyx polish and a thin brush, she drew French tips, geometric shapes, and lines to create the nail art.Becky GGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesBecky G looked gorgeous in a sequined gown that looked just like a stained glass window.

The different clips stitched together show the model in a pink velvet bathing suit (ah, a true sign of an L.A. winter) with frosty pink eye makeup and matching pink butterfly clips pulling her hair back from her face.\"Todays vibe,\" the nonchalant caption reads, along with a couple of emojis. Throughout the video, Bieber smiles and makes duck faces while she shows off her look. Her hair is middle-parted and styled with natural beach waves and baby braids. As for makeup, she\\'s opted for layered pink eye shadow: a lighter shade on her inner lids, and a darker hue on her outer lids. Pink glitter serves as her eyeliner, which rims both lash lines and extends outward into a baby wing. The monochromatic look also features a rosy blush, a pink lip color, and soft highlighter on her cheek bones. We\\'re taking notes, and plan on channeling this look all spring long.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.For her nails, she\\'s staying on-trend with a classic French oval manicure so simple that it doesn\\'t take away from her finger tattoos.

She\\'s wearing a few necklaces, including mixed and matched pearls with a custom letter bead necklace (although we can\\'t read what it spells out), two belly chains, and gold hoop earrings.We love all of Hailey\\'s content (shout-out to her skin-care tips, pictures with Justin, and TikTok dances), but we can\\'t get enough of her glowing beauty looks, either.

And while it's all too common for some to slouch when it comes to following the theme of the night, one guest nailed it in the gilded glamor department at the 2022 Met Gala. Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers. It was shiny gold and covered in ruby and pearl-looking appliqués. She also sported a gold, armor-esque covering on her other pointer finger. The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore. Somehow, it was both a retro and futuristic look all at once. And one that set the hearts of internet critics aflame.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.King kept the rest of her beauty look simple, with cropped hair and minimal-looking makeup. Because why take attention away from the nail situation?

If that wasn\\'t enough, the \"Kiss Me More\" singer made our jaws drop with the stunning Schiaparelli black gown and gold accessories she wore for the awards show. By now we expect the pop star to capture our attention with every new look, but we didn\\'t expect her to show up to the event with short nails or intricate gold rings that look like they\\'re worth more than my student loans.The \"Say So\" singer didn\\'t hesitate to take risks for this look, something we love from her. Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas gave her a neutral smokey eye with a hint of bright yellow on the inner crease and waterline that complemented the daring gown very well. As for her hair, hairstylist Jared Henderson (known as JStay Ready to many) slicked her dark hair into a high ponytail with a flipped end that we have a good feeling was fun to whip around.Getty ImagesTypically Doja Cat wears lengthy nails, but for this look, she kept them short. Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe. But this manicure is anything but simple, because this opulent jewelry is basically nail art.Her middle finger had the largest ring, which covered her entire finger and nail. The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own. The other two rings were simpler, which is saying something.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one!

The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me.

One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade. As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says.

As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says.

Yep, it\\'s equally as disappointing when you find an eye-catching set of earrings only to find it\\'s made of materials that could irritate your skin. Sure, they say pain is beauty, but when that pain involves itchiness, redness, and uncomfortable rashes (on an already-thin and sensitive part of your skin, no less), it begs the question: \"were these hoops really worth it?\" The short answer is, well, no.And remember: you\\'ll know if your piercing is infected if it\\'s red, inflamed, sore, hot to touch, or if it\\'s releasing puss. You should consult with your physician if you suspect you have an infection.The truth is, if you\\'re someone who struggles with finding earrings that won\\'t cause discomfort, you may have to work a little harder to find your match. \"Unfortunately, sterling silver jewelry is made with a mix of metals, often nickel, which is the most significant irritant to sensitive ears,\" explains Ottawa-based medical director of Concept Medical Samuel Hetz, MD. \"Those with sensitive ears want to find hypoallergenic rhodium-plated jewelry with low to no nickel content.\" He recommends looking for the standard benchmarks of 14k gold or above as well as sterling silver 925 grade to reduce the chances of nickel content.Because we don\\'t believe those with sensitive skin should be left out of the party, we rounded up nine of the best earrings for sensitive ears that are always stylish, and never irritating.BaubleBar Sutara 18K Gold Earrings$48 at BaubleBar$42 at NordstromFor sensitive-skinned folks, Baublebar\\'s Sutara Earrings will make you thank your lucky stars they\\'re made out of 18k gold.

All around me were people filling in or touching up their ink, but I continued onward past the buzzing needles — straight to the back, where the piercer works. After a tough year, I was ready for a bit of body modification to memorialize the challenges and symbolize the jump forward into 2022. What I didn\\'t realize, as I asked for a third lobe piercing to continue to build my stack of hoops, is that my bright idea was of a pace with a wide new piercing trend.More and more customers are asking for what Alaina Rothstein, cofounder of Los Angeles ear piercing service Leo West, refers to as a \"milestone piercing.\" Rothstein has seen mothers and daughters come in for birthday piercing; she knows of a woman who miscarried and got a stud to remind her of the loss. \"It\\'s a fun, really beautiful way to carry something special with you in happy times and in sad times,\" she says. \"And I think it\\'s like super cool that it\\'s translated [from the tattoo world] into the piercing world.\"Our piercers have seen birthdays, bachelorette parties, and groups of friends come in to celebrate together. But what trends are they trying, specifically? In other words, which parts of the ear are getting the most adoration through adornment right now?Meet the experts:Alaina Rothstein and Jill Katz, RN, cofounders of Los Angeles ear-piercing service Leo WestLisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a piercing studio with locations in New York, Texas, and California (among others)Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer at Live by the Sword Tattoo in Brooklyn, New YorkIn This Story:Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?How to Pick Your PiercerConstellation PiercingsStacked LobesVertical StacksForward HelixSnakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)ConchOuter Conch, a.k.a. SconchJump ahead, or read on for everything you need to know about the freshest ear-piercing trends, as well as the estimated length of time the healing process may take.Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?Milestones are one reason customers are flocking to their local licensed piercer, but another is a generalized sense of freedom and autonomy that\\'s arrived as a result of the pandemic. \"With remote work and workplace norms overall changing, more people are feeling free to experiment with bolder looks and express their personality,\" says Lisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a national piercing studio. That experimentation shows up both in the amount of piercings and in the piercings themselves, which are getting \"more creative,\" Bubbers says. (Plus, as Rothstein points out, \"one fun thing about mask-wearing is that your ears show.\")The last \"really important trend,\" as Leo West cofounder Jill Katz, RN describes it, is \"adorning what you got.\" There\\'s no normal, she says. A gorgeous earscape is all about working with your budget and your anatomy to create an embodiment of your style in tiny, beautiful silver, gold, or gem form.The result: forward helices, vertically stacked lobes, conches, sconches, snake bites, and plenty of other piercing types we never knew existed, spanning from the outer rims of the ear to the inner cartilage and back to the earlobe. Our trend-spotting piercers shared the adornments they\\'ve seen grow more popular over 2022, and what they envision for the years (and ears!) to come.How to Pick Your PiercerJust as with microblading, filler, or any other body modification, it\\'s important to find a professional piercer that you trust, with a style that appeals to you. This is an essential step, whether you’re a longtime body modification fan or it’s your first piercing ever.As Brooks notes, the benefit of following a piercer on social media is that you can seek them out and, as in one service she offers, put your ear(s) in her hands. During a \"curation\" appointment, the expert will look at your ear as a whole and help design multiple piercings to fit your style and your desires.At Leo West, that might look like getting multiple differentiated piercings on each ear. \"Symmetry is out,\" says Rothstein. As she points out, a specialist is extra helpful if you\\'re nervous about curating an asymmetrical look. \"It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t want ears that match, but it has to have a rhyme or reason to it,\" she says. \"I have two ears, and I like to say ‘one’s a little bit classy, one\\'s a little bit sassy.\\'\"Constellation PiercingsInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhile some of this year\\'s trends include holes in unexpected places, more of them involve third, fourth, or fifth additions to an already-pierced ear. At Leo West, the result is what they\\'ve named a \"constellation.\" A constellation consists of \"really small pieces, close together, closer than what your traditional spacing would be,\" explains Rothstein. The result is an \"intentionally random\" grouping of ear piercings that show off studs and gems.Stacked LobesInstagram user @leowestco\"People often come in [to the studio] and say \\'I’m not cool enough,\\'\" for a trendy piercing, recounts Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer in Brooklyn. If you\\'re intimidated by the thought of a conch piercing or even a constellation, Brooks thinks that an ear stack is an easier entry point. These piercings are less painful than their cartilage-filled brethren, and can make their way up the lobe either evenly spaced or placed close together.Vertical StacksInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"If I\\'m being honest, I love to put my hair behind my ear to show the little pops of pieces sitting right above your classic [piercing],\" laughs Rothstein. She\\'s referring to a vertical stack, which entails a piercing centered directly above your traditional first or second hole. It\\'s usually filled with a small stone or a small star, Rothstein\\'s favorite. This piercing does require a certain amount of space on the lobe, but if you have enough canvas to play with, it \"gives the ear a little extra uniqueness.\"Forward Helixcourtesy of StudsThe official name for that bouncy piece of cartilage where your ear meets your skull is the \"forward helix.\" According to Bubbers, customers are coming in requesting one or even multiple piercings on the forward helix. \"We do see new and different piercing trends emerge each year based on what’s trending in fashion, culture, and celebrity,\" she says. Celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Chantal Jeffries have helped popularize the new (and finicky — helix piercings can take up to nine months to heal) style.Snakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)In the realm of body piercing, the term \"snakebite\" typically refers to two piercings on either side of your lower lip, oftentimes barbells or studs.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen it comes to ears, however, it entails two holes placed close together, slightly separated from the rest of your ear piercings, giving the impression of that your piercer just might have used two fangs to get the job done. According to Bubbers, most customers opt for a snakebite in their “midi,\" the center point of the outer ear.ConchInstagram user @leowestcoWe\\'ve named conch piercings as of-trend for the past few years, but the cartilage piercing is still popular enough to remain on the list. It pierces through the inner-ear cartilage that makes up the back of the year. At Studs, Bubbers says customers are opting more and more for a snakebite on the conch for a doubly trendy effect.Outer Conch (Sometimes Known as a \"Sconch\")courtesy of Studs\"I hope you don\\'t use this name,\" laughs Brooks. She prefers the more medical-sounding \"outer conch,\" but the phrase \"sconch\" is catching on to describe a piercing placed at the lining ridge in the cavern space close to the center of the ear.\"It\\'s right in your eye-line when people look at you,\" she says, so it provides a way to show a bit of personality even when you\\'re on Zoom or wearing a mask. Because it\\'ll be eye-catching no matter what kind of earring(s) you have in, Brooks likes adorning an outer conch piercing with a piece of jewelry that makes a big statement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesMore on the world of piercings:How Tongue Piercings Work, From Pain Level and Placement to Aftercare and Healing TimeHow to Remove Every Type of Piercing at Home8 Types of Ear Piercings, ExplainedContraconch Ear Piercings Are Gaining Popularity for Its Unexpected PlacementIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?

That way, I have a scent memory anchored to that destination or time period for whenever I choose to relive it. My last international trip, to a prestigious wellness resort in Austria for some on-the-ground reporting, demanded a very specific choice: something compact enough to fit in my carry-on without getting tossed by TSA, calming enough to match the vibe of the Alpine oasis, and extra long-lasting so it would last through hikes, meals, and medical treatments without reapplication. Lastly, it would need to smell expensive, because my fellow wellness-seekers would expect as much — but we\\'ll get to that later.After much deliberation, I landed on a luxe new formula that had just hit my desk before my flight: the Jennifer Fisher My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil.My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil$65I was initially surprised that Jennifer Fisher, a jewelry designer beloved by her red carpet clientele and the master behind some of Jennifer Lopez\\'s favorite hoop earrings, had ventured into perfumery. That said, fragrance does feel like a sparkling accessory that amps up any outfit or beauty look, and Fisher wanted her new perfume oil to make a statement for the wearer. \"I want anyone wearing My Scent to feel confident and sexy,\" she tells Allure. “And to smell like a fresh baked cookie.\" Upon first wear, I didn\\'t flag baked goods as a top note, but I did instantly fall for the vanilla and coconut Fisher knew she wanted to include in the formula.\"The blend of vanilla and coconut brings back memories from my childhood growing up in Santa Barbara, California,\" she says. \"For years, I was combining different vanilla and coconut fragrances to try and create my own personal scent. Finding a scent that was a combination of surf wax from the beaches in my hometown, Montecito, and a fresh baked cookie is what I\\'ve always wanted.\"Australian sandalwood, pear, and Tonka bean flank the creamy hero notes, and it all comes together to smell equal parts sunny and cozy, like throwing on a cashmere sweater on a breezy summer night. Toting it around is just as effortless too: I carried the teeny-tiny rollerball in my airplane carry-on, my spa robe to and from massages and lunch, and even in my fanny pack while Nordic walking in the mountains.No, really, I took this tube everywhere with me.\\nTaylore Glynn\"I wanted to come out with something small, compact, and portable you could throw in your bag and take everywhere with you,\" says Fisher. \"A spray to me didn\\'t feel as transportable, but that doesn\\'t mean I am ruling it out for the next product. This oil was designed intentionally to be worn and carried on-the-go.\" In addition to being totable, the formula also fulfilled my need for something that would last through spa treatments and saunas.\"Coconut is a good oil carrier to round out scents,\" says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, noting that scent can last longer in oil form because it\\'s not watered down. \"Atomized scents usually contain alcohol to help spraying. Fragrance oil is the most concentrated form [you can find].\"The scent was so powerful that even my fellow resort guests noticed. In fact, I was flagged down multiple times in the dining room and in the halls to reveal what I was wearing because it smelled \"beautiful\" and \"divine.\" For important context, some of the resort guests on the premises at the time — who I can\\'t explicitly identify — included one of the most famous supermodels of our generation, an Oscar-winning actress, and an entirely different famous jewelry designer with whom I chatted about ketamine therapy. I realized that My Scent smelled flat-out expensive, which seems to be a selling point amongst perfume enthusiasts on social media. In fact, there\\'s a whole genre of #FragranceTok posts dedicated to perfumes that make you smell, well, rich. After studying these videos, there\\'s a handful of perfumes that seem to universally smell like wealth: Parfums de Marly Delina, Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Montale Paris Intense Cafe, and three different Maison Francis Kurkdjian perfumes.Courtesy of brandParfums de Marly Delina$335Courtesy of brandYves Saint Laurent Libre Eau de Parfum Spray$140 $112 at NordstromIntense Cafe Eau de Parfum$170Courtesy of brandMaison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540$325They all also happen to share one intoxicating note: vanilla, which lies at the heart of My Scent.

Well, we say it's time to take a moment to appreciate such bold choices, such as Doja Cat's quirky makeup looks from Paris Fashion week — she still has us wondering how her shirt remained white with all that gold. And we certainly can't leave out the Hadid sisters' bleached brows for their own prance down the very same runways. It's not much of a shocker, then, that Gigi Hadid went for something a bit odd and definitely bold for a recent red-carpet beauty moment. For the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards on November 7, Hadid graced the carpet with an unconventional cool gray lipstick.I'll be the first to admit that I did a double-take at first glimpse. No, it's not your typical choice where a lipstick shade is concerned, but makeup artists Patrick Ta and Akina Shimizu were able to pull off this muted-yet-fresh-faced makeup look on Hadid. Catch me zooming in on those lips that are seemingly matte and glossy at the same time. We're definitely not the only ones hoping the details will soon be dropped on what particular beauty brand this lipstick is made by. Nonetheless, this all-American color pallet is insanely cohesive.Let's also not forget the striking blonde hair color and the sleek, slicked-back bun hair stylist Laura Polko put together to bring out the jewelry on Hadid's ears and nose. My favorite part is the septum ring paired with the tartan-patterned Thom Browne attire styled by Mimi Cuttrell — it's full-on grunge. I'm honestly tempted to break out my alternative pop-rock playlist, like, now.

The supermodel went for a runway-ready vibe for both of her costumes this year, though they were extremely different in tone.For her first look, Bieber covered herself in roses to pay homage to an Yves Saint Laurent haute couture runway look from 1999, originally worn by model Laetitia Casta. In her carousel of pics, Bieber wears a top and miniskirt made of huge pink roses, enhanced by a matching pink organza ruffled train at her hips. Roses also pop up on one ankle and serve as a flower crown atop her head. The look is very The Birth of Venus but make it fashion —and floral.Bieber let the roses be the centerpiece of her costume and kept her hair and makeup subtle and natural with radiant \"glazed\" skin, deep rose lips, and a hint of shimmery pink eye shadow, then finished off the costume with a pale pink and white manicure. She wore no jewelry or accessories other than her engagement diamond and a pair of pale pink ankle-strap sandals. While Casta wore the rose look with Raphaelite ringlet curls, Bieber decided on loose brunette waves for a more modern approach. I just have one question, Hailey: Are those real roses? Hopefully, you de-thorned them if so!Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Later on during Halloweekend, Bieber ditched the angelic florals of her first costume in favor of something darker: a \"Versace Vampire.\" The model donned a strappy black bustier top and high-waisted black skirt with a black and gold Versace logo belt, opera-length shiny black latex gloves, and a pair of vampire fangs for the Goth-inspired vampire moment. A black wig, bright purple eyeshadow, flushed cheeks, and blood-red lips (obviously), plus chunky gold necklaces and huge gold and pearl earrings added to the glamourous \\'90s Versace vibe; she could have walked right off a Gianni Versace runway, minus the fangs.Instagram/Hailey BieberThe two looks may have been complete opposites, but they paid homage to Bieber\\'s fashion roots in the most gorgeously spooky and stunning way.More celeb Halloween looks you may have missed:The Kardashian\\'s Halloween Costumes Included Mystique, Bride of Frankenstein and Jessie from Toy StoryYou Have to See Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly as Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee for HalloweenMegan Thee Stallion Has Outdone Herself in the Halloween Nail Art DepartmentMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNow, learn Hailey\\'s 10 biggest beauty tips:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'TikTok-turned-reality star Dixie D\\'Amelio finally committed to the hairstyle she\\'s been longing for since sixth grade.

You can find plenty of examples across social media. Just look to hashtags #tonguepiercing and #tonguepiercings on TikTok and Instagram, which have over 790 million views and 520,000 posts, respectively.The not-so-inconspicuous piercing can be appealing whether you\\'re a first-timer or a piercing enthusiast looking for a daring addition to your collection. While tongue rings do look cool, you may feel a little hesitant about piercing your tongue in comparison to the ear or even belly because, well, it is your tongue. The stakes seem higher and more dangerous should an infection occur.But despite the location, the aftercare for tongue piercings is actually a lot easier (and a lot less painful) than some would expect. Here\\'s everything you need to know before scheduling your piercing appointment, whether you\\'re undecided about taking the plunge or ready to get your tongue pierced tomorrow.Meet the experts:Jenna Myers, a piercer at Live By the Sword Tattoo in New York CityErich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone HealthLynn Loheide, a body piercer based in Nashville, TennesseeAre tongue piercings dangerous?Before you even think about setting up your appointment, it\\'s important to understand the risks associated with tongue piercings. Like any piercing, there\\'s always a possibility of infection or rejection.Sometimes the signs of infection can be easy to confuse with irritation in piercings, especially if you\\'re extra paranoid. But New York City-based piercer Jenna Myers says that there tends to be a pretty big distinction between the two.\"[With an] infection, your tongue is going to look absolutely wild,\" Myers shares. \"It\\'ll be two to three times the size, turning almost green or white, [with puss].\" When that happens, she always advises going to the ER for professional help. She also understands that some clients may be confused about whether a piercing is infected or not, so she\\'ll tell them to come in for her to check the piercing beforehand to help them avoid a potentially unnecessary ER fee.Erich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone Health, notes that pus, severe tongue swelling, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and difficult breathing indicate that it\\'s time to seek out a medical professional. Typically, infected piercings are usually treated with antibiotics and the removal of jewelry, he explains.But there are some rare cases where surgery might be needed to drain an abscess or deal with any other complications, according to Dr. Voigt. For example, he once had to perform an emergency surgery on a patient because their tongue started to fill with blood and swell, leading them to choke. \"Fortunately, I was able to take the person to the operating room, remove the piercing (which was difficult because half of it became incorporated into the swollen tongue), incise the tongue, tie off a bleeding artery and well as cauterize the muscles, and then suture the tongue back together,\" Dr. Voigt shares.Luckily, not every tongue piercing will become infected. Still, it\\'s important to note that regardless of placement, the piercing can cause damage to the teeth and gums, according to piercer Lynn Loheide and Dr. Voigt. \"You need to understand that going into it, be okay with that risk, and also know what you have to do to minimize that risk,\" Loheide shares.Are horizontal \"snake eyes\" tongue piercings safe?Speaking of placement, there are restrictions as to where the tongue piercing can go. You might have heard of snake eyes before. For those who are unfamiliar, this style typically refers to a horizontal tongue piercing at the tip of the tongue. And if you had hopes of getting that piercing, keep dreaming. Unfortunately, experts say that tongue piercings should only go vertically through the tongue because horizontal placement comes with a big risk of damage to the teeth and gum recession.\"When we\\'re piercing vertically, especially in the center, we\\'re piercing through a connective tissue between those muscles,\" Loheide explains. \"But when you\\'re piercing horizontally, you\\'re actually pinning those muscles together, and that can cause a lot of damage.\" They also note that in the state of Oregon, horizontal tongue piercings are banned for this reason.Can anyone get a tongue piercing?Though everyone\\'s tongue is different, Loheide says if your tongue is too short or you have a tongue-tie — which is basically when the webbing underneath your tongue comes almost or all the way to the tip — a tongue piercing is probably not the best option for you.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen you arrive at your appointment, don\\'t be surprised if the piercer starts analyzing your mouth. In fact, that\\'s a good sign because your unique anatomy will dictate where you can and can\\'t get pierced, and any reputable piercer will ensure to take that into account, Loheide shares.\"We want to see where the blood flow is along the underside of the tongue and make sure that we\\'re not too close to it,\" they explain. \"But we also want to look at the shape of someone\\'s teeth and someone\\'s mouth when we\\'re deciding placement.\" That way, a piercer can ensure that they aren\\'t causing unnecessary damage and that the jewelry won\\'t rub up uncomfortably against your teeth.What can I expect during a tongue piercing appointment?Before your appointment, it\\'s imperative that you brush your teeth and tongue before arriving. Myers shares that typically her clients are given mouthwash right before to help clean their mouths out.As mentioned above, most of your appointment will be spent on prepping and checking your tongue before the needle is inserted. The actual piercing part of the session is short, just like most other piercings — a hollow needle is pushed through the tongue, and then the piercer adds the jewelry, which is a barbell shape.For standard tongue piercings, the ring is usually in the center of the tongue. Though horizontal piercings are a big no-no, you can still get two vertical tongue piercings. Some may call them venom piercings, but Loheide prefers to just refer to them as paired tongue piercings because for some people venom refers to two horizontal piercings, and the slang terms used change over time.\"Paired tongue piercings, aka venoms, are a lot more anatomy-dependent because those are placed closer to the major veins in your tongue,\" they explain. \"So we have to make sure that there\\'s space around that blood flow for them to be placed safely.\"Like any piercing, you should expect pain, and though it\\'s subjective, Loheide and Myers both swear that a tongue piercing is not as bad as you might think. \"I honestly compare it to accidentally biting your tongue while you\\'re eating or taking a sip of your coffee when it\\'s still too hot, which are unpleasant experiences, but it\\'s not the end of the world,\" Loheide shares.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn fact, they say that the most uncomfortable part is having the piercer\\'s hands in your mouth for an extended amount of time. Myers notes that on a scale of one to 10, most of her clients rate standard tongue piercings between a one to three, and paired tongue piercings a three to five.What does aftercare for a tongue piercing look like?There are a few things to expect immediately after your piercing. If you\\'ve been pierced before, some of these won\\'t be too shocking, but there are certain effects that are specific to tongue piercings.Right after your appointment, expect your tongue to be a bit swollen and painful for about one to two weeks, according to Loheide. That\\'s naturally going to happen because the piercing is a fresh wound. In addition to the pain and swelling, you\\'ll also deal with a slight lisp or change in how you speak. \"After about a week, the swelling will go down, and then the rest of the healing process is pretty easy,\" they share.Myers estimates that for a single tongue piercing, it will take about one to three months and three to five for paired piercings. \"Because the tongue is so vascular, it has a lot of blood flow to it, so it heals really quickly,\" she says. On the other hand, Loheide says to expect it to take about three to five months to be fully healed.Thankfully, the aftercare for tongue piercings isn\\'t too complicated. In general, maintaining good oral hygiene — brushing your teeth regularly and flossing — is important. Once you get home, Loheide recommends immediately changing out your toothbrush for a new one and using milder oral hygiene products. They advise avoiding toothpaste with whitening ingredients.Both piercers strongly suggest using an alcohol-free mouthwash that won\\'t burn your mouth. Loheide likes Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse because it doesn\\'t taste as badly as some alcohol-free mouthwashes do, it\\'s affordable, and can be found in most drug stores. Myers also recommends sterile saline solution, which tends to be recommended for most piercings.Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse$10Apart from switching up your oral products, you may have to change what you eat, but only for a short while. Myers suggests avoiding spicy, crunchy, and acidic foods in the first few weeks to avoid irritation. \"Things that you wouldn\\'t [want on] a paper cut, basically, you don\\'t want to eat the first few weeks of a tongue piercing, because it will cause serious discomfort,\" she says.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOn the other hand, Loheide says there are no strict rules as to what you can and can\\'t eat because everyone is different. But you still have to be mindful of how your mouth and tongue feel when you do eat or drink certain things. \"If you go to eat something and you\\'re like, \\'Wow, this feels terrible to eat,\\' don\\'t keep eating it,\" they share.Ultimately, try to not go overboard with your piercing aftercare, because that could potentially case more irritation. \"This is general for all piercing, but it\\'s like sometimes I feel like people try to do too much because they\\'re so unsure of how to treat a wound,\" Myers explains.\" Being as simple as possible with your aftercare is really best. Your body is really good at healing itself.\"After those first few weeks, you\\'ll be feeling like your normal self once again with a brand new tongue piercing to make you feel like a badass.Read more stories about piercings:7 Piercing Trends That Will Be Everywhere in 2022How to Remove Every Kind of Piercing Jewelry at HomeIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?Now enjoy the unboxing of the April 2022 Allure Beauty Box:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'Doja Cat is ready to travel to a galaxy far, far away.

Popularized in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, the timing for this resurgence makes sense: We\\'re already sticking Y2K-inspired rhinestones on our faces, breaking out the frosted eye shadow, and revisiting \"thong jeans\" so low-rise they would make even Paris Hilton blush. It was only a matter of time before bonding Swarovski crystal butterflies to our enamel made a comeback, too.Dental bling may be one of this year\\'s biggest beauty trends, but it\\'s nothing new. Anthropological records show that dentists as far back as the Mayan Empire decorated teeth with jade, gold, and turquoise, according to Anjali Rajpal, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California, nicknamed \"The Diamond Dentist\" on account of the bejeweled designs she creates for her celebrity clientele.Tooth jewelry also has significance in Black culture — a well-known example is grills, which were first worn by West Indian immigrants in the \\'70s and \\'90s hip-hop artists. Grills are decorative covers made of gold, silver, or encrusted with jewels that snap over one or more teeth and are removed at the end of each day. Tooth gems as we know them today differ from grills, but it\\'s important to recognize the cultures they\\'re derived from.Instead of a mouthful of precious metal, tooth gems are usually a single or a few delicate multi-colored gems or diamonds that are bonded individually to the teeth. Pinterest is clearly here for the trend, with the site reporting an 85 percent uptick in searches for \"tooth gems\" last year alone, while TikTok views for the hashtag #toothgems currently stand at 130.4m. \"Tooth gems add a little edge to someone\\'s style and are a less invasive way to make a statement than a tattoo,\" Dr. Rajpal tells Allure.Aesthetics aside, what about the dental health implications of these tiny adornments? We asked experts to share how tooth gems can be applied, and cared for, safely.Meet the Experts:Anjali Rajpal, DMD, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California.Michael Apa, DDS, an aesthetic dentist in New York City.Brian Kantor, DDS, a cosmetic dentist in New York City.How are tooth gems applied?Everyone\\'s bite is different, so there\\'s no avoiding a consultation first – sorry, dentist\\'s orders. \"[A consultation appointment] is also an opportunity to take my client\\'s style and personality into account when collaborating with them for their jewelry design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.If you\\'re choosing a semi-permanent tooth gem, no drilling is required: The technique is similar to the way braces are applied. \"An acidic solution (or etching gel) is placed on the tooth\\'s surface, microscopically roughening the enamel, before the gemstone is bonded to it with an adhesive and curing lamp,\" explains New York City-based aesthetic dentist Michael Apa. The whole process only takes a matter of minutes and is painless, provided the gem is bonded to the surface of a healthy tooth, Dr. Apa says. \"If you\\'ve got worn-away enamel from grinding your teeth or eating too many acidic foods, there will likely be sensitivity,\" he adds.Permanent tooth gems do require drilling a hole in the desired location, so be ready for the commitment if you\\'re planning on getting this adornment because it won\\'t be easy to remove. Also worth noting: While tooth gems can be bonded to veneers, Dr. Apa says they can\\'t be worn with Invisalign.How much do tooth gems cost?There\\'s no one-size-fits-all price tag. The cost will largely depend on your choice of design and materials (a Swarovski crystal, for example, will be cheaper than a diamond). Some dentists charge two separate fees – one for the gemstone and another for the application. \"My in-office fees include both and can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the size, quality, and quantity of the stones and the nature of the design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.How long do tooth gems last?Most tooth gems are semi-permanent and can last anywhere between six months to one year, says Brian Kantor, a cosmetic dentist in New York City. The right aftercare and dental materials used to bond the gemstone to the tooth will help you get the most out of your new dental jewelry.\"For the first 24 hours after getting a tooth gem, you should only eat soft foods and avoid using an electric toothbrush or drinking soda, coffee, or tea to protect the fresh bond,\" says Dr. Kantor, adding that picking or playing with your tooth gem is also off-limits. Sometimes a tooth gem may fall off on its own if you bite down hard on something, but Dr. Kantor says not to worry: \"There\\'s no harm to your tooth if that happens and the gem can simply be re-attached.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSemi-permanent tooth gems can also be safely removed by a dentist if you change your mind or want to switch up the design. “The gem is simply polished off along with any adhesive on the tooth,\" says Dr. Rajpal. As for permanent tooth gems, though, be warned that removing a permanent tooth gem that was inserted into a tooth will leave a hole. \"This hole will then need to be filled in with a white filling material that is color-matched to the existing shade of the tooth,\" adds Dr. Rajpal.Are tooth gems safe?If you ask Dr. Apa, tooth gems are purely an accessory. \"They\\'re a very specific aesthetic choice because they don\\'t offer the restorative benefits that come with veneers or crowns,\" he says. On top of not offering any benefits, there are a few dental risks that come with getting a set of gems.\"Tooth gems can trap plaque and create places for stray food particles and harmful bacteria to hide,\" Dr. Kantor explains. Needless to say, keeping the gem clean and practicing good oral hygiene is essential if you want to avoid gum inflammation, decay, or other dental issues. Alongside regular flossing, Dr. Apa recommends brushing twice a day with a non-abrasive toothpaste and soft bristle sonic toothbrush \"because the vibration offers a deeper clean and dislodges food stuck to the gemstone,\" he says.The bottom line? In general, as long as a dentist applies your chosen gem, and you\\'re taking proper care of your teeth at home, \"the risks are minimal,\" Dr. Apa says. In the wrong hands, he warns you could end up getting a gem with a rough surface that can cause traumatic lesions on the inside of the lip. \"Or if the gem isn\\'t placed properly, you can break an opposing tooth when you bite down,\" he cautions.So, I shouldn\\'t try applying tooth gems at home?Nope! Advice from dentists hasn\\'t stopped folks from taking the DIY route with nail art gems and superglue, but it should. \"It sounds obvious, but nobody should be ingesting toxic glue,\" insists Dr. Rajpal, who prefers to work with biocompatible materials such as gold and precious or semiprecious stones. \"Besides, glue doesn\\'t properly bond the gem to the tooth structure as well as dental materials,\" she explains. \"It\\'s far safer for a tooth gem to be applied by an experienced dentist, using a non-toxic material and polished to avoid any bacterial traps, as it will last longer, be more comfortable and hygienic.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesFor the same reason, Dr. Apa recommends a dentist remove the gem to avoid accidentally stripping away healthy enamel or tooth structure. \"You shouldn\\'t DIY anything in dentistry,\" he says. \"Tooth gem application is a dental procedure, and all procedures should be performed by a professional.\"More stories to take a bite into:I Took on Credit Card Debt to Get Braces as an AdultDentists Reveal the Correct Order to Brush Your Teeth, Floss, and Use MouthwashHow to Deal With Teeth Grinding and Jaw ClenchingNow, see how dental care has evolved over the last 100 years:', 'The 2022 MTV VMAs have barely even begun, and Lizzo is already stealing the show. The \"About Damn Time\" singer arrived at the awards show in an ensemble that was almost as dark as the black carpet she walked on. She looked like she could be princess of the underworld or even a gothic cake topper with her massive navy blue gown, dark lipstick, and golden rings on her ears, fingers, and lips.Where do you even start with a look like this? The singer\\'s navy blue gown was a gorgeous rumpled, off-the-shoulder dress from Jean Paul Gaultier. She paired it with sheer navy blue gloves that covered her forearms.Her golden jewelry was as excessive as her stunning gown in all the best ways possible. On both of her ring fingers, she wore an abstract looped ring. Earrings of various sizes covered her entire cartilage and lobe. The rings along her cartilage were thicker in width but smaller in circumference, so they hugged her ear. The hoops on the lobe were much larger, nearly skimming her shoulders. The last ring lay in the middle of her bottom lip.Getty ImagesThe lip ring combined with the dark blue lipstick and slicked back, wet-looking hair gave this look an edgier vibe that fit right in at the VMAs. Makeup artist Alexx Mayo was responsible for this glam makeup and matte lip. He painted her lips with Charlotte Tilbury\\'s Rock N Kohl liner in Bedroom Black and Eye Colour Magic Liner Duo in Super Blue to create the deep navy blue hue.Hairstylist Shelby Swain, who often works with the pop star, gave Lizzo\\'s wig the wet look using Matrix\\'s Instacure Anti-Breakage Porosity Spray and Vavooom Extra Full Freezing Spray. For the simple baby hairs, Swain used Matrix\\'s Overachiever Paste 3-in-1 Cream to keep the swoops in place.It was hard to see her nails beneath her mesh gloves, but the almond-shaped claws were painted with silver nail polish by nail artist Eri Ishizu. She used OPI\\'s GelColor in Clean State as a base before adding Chrome Effects in Mixed Metals to create an iridescent finish. Those two products are exclusive to nail artist pros, but OPI\\'s Nail Lacquer in Clean Slate and Infinite Shine in Silver on Ice work as replacements.Getty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf this was just her arrival look, we can\\'t wait for what she\\'s going to be wearing on stage when she performs.

The Emily in Paris star may be called \"classic\" or \"glamorous,\" but the actor rarely ventures into the unconventional. And you could argue the same thing about luxury brand Cartier. But apparently, when the two get together, the trendy, off-beat coolness comes out — a Collins\\'s hair is proof.In the new ad campaign for Clash de Cartier, a jewelry collection that strikes a balance between classic and eccentric, Collins does exactly that. We see her in an elegant, asymmetrical black dress and red lipstick, and her brown hair is pulled back into a sleek, low bun, not unlike the style she wore for her wedding — basically exactly how we picture Lily Collins when we picture Lilly Collins.As Billy Idol\\'s \"Dancing With Myself\" plays, she stands in contrast with another version of herself that looks completely out of her beauty comfort zone, yet it somehow works so well.

Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.On Tuesday, Collins teased a preview of the look, giving us a peek at the baby bangs, which appear to have been styled by Gregory Russell. The makeup looks were done by Fiona Stiles, and the manicures by nail artist Thuy Nguyen.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Although Collins recently told us that her curtain bangs are a \"dedicated decision\" that she\\'s wanted to do \"for years but never had the courage to take the plunge,\" it looks like she may be open to trying other, unexpected fringe looks.

Her 29th birthday look has all the elements that define her signature style: inches and inches of hair, super long acrylic nails, and lots of bling.She posted a few photos of the gorgeous birthday look to Instagram on July 4, showing off her mile-long curls nearly as white as snow, pastel purple eye makeup, and baby blue nail design full of iridescent gems. She is seen in a cutout purple dress with her platinum blonde curls cascading over one of her shoulders, the ends almost grazing her knees. Though she tends to switch up her hair color often, she\\'s indulged in her blonde era many times before with this bright hue, just like when she chopped off her hair into a platinum-blonde buzz cut right at the end of 2021.The light hair color pairs beautifully with her lavender cut crease, which also complements her gown perfectly. You\\'d think the light purple shade would also make an appearance on her nails, but not at all. Instead, this stiletto manicure was painted a light blue hue, which feels like an apt choice for the water sign. Each icy blue nail was filled with opalescent jewels of various sizes running straight down the middle.

On the 2022 red carpet, it has come in the form of elaborate headpieces, an overwhelming amount of black attire for a white-tie event, and some very funky hairstyles — especially including that of Alicia Keys.Keys walked the red carpet on May 2 in a black gown, completed by a cape bedazzled with the New York City skyline (how fitting for the singer who wrote the concrete-jungle-wet-dream-tomato song). When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection. When is it not?Getty ImagesThen I caught a look at her long braid from the side and the back and now I'm bewildered by… whatever is in her hair. As you can see below, Keys's braid is — I don't even know what word to use here — woven? Woven with something I'm finding very hard to describe. It's like a black-and-silver ribbon… made out of CDs… bedazzled CDs?Getty ImagesIn short, I have no idea what is going on with this hairstyle or what to call it, but it looks damn good. Then again, Alicia Keys could've rocked up to the Met Gala in a garbage can and she still would've made it look soulfully chic. It's what she does best.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King's Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNeed more?

On the 2022 red carpet, it has come in the form of elaborate headpieces, an overwhelming amount of black attire for a white-tie event, and some very funky hairstyles — especially including that of Alicia Keys.Keys walked the red carpet on May 2 in a black gown, completed by a cape bedazzled with the New York City skyline (how fitting for the singer who wrote the concrete-jungle-wet-dream-tomato song). When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection. When is it not?Getty ImagesThen I caught a look at her long braid from the side and the back and now I'm bewildered by… whatever is in her hair. As you can see below, Keys's braid is — I don't even know what word to use here — woven? Woven with something I'm finding very hard to describe. It's like a black-and-silver ribbon… made out of CDs… bedazzled CDs?Getty ImagesIn short, I have no idea what is going on with this hairstyle or what to call it, but it looks damn good. Then again, Alicia Keys could've rocked up to the Met Gala in a garbage can and she still would've made it look soulfully chic. It's what she does best.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King's Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNeed more?

But, what if I told you there\\'s another radiance-intensifying ingredient that\\'s also a staple in your jewelry box? That\\'s right, I\\'m talking about gold, which is one of the many luminosity-amplifying ingredients in 111Skin\\'s Rose Gold Radiance Booster.111Skin is no stranger to luxury beauty: the brand has started gaining some serious hype from celebs like Kesha and it\\'s become a repeat feature in the Allure Beauty Box for its impressive, skin-nourishing formulations. Even our very own associate features director Dianna Mazzone is a fan of the brand, particularly 111Skin\\'s Vitamin C Brightening Booster. So, I already knew I was in good hands when this fancy-schmancy rose gold bottle first landed on my desk.Courtesy of brandImmediately, I did a quick scan of the label to see if my sensitive, rosacea-stricken skin could handle the formula. The serum contains a few ingredients that are already in my skin-care regimen: hydrating hyaluronic acid, brightening niacinamide, and soothing rosewater. \"The best known effect of rosewater is being anti-inflammatory, which can reduce redness and swelling in the skin,\" Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist James Wang, MD, says of the latter ingredient. \"The hydrating and antibacterial benefits, combined with its ability to calm the skin, can be especially helpful in some patients with inflammatory acne and rosacea.\"But what made me raise my eyebrows in skepticism was the pure gold extract. This may seem like a gimmicky ingredient, but Dr. Wang says that this precious metal can actually have a purpose in your skin-care routine. He notes that gold actually is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and claims of targeting fine lines and wrinkles. \"Although not a fully proven effect, gold is thought to help with wrinkles and signs of sun damage by also boosting collagen production,\" he says. With all of this in mind, Dr. Wang says this ingredient can be irritating to sensitive skin or those allergic to gold, so always patch test this product before applying it to your face.According to the bottle\\'s directions, there are two ways you can use this product: alone after cleansing or mixed into your favorite moisturizer. Whichever path you choose, the brand recommends using one to two drops. I decided to try both avenues of application simply out of curiosity and I\\'ve found that its slippery formula absorbs equally as well, regardless of how you apply it.As for its texture, the Rose Gold Radiance Booster is shimmery and has a slippery feel to it, almost like a champagne-hued version of a snail mucin serum. Once I applied it to my skin, the first thing I noticed was how teensy the gold particles were, which didn\\'t irritate my skin at all. It left a reflective veil of natural-looking shimmer without looking too intense or dramatic, and because of this, I\\'ve been reserving this sparkly serum for my morning skin-care regimen.Jennifer Hussein for AllureSo, is this gold-infused serum really worth the triple-digit price tag? Considering the fact that I\\'ve been using it daily for two months and have seen a major difference in the radiance of my complexion, my answer is a million times over, absolutely. Sure, there are many brightening skin-care products on the market, but as someone who\\'s tested hundreds of these formulations, 111Skin\\'s iridescent serum provided significant results that I haven\\'t achieved with other picks. And, at the very least, it\\'s literally liquid gold for your face, so why not treat yourself to a little luxury?111Skin Rose Gold Radiance Booster$135Want to try it for yourself?

Each design I create is a reflection of who I am.\"Short Nail Art InspirationGrowing up in Texas with family from Mexico City, Goldstein has had a wide variety of influences on her nail designs, the biggest of which was museum art. She developed an appreciation of the techniques of Diego Rivera, the Mexican painter who became Frida Kahlo\\'s husband, the color palette combinations of Josef Albers, the German artist who was the first to get solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art and the Met in New York, and the styles of her grandparents\\' house in Mexico City, which was designed by Architect Luis Barragán.\"I believe Barragán\\'s work is a study of the language of the colors of México,\" she says. \"Being surrounded by a wide palette definitely shaped my understanding of the interplay between colors and how colors affect emotions, which has impacted my designs greatly.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.When it comes to creating designs now, Goldstein uses her own style and life as inspiration. Because she uses her hands for work —through manicures and jewelry design (did we mention she owns two brands, Doublemoss Jewelry and Doublemoss Arte?) —she found that short nails are the most functional.How to Shape Short NailsGoldstein explains that shaping has the biggest impact on creating the illusion of longer nails. She\\'s a big fan of the tapered oval and square shapes but recommends avoiding flat square nails because they can make your nails look shorter. In terms of trends, every design can look good on short nails, Goldstein says, citing French tips and negative space nails as examples, but it\\'s the way the design is styled that matters.\"If you do a thick, flat French tip, it makes your short nail look shorter,\" she says, opposed to a daintier, more curved tip. \"Negative space nails work wonders for shorter nails. A clean sheer base helps minimize the attention on the nail and focus on the art.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Celebrities Who Love Short NailsWhen navigating designs with clients, Goldstein\\'s biggest goal is to make sure the nails complement the entire look, especially when doing celebrity nails for red carpet events (her résumé includes several Met Galas, U.S. press for The Batman, and The Academy of Motion Pictures Museum Opening Gala, but no big deal).Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I never want the nail art to take over,\" she says. \"Nail art is not for everyone, and I like to respect that by never pushing it on any of my clients.\"Goldstein also enjoys how collaborative the nail art process can be, naming her method with Gemma Chan, whose nails she did for the Met Gala in 2019 and 2021 and The Eternals premiere in London, as an example.\"I create a design based on what she is wearing and then consult Gemma for any tweaks or changes,\" she says. \"I love that Gemma isn\\'t scared to take risks with nails and respects the art.\"Goldstein is making major strides in bringing short nails back, and we\\'re obsessed with all of her designs. To sum it all up, we\\'d say she\\'s nailing it.

To be real, anything \"boiling over\" on our face is something we\\'d like to avoid.According to the National Eczema Association, 31.6 million people in the U.S. have some form of eczema, making it one of the most common skin conditions. If you\\'re experiencing red, irritated skin on your face (especially your eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, or chin), there\\'s a fairly good chance it\\'s facial eczema. You may already have it elsewhere on your body, or it could be on your face alone. And while there is no study evaluating the prevalence of facial eczema, specifically, New York City-based dermatologist Neil Sadick, MD, says he believes the disorder affects about a third of the population.With facial eczema, you\\'ll have to do a bit of detective work to identify what\\'s causing it. There are a few types — atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis being the two most common forms — and they act a little differently. Some types will resolve in a few weeks with treatment, while other cases are chronic and need constant management. But you\\'re not alone. There are solutions as well as ways to keep it under control.Facial eczema can be itchy, flaky, and frustrating — your face is usually the first thing people see — and with so many types of eczema to parse through, it can be overwhelming. To help, we spoke with several board-certified dermatologists to find out what exactly constitutes facial eczema, what triggers the condition, and most importantly, how to keep symptoms at bay.Meet the experts:Macrene Alexiades, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center of New York in New York City.Hadley King, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Anthony Rossi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Neil Sadick, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Adam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C.Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Read MoreBody & Mind GuideSymptoms, treatment options, and personal experiences for various physical, mental, and health conditions and concerns.ArrowIn this story:What Is Facial Eczema?Causes of Facial EczemaHow to Prevent Facial EczemaHow to Treat Facial EczemaShould I Treat Facial Eczema Differently Than I Would Eczema on My Body?What Should I Do if Over-The-Counter Products Aren\\'t Cutting It?What Is Facial Eczema?\"Eczema is an inflammation of the skin caused by either an allergen or irritant,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Anthony Rossi, MD. It can also be genetic, and triggered by irritants.Facial eczema has many different symptoms that can manifest themselves differently from person to person, but some common things to look for are red patches, itchy skin, stinging, and dryness. With darker skin tones, it also tends to be scaly, says Dr. Rossi.Eczema is a common condition that can appear anywhere on the body, but if you\\'re grappling with facial eczema, it\\'s likely on the eyelids, eyebrows, cheeks, or chin. And while it is common, you definitely should bring it to your dermatologist. \"Eczema that develops near the eyes needs special attention because the eyes themselves can be affected,\" adds Dr. Alexiades. \"Those with eczema around the eyes are more susceptible to certain eye problems such as conjunctivitis, inflamed cornea, and changes in the shape of the cornea, a condition called keratoconus.\"Causes of Facial EczemaThere are a few different types of facial eczema — which will be key in not just identifying what you\\'re dealing with, but how you treat it. The most common type of facial eczema is atopic dermatitis. \"Atopic dermatitis is genetic and flares can be triggered by dry environmental conditions, not moisturizing, stress, and allergies,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Hadley King, MD.The second type is contact dermatitis, which comes from exposure to an irritating substance or something you may be allergic to (common perpetrators are cosmetics, dyes, soaps, detergents, fragrance, or smoke — in addition to environmental allergens like pet dander or pollen). \"Some people break out in an eczema rash after eating certain foods, such as nuts, shellfish, milk, and eggs,\" says Dr. Alexiades.Try to note when you see an eczema flare and note any common denominators to your dermatologist. This should help both you and your dermatologist narrow it down and get to the root cause.How to Prevent Facial EczemaThe best way to prevent eczema on the face is the most obvious but perhaps the most important method: identify the trigger and remove it. \"For example, if you notice red patches when you wear jewelry, you may be allergic to nickel. Stop wearing jewelry and your eczema may go away,\" says Dr. Alexiades. \"If you notice red itchy patches after a night out, it may be perfume that is your trigger, in which case stop wearing fragrances and look for fragrance-free cosmetics.\"The same goes for cosmetics and skincare. \"Know what’s in your skincare and if you’re prone to allergies,\" says Dr. Rossi. It may be beneficial to go on a \"product diet.\" Pare down your routine to one gentle product (a cleanser is a good place to start) and add them back in slowly, one by one, to see if you can identify which product is causing your facial eczema. Patch testing—applying a small amount of a product to the sensitive skin on the inside of the arm to see if there is a reaction within 24 hours—can also help to narrow things down.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf you find that your flare-ups happen when you\\'re stressed, you may need to identify some lifestyle changes like taking on fewer projects, getting more rest, or finding more time for mindfulness. Likewise, if you notice that your facial eczema gets worse in dry or hot weather, try to plan ahead for AC breaks, come prepared with sunscreen, and find a thicker and more reliable moisturizer that can hang on all day.How to Treat Facial EczemaSometimes, simply removing your facial eczema triggers will totally cure your skin within weeks. But if your facial eczema is very severe and you can\\'t identify any bad actors, you may want to try over-the-counter hydrocortisone or get a topical steroid prescription from your dermatologist. \"A topical corticosteroid cream will help treat any of the causes of facial eczema,\" says Dr. King. “Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects.” They can be used as needed to treat flares but not for ongoing maintenance, according to the National Eczema Association, since prolonged use can cause withdrawal side effects like red, irritated skin and pimple-like papules.Dr. Rossi adds that antihistamines can be an effective short-term solution if the eczema is caused by an allergen. Otherwise, \"there are more systemic medications for severe or widespread cases,\" he says.How to Curb Flare-upsNot all types of eczema have a surefire \"cure,\" but you can definitely make it more manageable and lessen your flare-ups. You may be able to curb irritation with good lifestyle habits, over-the-counter products, and consistent skincare with gentle but moisturizing products.\"Good, gentle care of your skin is the most important aspect of treating facial eczema,\" says Dr. Alexiades, who recommends fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products if you find that you’re prone to flare-ups. \"Consider a mild cleanser and wash your face with lukewarm water, since heat can cause a flare-up.\"Dr. Alexiades also touts the benefits of keeping your skin hydrated. She recommends moisturizers with emollient ingredients like ceramides and cosmetics that also have moisturizing ingredients. \"Having facial eczema doesn’t mean you can never wear makeup, but not all products are the same,\" she says. \"Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and shea butter.\" Moisturizers and cosmetics with moisturizing ingredients (like hyaluronic acid and shea butter) can help to protect the outer skin barrier—which can be damaged or compromised by eczema, according to the National Eczema Association.Should I treat facial eczema differently than I would eczema on my body?Yes. Both Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, and Dr. Sadick recommend using milder products on your face because the skin is thinner and more sensitive than the skin on your body. \"I would use eczema skin-care products designed for face and body respectively as they contain different concentrations of active ingredients,\" says Dr. Sadick.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesAdam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., recommends using weaker topical steroids, as he says, \"facial skin is more sensitive to the skin thinning and lightening effect of topical steroids.\" According to a study by the National Eczema Association, prolonged use of strong topical steroids can cause a host of withdrawal symptoms once you stop using the cream—like burning, stinging, papules, or pimple-like bumps. However, short-term use is safe and effective with the guidance of a dermatologist.What should I do if over-the-counter products aren\\'t cutting it?Sadly, sometimes eczema on the face can prove extremely stubborn to the point where treatment may need to be prescribed by a doctor. \"If home treatments are not helping, you may need prescription medications,\" says Dr. Shah. \"I usually prescribe either a topical steroid or a topical calcineurin inhibitor, a non-steroidal medication that can reduce inflammation and treat eczema.\"Dr. Shah says she sometimes prescribes special moisturizers called barrier repair creams for patients. And if the eczema is severe and not responding to topical treatments, other options include phototherapy, aka light therapy. There\\'s a wide range of treatment options for facial eczema, so it often comes down to trial and error in order to figure out what works for you. We\\'d recommend always consulting your dermatologist before trying anything new.Read more about caring for skin conditions:6 Skin-Care Ingredients to Add to Your Routine If You Have EczemaHow to Treat Scalp Eczema, According to DermatologistsWhy Colloidal Oatmeal Should Be Part of Your Skin-Care RegimenYou can follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on all things beauty.', 'The 2022 Met Gala is here and back on the first Monday of May. This year, celebrities were challenged with the theme, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion,\" with an emphasis on gilded glamour. Tonight, stars are showing how they\\'re channeling the essence of the Gilded Age with black gowns, lengthy nails, and extravagant headpieces.The vintage waves and slicked-back chignons may be nice, but headpieces are the star of the show at this year\\'s version of the fashion event — and rightfully so. Simple headwear like bedazzled tiaras and golden headbands made their appearance alongside elaborate fascinators and massive hats. It\\'s clear that head coverings are key to the gilded glamour theme, and here are some of our favorite ones.Flaming DiscsGetty ImagesLa La Anthony arrived earlier in the night in a burgundy two-piece with a swirly manicure and a large red headpiece that captured our attention. On one side, there\\'s a large circular piece with red ovular pieces woven together. But, on the other side, the headpiece looks completely different — large and small candy apple-red roses shine, bringing this all-over red ensemble together.Hint of PinkGetty ImagesSarah Jessica Parker took our breaths away and clearly understood the gilded glamour assignment with her black-and-white Christopher John Roberts gown and detailed fascinator. This black netted piece covers part of her face, but it gets even better as your eyes travel up. Rolled pieces of black mesh pop out at the top alongside numerous strings with tiny diamond pieces in black and white. The fuchsia flower and leaves add a touch of color to this look that just makes sense.Abstract HaloGetty ImagesWinnie Harlow stepped on the carpet in a short abstract white dress topped with an intricate white-and-golden headpiece that we can\\'t quite describe. There\\'s thin golden rods that flow from the back of her head connecting to the clear-and-white, sharp abstract pieces that curl out from the sides of her head. This piece almost reminds us of the legs of an insect.Covered in SilverGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThis is far from the first headpiece Janelle Monáe has worn on the red carpet, and it won\\'t be the last one we ooooh and ahhhh over. The black-and-silver, striped hood connects to her bedazzled gown, which is the same color, and covers her entire head. It\\'s the epitome of glamour and excellence.Tiny TiarasGetty ImagesEmma Chamberlain was in the salon for hours the day before the Met Gala to achieve this light platinum blonde hair. Her blunt bob was parted down the middle and tucked behind her ears with a silver bedazzled tiara. This tiara isn\\'t in-your-face, but the delicate piece matches her studded accessories well.Pieces of GoldGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesTommy Dorfman made a statement with her hunter green, latex dress with black leather gloves. The small golden headband on her head complements the gold pieces on her cut-out dress. Tiny squarish shapes are all over the top of the headband.Birds of a Feather Getty ImagesQuannah Chasinghorse always brings her culture wherever she goes. For the Met Gala, she paired a large feather headpiece with a voluminous, baby blue tulle dress. The feathers were attached to intricate braids on one side of her head and look stunning with her jewelry.Bathed in WhiteGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesCynthia Erivo\\'s towering white headwrap references the Tignon Laws, which was a law in the late 1800s that forced Black women to cover their hair. The white wrap is also an ode to the many types of headwraps Black women wear around the globe. We\\'re loving the height and volume of this chalk-white headpiece.Wide BrimsGetty ImagesSZA was clearly embracing the saying \"go big or go home,\" with her hot pink gown, a massive black hat, and latex gloves and thigh-high boots. The sheer size of this hat was impressive, and we would love to know if it stayed put the whole night or if she had to take it off to avoid accidentally hitting someone. At the back of the hat is a fuzzy boa that reached below the singer\\'s waist.Sequins GaloreGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSequins and gems had a huge moment at the 2022 Met Gala. Jessica Chastain decided to shine in a long-sleeve, garnet gown with a silver snake that wrapped around the dress. She paired the look with a turban headband in the same red sequins as the dress for a matchy-matchy moment. The hair accessory also has a silver element with a jeweled brooch at the very center of her head — it\\'s lavish, glitzy, and flashy, which is apt for the glamourous theme.Netted VisionGetty ImagesClaire Danes\\'s slicked-back bob was accessorized with a black fascinator that covered most of her face and ears. This netted design was on the simpler side and almost looked like a bunch of small soda plastic rings woven together.One KnotGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesLily Aldridge is another celebrity who matched her entire outfit from head to toe. Her gown, gloves, and headscarf all had the same silver-studded black design. The bejeweled scarf was tied simply right below her neck for a chic but simple look.Golden GloryGetty ImagesNatasha Poonawalla did not skimp out on any gold on the red carpet. Her brown gown was covered in sequins and accessorized with several large gold pieces of jewelry. She even added a golden headband full of multicolored jewels in different sizes. But the main attraction was the golden corset-like piece that extends into a large headpiece. Three thin metal pieces formed a trio of circles around her head and neck, covering a portion of her face. Shorter pieces of gold curl outward on the rings matched the swirly metal on her chest area.With a TiltGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNormani arrived in a velvet black two-piece set with a brand new hair color.

On June 15, the icon announced that her seventh album, titled Renaissance, is dropping on July 29. Even though she alerted her fans of the upcoming music a month in advance — a striking difference from when she released her self-titled album in 2013 without any promotion — she still made sure to keep us on our toes by sharing the exciting news in the middle of the night and appearing on the July cover of British Vogue just a few hours later.This cover is nothing short of magnificent — and the Beyhive agrees. The \"Spirit\" singer looks like royalty sitting on top of a horse in an all-black Maison Alaia gown with a massive feather headpiece. The rest of the photo shoot is just as breathtaking and extravagant. In one image, she appears in another black outfit but with a leather jacket, black box braids that hairstylist Jawara twisted into what looks like Bantu knots, and a glossy black lip, painted by her longtime makeup artist, Sir John. She looks like the baddest person to ever live sitting on top of a motorcycle instead of a horse.The hair and headpieces were clearly a focal priority in this shoot. They are striking, futuristic, and risky. In a few photos, she has dark hair instead of her usual blonde-highlighted strands, which is making some fans wonder if Queen Bey will be returning to her brunette era for this new album.Getty ImagesBut there is one other hairstyle that is sparking some strong reactions from the Beyhive. The hairstyle in question is the choppy baby fringe she wears with a gilded Schiaparelli Haute Couture outfit and jewelry. These short bangs are far from Beyonce\\'s norm and took several Twitter fans back to 2014, one of the few other times we have seen her with baby bangs.If you don\\'t remember that fringe, let me jog your memory for a second — they were thick, very blunt, and super short, stopping several inches about her forehead. She wore similar bangs in her \\'60s-inspired music video for \"Why Don\\'t You Love Me,\" which was released four years prior. She also had a pair of those stubby bangs in a brunette shade in her \"Telephone\" music video with pop star Lady Gaga.screenshot of Beyoncé from “Telephone” video\\nCourtesy of UMG/InterscopeA few fans noted how the resurgence of these bangs indicated that the Houston singer\\'s upcoming music is about to be epic.One user tweeted side-by-side photos of the spiky bangs and her baby fringe from 2014 and, \"Beyoncé is NOT playing she brought the choppy bangs out.\" Another fan compared the two photos and commented, \"Beyoncé even resurrected the chopped and screwed bangs.

Another jokingly noted that the fringe was probably styled by one of her five-year-old twins. \"I love that Beyoncé always includes her kids in her work, the fact that she got rumi and sir to cut her bangs/style her hair,\" the tweet reads.Regardless of your feelings about the baby fringe, we\\'re sure you\\'re more than excited for the upcoming album — we definitely are. Some fans are thinking it\\'s going to include disco and house influences due to rumors about artists she is collaborating with and the overall vibe of the shoot; it blends retro elements, such as a giant disco ball and platform boots, and futuristic designs. We won\\'t fully know until July 29, but we\\'re sure that Beyoncé will deliver hits as she always has.Read more stories about bangs:21 Types of Bangs to Consider If You\\'re Ready to Take the PlungeBottleneck Bangs Are the New, Daintier Take on Curtain BangsYour Guide to Styling, Maintaining, and Growing Out Curtain BangsNow enjoy this pro-dancers entire daily routine:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'In our humble opinion, nothing beats the rush of getting a needle poked through your skin for a piercing. Among the various ways to express yourself through body modification, they\\'re relatively low risk and just plain ol\\' fun.Piercing trends tend to ebb and flow. Some locations, like the ear lobe, seemingly never go out of style while other placements, like the belly button, resurge in popularity every few years or so. The COVID-19 pandemic affected many folks\\' ability to get piercings as mask-covered areas became off-limits. But, as tattoo and piercing shops open back up, more people have been willing to experiment, whether it\\'s by adding new jewelry to old holes or getting something entirely new.We chatted with a few piercers to learn about all the ear and body piercing trends you should expect in the new year. Here are the piercing trends you\\'ll be seeing everywhere in 2022.Ear CurationsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyThe ear is a popular site for piercings, but recently more folks are seeking out ear curations, according to piercer Amber Maysonet who works at Live by the Sword Tattoo. \"It\\'s basically a mapping and planning for either now or future piercings for your ears,\" she explains. Ear curations involve giving the piercer the creative freedom to choose multiple piercings for you while taking into account your aesthetic and your ear\\'s anatomy to figure out the best placements and jewelry. Sometimes these curations also involve adding new jewelry to already existing piercings to ensure everything works together.Maysonet cites social media, especially TikTok, as the reason why she thinks more people are choosing these curations. \"When you look at [these piercings], especially on social media, you see how good everything goes together and how nice [they] look on somebody else, obviously you\\'re like, \\'OMG, I can do that,\\'\" she shares.At Brooklyn\\'s So Gold Studies, piercer and founder Cassi Lopez-March requires that clients have at least three existing piercings and be willing to get one to three additional piercings during an ear curation session. She finds that more of her clients are seeking out \"full-blown ear styling\" rather than coming in with pre-determined placements because the average person does not always know what they want. \"When someone gives us free reign to kind of have fun with it, that\\'s when the magic happens,\" she shares.OrbitalsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyIf you google \"orbital piercing,\" you\\'ll see a couple of different piercing locations, but don\\'t let the internet confuse you, Cassi Lopez-March says. \"An actual orbital is just one ring that connects two holes,\" she explains. You can get two new piercings or use new jewelry to connect older ones. She has noticed this placement becoming extremely popular with clients who want to refresh their old holes and give them a new life. At her shop, they tend to add orbitals to the lobe area to connect second or even third piercings.NavalCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2017, I fulfilled one of my childhood dreams of getting a belly button piercing. I remember a friend of mine was a bit shocked that I chose the location given that it was no longer \"popular.\" But it looks like I may have been ahead of the curve (and honestly, I don\\'t make my decisions on trends alone) because both Maysonet and Lopez-March see a resurgence in belly rings coming soon.Just like fashion and beauty trends, nostalgia is winning once again with piercings, seeing as belly rings had their last heyday in the 2000s. But Maysonet has seen folks adding a bit of a twist to the placement by getting both the top and bottom of their bellies pierced rather than choosing just one or the other.Flat HelixCourtesy of Instagram/@studsFolks are becoming more interested in receiving multiple piercings at once rather than just one. \"Right now, I think the piercing trends of 2022 are being influenced by the excitement and relief of returning to travel, celebrations, and concerts with new trends of bold self-expression,\" Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of piercing studio Studs where they focus exclusively on ear piercings, shares. That\\'s why she predicts that a trio of piercings on the flat helix will be big in the new year.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe flat helix is specifically the flat area of cartilage located in the upper ear. Bubbers says it\\'s a great spot because you can try out a few different types of jewelry options and have fun with customization. She\\'s also noticed an increase in asymmetrical placements, which can be done in this area.EyebrowGetty ImagesRecently, we\\'ve noticed certain celebrities with new eyebrow piercings — some fake, some real. On September 27, Lil Nas X showed off his new eyebrow piercing on TikTok to fans\\' praise. (Since then we haven\\'t really seen it make another appearance, so who knows if the jewelry was just a fake-out.)Cardi B debuted her own eyebrow piercing during Paris Fashion Week in one of the best ways possible. She showed out in an extravagant red Mugler dress and cape with bedazzled red brows and a silver ring through her left eyebrow. The eyebrow was a popular piercing location in the \\'90s and 2000s, and it seems like it will be reentering the mainstream in 2022.Snakebites/StacksCourtesy of Instagram/@ileanastabbedmeMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2019, Studs created their signature \"Snakebite\" piercing, which model Kaia Gerber helped make popular. The name may be a bit confusing if you\\'re used to the Snakebite lip piercing — which typically means two piercings spaced out at each outer corner of the lower lip — but this is an ear piercing that involves stacking two holes close together on the outer cartilage of the mid-ear area. Bubbers says they expect to see folks trying the piercing in new places like the Forward Helix and Conch in 2022.The jewelry in these holes is just as important as the piercings themselves. Scrolling through Studs\\'s Instagram, you\\'ll see ears full of these Snakebite piercings with gold and silver jewelry in all shapes and sizes.NosesCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMaysonet has also seen an increase in nose piercings, both on the nostril and the septum. She cites the resurgence of punk, alternative, and even scene aesthetics as the impetus for this rise. We\\'re also willing to bet that once mask mandates are lifted in certain areas that it will allow more people to finally try the piercing placement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesYou can get a simple septum or nostril piercing or go all out and try two piercings, whether that be with one hole in each nostril, two holes in one nostril, or a septum and nostril piercing. It\\'s up to you to decide what kind of fun you\\'re into.With the unpredictability of the past two years, there\\'s truly no knowing what will happen in the piercing world. But we are sure that more and more folks will continue to dip into creativity and give their piercer freedom to guide them along their piercing journey.Read more stories about body modification:Contraconch Piercings Are Gaining Popularity For Their Unexpected PlacementYour Complete Guide to Vulva PiercingsHow Your Belly Button Piercing Changes When You Get PregnantNow watch 100 years of piercings:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'It almost felt like the MTV VMAs were back to their pre-pandemic form tonight at the 2022 show. Nicki Minaj, LL Cool J, and Jack Harlow hosted and kept us entertained throughout the music-filled night. Minaj was even awarded the 2022 VMA Video Vanguard award, both exciting and well deserved. In addition to these three celebs, Lizzo, Bad Bunny, and Anitta all blessed the stage with their voices.The performances were amazing, and our eyes were zoned in on what these stars were wearing from head to toe, both on and off the stage. They were already wowing us with their massive feather headpieces, face jewelry, and slicked-back hair, but we were also obsessing over all the manicures. Here are just a few that we are loving.Dove CameronGetty ImagesDove Cameron went for dark grunge vibes at the awards show. She paired her strapless leather and floral gown with smoked-out burgundy eye makeup, plum glossy lips, and stiletto-shaped nails.

For example, there were deep red rose charms and silver gems on each middle finger. If you look closely, you might have noticed the black scissor decals on each ring fingernail.Betty WhoGetty ImagesThe Australian-born singer-songwriter showed up with black-and-white graphic nails. Each hand had different nail designs. On one hand, there were various sizes of white and black stars on each nail. The other hand had white hearts on the index and ring fingers. The white design on the middle finger was actually an ode to the awards show; it\\'s the iconic MTV logo.Monét X ChangeGetty ImagesMonét X Change had already caught over eyes with her large afro puffs and bright tropical-inspired makeup, but we made sure not to forget her white swirly tips.

Her bedazzled metallic nails practically blend into her dress in the above photo. The medium-length, almond-shaped nails were full of sparkly gems and jewels.Lil Nas XGetty ImagesNow, hearing the words \"goth Big Bird\" probably sounds like the strangest and worst thing in the world, but we swear Lil Nas X\\'s VMAs outfit will make you rethink that. The rapper showed out with a massive black feather headpiece with matching pants. It\\'s hard to take your eyes off this elaborate feather piece, but the mismatched manicure he wore that night also deserves some fanfare.OPI Nail Lacquer in Bubble Bath$11OPI Nail Lacquer in Black Onyx$11Two nails on each hand were painted completely black by nail artist Temeka Jackson who used OPI GelColor polishes, which are exclusively available to nail artists, to complete this look. Thankfully, the two shades she used, Bubble Bath (pale pink) and Black Onyx (pitch black), are available in nail lacquer form, so this look can be recreated at home. With the Black Onyx polish and a thin brush, she drew French tips, geometric shapes, and lines to create the nail art.Becky GGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesBecky G looked gorgeous in a sequined gown that looked just like a stained glass window.

The different clips stitched together show the model in a pink velvet bathing suit (ah, a true sign of an L.A. winter) with frosty pink eye makeup and matching pink butterfly clips pulling her hair back from her face.\"Todays vibe,\" the nonchalant caption reads, along with a couple of emojis. Throughout the video, Bieber smiles and makes duck faces while she shows off her look. Her hair is middle-parted and styled with natural beach waves and baby braids. As for makeup, she\\'s opted for layered pink eye shadow: a lighter shade on her inner lids, and a darker hue on her outer lids. Pink glitter serves as her eyeliner, which rims both lash lines and extends outward into a baby wing. The monochromatic look also features a rosy blush, a pink lip color, and soft highlighter on her cheek bones. We\\'re taking notes, and plan on channeling this look all spring long.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.For her nails, she\\'s staying on-trend with a classic French oval manicure so simple that it doesn\\'t take away from her finger tattoos.

She\\'s wearing a few necklaces, including mixed and matched pearls with a custom letter bead necklace (although we can\\'t read what it spells out), two belly chains, and gold hoop earrings.We love all of Hailey\\'s content (shout-out to her skin-care tips, pictures with Justin, and TikTok dances), but we can\\'t get enough of her glowing beauty looks, either.

And while it's all too common for some to slouch when it comes to following the theme of the night, one guest nailed it in the gilded glamor department at the 2022 Met Gala. Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers. It was shiny gold and covered in ruby and pearl-looking appliqués. She also sported a gold, armor-esque covering on her other pointer finger. The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore. Somehow, it was both a retro and futuristic look all at once. And one that set the hearts of internet critics aflame.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.King kept the rest of her beauty look simple, with cropped hair and minimal-looking makeup. Because why take attention away from the nail situation?

If that wasn\\'t enough, the \"Kiss Me More\" singer made our jaws drop with the stunning Schiaparelli black gown and gold accessories she wore for the awards show. By now we expect the pop star to capture our attention with every new look, but we didn\\'t expect her to show up to the event with short nails or intricate gold rings that look like they\\'re worth more than my student loans.The \"Say So\" singer didn\\'t hesitate to take risks for this look, something we love from her. Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas gave her a neutral smokey eye with a hint of bright yellow on the inner crease and waterline that complemented the daring gown very well. As for her hair, hairstylist Jared Henderson (known as JStay Ready to many) slicked her dark hair into a high ponytail with a flipped end that we have a good feeling was fun to whip around.Getty ImagesTypically Doja Cat wears lengthy nails, but for this look, she kept them short. Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe. But this manicure is anything but simple, because this opulent jewelry is basically nail art.Her middle finger had the largest ring, which covered her entire finger and nail. The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own. The other two rings were simpler, which is saying something.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one!

The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me.

One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade. As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says.

As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says.

Yep, it\\'s equally as disappointing when you find an eye-catching set of earrings only to find it\\'s made of materials that could irritate your skin. Sure, they say pain is beauty, but when that pain involves itchiness, redness, and uncomfortable rashes (on an already-thin and sensitive part of your skin, no less), it begs the question: \"were these hoops really worth it?\" The short answer is, well, no.And remember: you\\'ll know if your piercing is infected if it\\'s red, inflamed, sore, hot to touch, or if it\\'s releasing puss. You should consult with your physician if you suspect you have an infection.The truth is, if you\\'re someone who struggles with finding earrings that won\\'t cause discomfort, you may have to work a little harder to find your match. \"Unfortunately, sterling silver jewelry is made with a mix of metals, often nickel, which is the most significant irritant to sensitive ears,\" explains Ottawa-based medical director of Concept Medical Samuel Hetz, MD. \"Those with sensitive ears want to find hypoallergenic rhodium-plated jewelry with low to no nickel content.\" He recommends looking for the standard benchmarks of 14k gold or above as well as sterling silver 925 grade to reduce the chances of nickel content.Because we don\\'t believe those with sensitive skin should be left out of the party, we rounded up nine of the best earrings for sensitive ears that are always stylish, and never irritating.BaubleBar Sutara 18K Gold Earrings$48 at BaubleBar$42 at NordstromFor sensitive-skinned folks, Baublebar\\'s Sutara Earrings will make you thank your lucky stars they\\'re made out of 18k gold.

All around me were people filling in or touching up their ink, but I continued onward past the buzzing needles — straight to the back, where the piercer works. After a tough year, I was ready for a bit of body modification to memorialize the challenges and symbolize the jump forward into 2022. What I didn\\'t realize, as I asked for a third lobe piercing to continue to build my stack of hoops, is that my bright idea was of a pace with a wide new piercing trend.More and more customers are asking for what Alaina Rothstein, cofounder of Los Angeles ear piercing service Leo West, refers to as a \"milestone piercing.\" Rothstein has seen mothers and daughters come in for birthday piercing; she knows of a woman who miscarried and got a stud to remind her of the loss. \"It\\'s a fun, really beautiful way to carry something special with you in happy times and in sad times,\" she says. \"And I think it\\'s like super cool that it\\'s translated [from the tattoo world] into the piercing world.\"Our piercers have seen birthdays, bachelorette parties, and groups of friends come in to celebrate together. But what trends are they trying, specifically? In other words, which parts of the ear are getting the most adoration through adornment right now?Meet the experts:Alaina Rothstein and Jill Katz, RN, cofounders of Los Angeles ear-piercing service Leo WestLisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a piercing studio with locations in New York, Texas, and California (among others)Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer at Live by the Sword Tattoo in Brooklyn, New YorkIn This Story:Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?How to Pick Your PiercerConstellation PiercingsStacked LobesVertical StacksForward HelixSnakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)ConchOuter Conch, a.k.a. SconchJump ahead, or read on for everything you need to know about the freshest ear-piercing trends, as well as the estimated length of time the healing process may take.Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?Milestones are one reason customers are flocking to their local licensed piercer, but another is a generalized sense of freedom and autonomy that\\'s arrived as a result of the pandemic. \"With remote work and workplace norms overall changing, more people are feeling free to experiment with bolder looks and express their personality,\" says Lisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a national piercing studio. That experimentation shows up both in the amount of piercings and in the piercings themselves, which are getting \"more creative,\" Bubbers says. (Plus, as Rothstein points out, \"one fun thing about mask-wearing is that your ears show.\")The last \"really important trend,\" as Leo West cofounder Jill Katz, RN describes it, is \"adorning what you got.\" There\\'s no normal, she says. A gorgeous earscape is all about working with your budget and your anatomy to create an embodiment of your style in tiny, beautiful silver, gold, or gem form.The result: forward helices, vertically stacked lobes, conches, sconches, snake bites, and plenty of other piercing types we never knew existed, spanning from the outer rims of the ear to the inner cartilage and back to the earlobe. Our trend-spotting piercers shared the adornments they\\'ve seen grow more popular over 2022, and what they envision for the years (and ears!) to come.How to Pick Your PiercerJust as with microblading, filler, or any other body modification, it\\'s important to find a professional piercer that you trust, with a style that appeals to you. This is an essential step, whether you’re a longtime body modification fan or it’s your first piercing ever.As Brooks notes, the benefit of following a piercer on social media is that you can seek them out and, as in one service she offers, put your ear(s) in her hands. During a \"curation\" appointment, the expert will look at your ear as a whole and help design multiple piercings to fit your style and your desires.At Leo West, that might look like getting multiple differentiated piercings on each ear. \"Symmetry is out,\" says Rothstein. As she points out, a specialist is extra helpful if you\\'re nervous about curating an asymmetrical look. \"It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t want ears that match, but it has to have a rhyme or reason to it,\" she says. \"I have two ears, and I like to say ‘one’s a little bit classy, one\\'s a little bit sassy.\\'\"Constellation PiercingsInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhile some of this year\\'s trends include holes in unexpected places, more of them involve third, fourth, or fifth additions to an already-pierced ear. At Leo West, the result is what they\\'ve named a \"constellation.\" A constellation consists of \"really small pieces, close together, closer than what your traditional spacing would be,\" explains Rothstein. The result is an \"intentionally random\" grouping of ear piercings that show off studs and gems.Stacked LobesInstagram user @leowestco\"People often come in [to the studio] and say \\'I’m not cool enough,\\'\" for a trendy piercing, recounts Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer in Brooklyn. If you\\'re intimidated by the thought of a conch piercing or even a constellation, Brooks thinks that an ear stack is an easier entry point. These piercings are less painful than their cartilage-filled brethren, and can make their way up the lobe either evenly spaced or placed close together.Vertical StacksInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"If I\\'m being honest, I love to put my hair behind my ear to show the little pops of pieces sitting right above your classic [piercing],\" laughs Rothstein. She\\'s referring to a vertical stack, which entails a piercing centered directly above your traditional first or second hole. It\\'s usually filled with a small stone or a small star, Rothstein\\'s favorite. This piercing does require a certain amount of space on the lobe, but if you have enough canvas to play with, it \"gives the ear a little extra uniqueness.\"Forward Helixcourtesy of StudsThe official name for that bouncy piece of cartilage where your ear meets your skull is the \"forward helix.\" According to Bubbers, customers are coming in requesting one or even multiple piercings on the forward helix. \"We do see new and different piercing trends emerge each year based on what’s trending in fashion, culture, and celebrity,\" she says. Celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Chantal Jeffries have helped popularize the new (and finicky — helix piercings can take up to nine months to heal) style.Snakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)In the realm of body piercing, the term \"snakebite\" typically refers to two piercings on either side of your lower lip, oftentimes barbells or studs.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen it comes to ears, however, it entails two holes placed close together, slightly separated from the rest of your ear piercings, giving the impression of that your piercer just might have used two fangs to get the job done. According to Bubbers, most customers opt for a snakebite in their “midi,\" the center point of the outer ear.ConchInstagram user @leowestcoWe\\'ve named conch piercings as of-trend for the past few years, but the cartilage piercing is still popular enough to remain on the list. It pierces through the inner-ear cartilage that makes up the back of the year. At Studs, Bubbers says customers are opting more and more for a snakebite on the conch for a doubly trendy effect.Outer Conch (Sometimes Known as a \"Sconch\")courtesy of Studs\"I hope you don\\'t use this name,\" laughs Brooks. She prefers the more medical-sounding \"outer conch,\" but the phrase \"sconch\" is catching on to describe a piercing placed at the lining ridge in the cavern space close to the center of the ear.\"It\\'s right in your eye-line when people look at you,\" she says, so it provides a way to show a bit of personality even when you\\'re on Zoom or wearing a mask. Because it\\'ll be eye-catching no matter what kind of earring(s) you have in, Brooks likes adorning an outer conch piercing with a piece of jewelry that makes a big statement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesMore on the world of piercings:How Tongue Piercings Work, From Pain Level and Placement to Aftercare and Healing TimeHow to Remove Every Type of Piercing at Home8 Types of Ear Piercings, ExplainedContraconch Ear Piercings Are Gaining Popularity for Its Unexpected PlacementIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?

That way, I have a scent memory anchored to that destination or time period for whenever I choose to relive it. My last international trip, to a prestigious wellness resort in Austria for some on-the-ground reporting, demanded a very specific choice: something compact enough to fit in my carry-on without getting tossed by TSA, calming enough to match the vibe of the Alpine oasis, and extra long-lasting so it would last through hikes, meals, and medical treatments without reapplication. Lastly, it would need to smell expensive, because my fellow wellness-seekers would expect as much — but we\\'ll get to that later.After much deliberation, I landed on a luxe new formula that had just hit my desk before my flight: the Jennifer Fisher My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil.My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil$65I was initially surprised that Jennifer Fisher, a jewelry designer beloved by her red carpet clientele and the master behind some of Jennifer Lopez\\'s favorite hoop earrings, had ventured into perfumery. That said, fragrance does feel like a sparkling accessory that amps up any outfit or beauty look, and Fisher wanted her new perfume oil to make a statement for the wearer. \"I want anyone wearing My Scent to feel confident and sexy,\" she tells Allure. “And to smell like a fresh baked cookie.\" Upon first wear, I didn\\'t flag baked goods as a top note, but I did instantly fall for the vanilla and coconut Fisher knew she wanted to include in the formula.\"The blend of vanilla and coconut brings back memories from my childhood growing up in Santa Barbara, California,\" she says. \"For years, I was combining different vanilla and coconut fragrances to try and create my own personal scent. Finding a scent that was a combination of surf wax from the beaches in my hometown, Montecito, and a fresh baked cookie is what I\\'ve always wanted.\"Australian sandalwood, pear, and Tonka bean flank the creamy hero notes, and it all comes together to smell equal parts sunny and cozy, like throwing on a cashmere sweater on a breezy summer night. Toting it around is just as effortless too: I carried the teeny-tiny rollerball in my airplane carry-on, my spa robe to and from massages and lunch, and even in my fanny pack while Nordic walking in the mountains.No, really, I took this tube everywhere with me.\\nTaylore Glynn\"I wanted to come out with something small, compact, and portable you could throw in your bag and take everywhere with you,\" says Fisher. \"A spray to me didn\\'t feel as transportable, but that doesn\\'t mean I am ruling it out for the next product. This oil was designed intentionally to be worn and carried on-the-go.\" In addition to being totable, the formula also fulfilled my need for something that would last through spa treatments and saunas.\"Coconut is a good oil carrier to round out scents,\" says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, noting that scent can last longer in oil form because it\\'s not watered down. \"Atomized scents usually contain alcohol to help spraying. Fragrance oil is the most concentrated form [you can find].\"The scent was so powerful that even my fellow resort guests noticed. In fact, I was flagged down multiple times in the dining room and in the halls to reveal what I was wearing because it smelled \"beautiful\" and \"divine.\" For important context, some of the resort guests on the premises at the time — who I can\\'t explicitly identify — included one of the most famous supermodels of our generation, an Oscar-winning actress, and an entirely different famous jewelry designer with whom I chatted about ketamine therapy. I realized that My Scent smelled flat-out expensive, which seems to be a selling point amongst perfume enthusiasts on social media. In fact, there\\'s a whole genre of #FragranceTok posts dedicated to perfumes that make you smell, well, rich. After studying these videos, there\\'s a handful of perfumes that seem to universally smell like wealth: Parfums de Marly Delina, Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Montale Paris Intense Cafe, and three different Maison Francis Kurkdjian perfumes.Courtesy of brandParfums de Marly Delina$335Courtesy of brandYves Saint Laurent Libre Eau de Parfum Spray$140 $112 at NordstromIntense Cafe Eau de Parfum$170Courtesy of brandMaison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540$325They all also happen to share one intoxicating note: vanilla, which lies at the heart of My Scent.

Well, we say it's time to take a moment to appreciate such bold choices, such as Doja Cat's quirky makeup looks from Paris Fashion week — she still has us wondering how her shirt remained white with all that gold. And we certainly can't leave out the Hadid sisters' bleached brows for their own prance down the very same runways. It's not much of a shocker, then, that Gigi Hadid went for something a bit odd and definitely bold for a recent red-carpet beauty moment. For the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards on November 7, Hadid graced the carpet with an unconventional cool gray lipstick.I'll be the first to admit that I did a double-take at first glimpse. No, it's not your typical choice where a lipstick shade is concerned, but makeup artists Patrick Ta and Akina Shimizu were able to pull off this muted-yet-fresh-faced makeup look on Hadid. Catch me zooming in on those lips that are seemingly matte and glossy at the same time. We're definitely not the only ones hoping the details will soon be dropped on what particular beauty brand this lipstick is made by. Nonetheless, this all-American color pallet is insanely cohesive.Let's also not forget the striking blonde hair color and the sleek, slicked-back bun hair stylist Laura Polko put together to bring out the jewelry on Hadid's ears and nose. My favorite part is the septum ring paired with the tartan-patterned Thom Browne attire styled by Mimi Cuttrell — it's full-on grunge. I'm honestly tempted to break out my alternative pop-rock playlist, like, now.

The supermodel went for a runway-ready vibe for both of her costumes this year, though they were extremely different in tone.For her first look, Bieber covered herself in roses to pay homage to an Yves Saint Laurent haute couture runway look from 1999, originally worn by model Laetitia Casta. In her carousel of pics, Bieber wears a top and miniskirt made of huge pink roses, enhanced by a matching pink organza ruffled train at her hips. Roses also pop up on one ankle and serve as a flower crown atop her head. The look is very The Birth of Venus but make it fashion —and floral.Bieber let the roses be the centerpiece of her costume and kept her hair and makeup subtle and natural with radiant \"glazed\" skin, deep rose lips, and a hint of shimmery pink eye shadow, then finished off the costume with a pale pink and white manicure. She wore no jewelry or accessories other than her engagement diamond and a pair of pale pink ankle-strap sandals. While Casta wore the rose look with Raphaelite ringlet curls, Bieber decided on loose brunette waves for a more modern approach. I just have one question, Hailey: Are those real roses? Hopefully, you de-thorned them if so!Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Later on during Halloweekend, Bieber ditched the angelic florals of her first costume in favor of something darker: a \"Versace Vampire.\" The model donned a strappy black bustier top and high-waisted black skirt with a black and gold Versace logo belt, opera-length shiny black latex gloves, and a pair of vampire fangs for the Goth-inspired vampire moment. A black wig, bright purple eyeshadow, flushed cheeks, and blood-red lips (obviously), plus chunky gold necklaces and huge gold and pearl earrings added to the glamourous \\'90s Versace vibe; she could have walked right off a Gianni Versace runway, minus the fangs.Instagram/Hailey BieberThe two looks may have been complete opposites, but they paid homage to Bieber\\'s fashion roots in the most gorgeously spooky and stunning way.More celeb Halloween looks you may have missed:The Kardashian\\'s Halloween Costumes Included Mystique, Bride of Frankenstein and Jessie from Toy StoryYou Have to See Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly as Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee for HalloweenMegan Thee Stallion Has Outdone Herself in the Halloween Nail Art DepartmentMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNow, learn Hailey\\'s 10 biggest beauty tips:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'TikTok-turned-reality star Dixie D\\'Amelio finally committed to the hairstyle she\\'s been longing for since sixth grade.

You can find plenty of examples across social media. Just look to hashtags #tonguepiercing and #tonguepiercings on TikTok and Instagram, which have over 790 million views and 520,000 posts, respectively.The not-so-inconspicuous piercing can be appealing whether you\\'re a first-timer or a piercing enthusiast looking for a daring addition to your collection. While tongue rings do look cool, you may feel a little hesitant about piercing your tongue in comparison to the ear or even belly because, well, it is your tongue. The stakes seem higher and more dangerous should an infection occur.But despite the location, the aftercare for tongue piercings is actually a lot easier (and a lot less painful) than some would expect. Here\\'s everything you need to know before scheduling your piercing appointment, whether you\\'re undecided about taking the plunge or ready to get your tongue pierced tomorrow.Meet the experts:Jenna Myers, a piercer at Live By the Sword Tattoo in New York CityErich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone HealthLynn Loheide, a body piercer based in Nashville, TennesseeAre tongue piercings dangerous?Before you even think about setting up your appointment, it\\'s important to understand the risks associated with tongue piercings. Like any piercing, there\\'s always a possibility of infection or rejection.Sometimes the signs of infection can be easy to confuse with irritation in piercings, especially if you\\'re extra paranoid. But New York City-based piercer Jenna Myers says that there tends to be a pretty big distinction between the two.\"[With an] infection, your tongue is going to look absolutely wild,\" Myers shares. \"It\\'ll be two to three times the size, turning almost green or white, [with puss].\" When that happens, she always advises going to the ER for professional help. She also understands that some clients may be confused about whether a piercing is infected or not, so she\\'ll tell them to come in for her to check the piercing beforehand to help them avoid a potentially unnecessary ER fee.Erich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone Health, notes that pus, severe tongue swelling, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and difficult breathing indicate that it\\'s time to seek out a medical professional. Typically, infected piercings are usually treated with antibiotics and the removal of jewelry, he explains.But there are some rare cases where surgery might be needed to drain an abscess or deal with any other complications, according to Dr. Voigt. For example, he once had to perform an emergency surgery on a patient because their tongue started to fill with blood and swell, leading them to choke. \"Fortunately, I was able to take the person to the operating room, remove the piercing (which was difficult because half of it became incorporated into the swollen tongue), incise the tongue, tie off a bleeding artery and well as cauterize the muscles, and then suture the tongue back together,\" Dr. Voigt shares.Luckily, not every tongue piercing will become infected. Still, it\\'s important to note that regardless of placement, the piercing can cause damage to the teeth and gums, according to piercer Lynn Loheide and Dr. Voigt. \"You need to understand that going into it, be okay with that risk, and also know what you have to do to minimize that risk,\" Loheide shares.Are horizontal \"snake eyes\" tongue piercings safe?Speaking of placement, there are restrictions as to where the tongue piercing can go. You might have heard of snake eyes before. For those who are unfamiliar, this style typically refers to a horizontal tongue piercing at the tip of the tongue. And if you had hopes of getting that piercing, keep dreaming. Unfortunately, experts say that tongue piercings should only go vertically through the tongue because horizontal placement comes with a big risk of damage to the teeth and gum recession.\"When we\\'re piercing vertically, especially in the center, we\\'re piercing through a connective tissue between those muscles,\" Loheide explains. \"But when you\\'re piercing horizontally, you\\'re actually pinning those muscles together, and that can cause a lot of damage.\" They also note that in the state of Oregon, horizontal tongue piercings are banned for this reason.Can anyone get a tongue piercing?Though everyone\\'s tongue is different, Loheide says if your tongue is too short or you have a tongue-tie — which is basically when the webbing underneath your tongue comes almost or all the way to the tip — a tongue piercing is probably not the best option for you.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen you arrive at your appointment, don\\'t be surprised if the piercer starts analyzing your mouth. In fact, that\\'s a good sign because your unique anatomy will dictate where you can and can\\'t get pierced, and any reputable piercer will ensure to take that into account, Loheide shares.\"We want to see where the blood flow is along the underside of the tongue and make sure that we\\'re not too close to it,\" they explain. \"But we also want to look at the shape of someone\\'s teeth and someone\\'s mouth when we\\'re deciding placement.\" That way, a piercer can ensure that they aren\\'t causing unnecessary damage and that the jewelry won\\'t rub up uncomfortably against your teeth.What can I expect during a tongue piercing appointment?Before your appointment, it\\'s imperative that you brush your teeth and tongue before arriving. Myers shares that typically her clients are given mouthwash right before to help clean their mouths out.As mentioned above, most of your appointment will be spent on prepping and checking your tongue before the needle is inserted. The actual piercing part of the session is short, just like most other piercings — a hollow needle is pushed through the tongue, and then the piercer adds the jewelry, which is a barbell shape.For standard tongue piercings, the ring is usually in the center of the tongue. Though horizontal piercings are a big no-no, you can still get two vertical tongue piercings. Some may call them venom piercings, but Loheide prefers to just refer to them as paired tongue piercings because for some people venom refers to two horizontal piercings, and the slang terms used change over time.\"Paired tongue piercings, aka venoms, are a lot more anatomy-dependent because those are placed closer to the major veins in your tongue,\" they explain. \"So we have to make sure that there\\'s space around that blood flow for them to be placed safely.\"Like any piercing, you should expect pain, and though it\\'s subjective, Loheide and Myers both swear that a tongue piercing is not as bad as you might think. \"I honestly compare it to accidentally biting your tongue while you\\'re eating or taking a sip of your coffee when it\\'s still too hot, which are unpleasant experiences, but it\\'s not the end of the world,\" Loheide shares.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn fact, they say that the most uncomfortable part is having the piercer\\'s hands in your mouth for an extended amount of time. Myers notes that on a scale of one to 10, most of her clients rate standard tongue piercings between a one to three, and paired tongue piercings a three to five.What does aftercare for a tongue piercing look like?There are a few things to expect immediately after your piercing. If you\\'ve been pierced before, some of these won\\'t be too shocking, but there are certain effects that are specific to tongue piercings.Right after your appointment, expect your tongue to be a bit swollen and painful for about one to two weeks, according to Loheide. That\\'s naturally going to happen because the piercing is a fresh wound. In addition to the pain and swelling, you\\'ll also deal with a slight lisp or change in how you speak. \"After about a week, the swelling will go down, and then the rest of the healing process is pretty easy,\" they share.Myers estimates that for a single tongue piercing, it will take about one to three months and three to five for paired piercings. \"Because the tongue is so vascular, it has a lot of blood flow to it, so it heals really quickly,\" she says. On the other hand, Loheide says to expect it to take about three to five months to be fully healed.Thankfully, the aftercare for tongue piercings isn\\'t too complicated. In general, maintaining good oral hygiene — brushing your teeth regularly and flossing — is important. Once you get home, Loheide recommends immediately changing out your toothbrush for a new one and using milder oral hygiene products. They advise avoiding toothpaste with whitening ingredients.Both piercers strongly suggest using an alcohol-free mouthwash that won\\'t burn your mouth. Loheide likes Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse because it doesn\\'t taste as badly as some alcohol-free mouthwashes do, it\\'s affordable, and can be found in most drug stores. Myers also recommends sterile saline solution, which tends to be recommended for most piercings.Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse$10Apart from switching up your oral products, you may have to change what you eat, but only for a short while. Myers suggests avoiding spicy, crunchy, and acidic foods in the first few weeks to avoid irritation. \"Things that you wouldn\\'t [want on] a paper cut, basically, you don\\'t want to eat the first few weeks of a tongue piercing, because it will cause serious discomfort,\" she says.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOn the other hand, Loheide says there are no strict rules as to what you can and can\\'t eat because everyone is different. But you still have to be mindful of how your mouth and tongue feel when you do eat or drink certain things. \"If you go to eat something and you\\'re like, \\'Wow, this feels terrible to eat,\\' don\\'t keep eating it,\" they share.Ultimately, try to not go overboard with your piercing aftercare, because that could potentially case more irritation. \"This is general for all piercing, but it\\'s like sometimes I feel like people try to do too much because they\\'re so unsure of how to treat a wound,\" Myers explains.\" Being as simple as possible with your aftercare is really best. Your body is really good at healing itself.\"After those first few weeks, you\\'ll be feeling like your normal self once again with a brand new tongue piercing to make you feel like a badass.Read more stories about piercings:7 Piercing Trends That Will Be Everywhere in 2022How to Remove Every Kind of Piercing Jewelry at HomeIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?Now enjoy the unboxing of the April 2022 Allure Beauty Box:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'Doja Cat is ready to travel to a galaxy far, far away.

Popularized in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, the timing for this resurgence makes sense: We\\'re already sticking Y2K-inspired rhinestones on our faces, breaking out the frosted eye shadow, and revisiting \"thong jeans\" so low-rise they would make even Paris Hilton blush. It was only a matter of time before bonding Swarovski crystal butterflies to our enamel made a comeback, too.Dental bling may be one of this year\\'s biggest beauty trends, but it\\'s nothing new. Anthropological records show that dentists as far back as the Mayan Empire decorated teeth with jade, gold, and turquoise, according to Anjali Rajpal, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California, nicknamed \"The Diamond Dentist\" on account of the bejeweled designs she creates for her celebrity clientele.Tooth jewelry also has significance in Black culture — a well-known example is grills, which were first worn by West Indian immigrants in the \\'70s and \\'90s hip-hop artists. Grills are decorative covers made of gold, silver, or encrusted with jewels that snap over one or more teeth and are removed at the end of each day. Tooth gems as we know them today differ from grills, but it\\'s important to recognize the cultures they\\'re derived from.Instead of a mouthful of precious metal, tooth gems are usually a single or a few delicate multi-colored gems or diamonds that are bonded individually to the teeth. Pinterest is clearly here for the trend, with the site reporting an 85 percent uptick in searches for \"tooth gems\" last year alone, while TikTok views for the hashtag #toothgems currently stand at 130.4m. \"Tooth gems add a little edge to someone\\'s style and are a less invasive way to make a statement than a tattoo,\" Dr. Rajpal tells Allure.Aesthetics aside, what about the dental health implications of these tiny adornments? We asked experts to share how tooth gems can be applied, and cared for, safely.Meet the Experts:Anjali Rajpal, DMD, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California.Michael Apa, DDS, an aesthetic dentist in New York City.Brian Kantor, DDS, a cosmetic dentist in New York City.How are tooth gems applied?Everyone\\'s bite is different, so there\\'s no avoiding a consultation first – sorry, dentist\\'s orders. \"[A consultation appointment] is also an opportunity to take my client\\'s style and personality into account when collaborating with them for their jewelry design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.If you\\'re choosing a semi-permanent tooth gem, no drilling is required: The technique is similar to the way braces are applied. \"An acidic solution (or etching gel) is placed on the tooth\\'s surface, microscopically roughening the enamel, before the gemstone is bonded to it with an adhesive and curing lamp,\" explains New York City-based aesthetic dentist Michael Apa. The whole process only takes a matter of minutes and is painless, provided the gem is bonded to the surface of a healthy tooth, Dr. Apa says. \"If you\\'ve got worn-away enamel from grinding your teeth or eating too many acidic foods, there will likely be sensitivity,\" he adds.Permanent tooth gems do require drilling a hole in the desired location, so be ready for the commitment if you\\'re planning on getting this adornment because it won\\'t be easy to remove. Also worth noting: While tooth gems can be bonded to veneers, Dr. Apa says they can\\'t be worn with Invisalign.How much do tooth gems cost?There\\'s no one-size-fits-all price tag. The cost will largely depend on your choice of design and materials (a Swarovski crystal, for example, will be cheaper than a diamond). Some dentists charge two separate fees – one for the gemstone and another for the application. \"My in-office fees include both and can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the size, quality, and quantity of the stones and the nature of the design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.How long do tooth gems last?Most tooth gems are semi-permanent and can last anywhere between six months to one year, says Brian Kantor, a cosmetic dentist in New York City. The right aftercare and dental materials used to bond the gemstone to the tooth will help you get the most out of your new dental jewelry.\"For the first 24 hours after getting a tooth gem, you should only eat soft foods and avoid using an electric toothbrush or drinking soda, coffee, or tea to protect the fresh bond,\" says Dr. Kantor, adding that picking or playing with your tooth gem is also off-limits. Sometimes a tooth gem may fall off on its own if you bite down hard on something, but Dr. Kantor says not to worry: \"There\\'s no harm to your tooth if that happens and the gem can simply be re-attached.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSemi-permanent tooth gems can also be safely removed by a dentist if you change your mind or want to switch up the design. “The gem is simply polished off along with any adhesive on the tooth,\" says Dr. Rajpal. As for permanent tooth gems, though, be warned that removing a permanent tooth gem that was inserted into a tooth will leave a hole. \"This hole will then need to be filled in with a white filling material that is color-matched to the existing shade of the tooth,\" adds Dr. Rajpal.Are tooth gems safe?If you ask Dr. Apa, tooth gems are purely an accessory. \"They\\'re a very specific aesthetic choice because they don\\'t offer the restorative benefits that come with veneers or crowns,\" he says. On top of not offering any benefits, there are a few dental risks that come with getting a set of gems.\"Tooth gems can trap plaque and create places for stray food particles and harmful bacteria to hide,\" Dr. Kantor explains. Needless to say, keeping the gem clean and practicing good oral hygiene is essential if you want to avoid gum inflammation, decay, or other dental issues. Alongside regular flossing, Dr. Apa recommends brushing twice a day with a non-abrasive toothpaste and soft bristle sonic toothbrush \"because the vibration offers a deeper clean and dislodges food stuck to the gemstone,\" he says.The bottom line? In general, as long as a dentist applies your chosen gem, and you\\'re taking proper care of your teeth at home, \"the risks are minimal,\" Dr. Apa says. In the wrong hands, he warns you could end up getting a gem with a rough surface that can cause traumatic lesions on the inside of the lip. \"Or if the gem isn\\'t placed properly, you can break an opposing tooth when you bite down,\" he cautions.So, I shouldn\\'t try applying tooth gems at home?Nope! Advice from dentists hasn\\'t stopped folks from taking the DIY route with nail art gems and superglue, but it should. \"It sounds obvious, but nobody should be ingesting toxic glue,\" insists Dr. Rajpal, who prefers to work with biocompatible materials such as gold and precious or semiprecious stones. \"Besides, glue doesn\\'t properly bond the gem to the tooth structure as well as dental materials,\" she explains. \"It\\'s far safer for a tooth gem to be applied by an experienced dentist, using a non-toxic material and polished to avoid any bacterial traps, as it will last longer, be more comfortable and hygienic.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesFor the same reason, Dr. Apa recommends a dentist remove the gem to avoid accidentally stripping away healthy enamel or tooth structure. \"You shouldn\\'t DIY anything in dentistry,\" he says. \"Tooth gem application is a dental procedure, and all procedures should be performed by a professional.\"More stories to take a bite into:I Took on Credit Card Debt to Get Braces as an AdultDentists Reveal the Correct Order to Brush Your Teeth, Floss, and Use MouthwashHow to Deal With Teeth Grinding and Jaw ClenchingNow, see how dental care has evolved over the last 100 years:', 'The 2022 MTV VMAs have barely even begun, and Lizzo is already stealing the show. The \"About Damn Time\" singer arrived at the awards show in an ensemble that was almost as dark as the black carpet she walked on. She looked like she could be princess of the underworld or even a gothic cake topper with her massive navy blue gown, dark lipstick, and golden rings on her ears, fingers, and lips.Where do you even start with a look like this? The singer\\'s navy blue gown was a gorgeous rumpled, off-the-shoulder dress from Jean Paul Gaultier. She paired it with sheer navy blue gloves that covered her forearms.Her golden jewelry was as excessive as her stunning gown in all the best ways possible. On both of her ring fingers, she wore an abstract looped ring. Earrings of various sizes covered her entire cartilage and lobe. The rings along her cartilage were thicker in width but smaller in circumference, so they hugged her ear. The hoops on the lobe were much larger, nearly skimming her shoulders. The last ring lay in the middle of her bottom lip.Getty ImagesThe lip ring combined with the dark blue lipstick and slicked back, wet-looking hair gave this look an edgier vibe that fit right in at the VMAs. Makeup artist Alexx Mayo was responsible for this glam makeup and matte lip. He painted her lips with Charlotte Tilbury\\'s Rock N Kohl liner in Bedroom Black and Eye Colour Magic Liner Duo in Super Blue to create the deep navy blue hue.Hairstylist Shelby Swain, who often works with the pop star, gave Lizzo\\'s wig the wet look using Matrix\\'s Instacure Anti-Breakage Porosity Spray and Vavooom Extra Full Freezing Spray. For the simple baby hairs, Swain used Matrix\\'s Overachiever Paste 3-in-1 Cream to keep the swoops in place.It was hard to see her nails beneath her mesh gloves, but the almond-shaped claws were painted with silver nail polish by nail artist Eri Ishizu. She used OPI\\'s GelColor in Clean State as a base before adding Chrome Effects in Mixed Metals to create an iridescent finish. Those two products are exclusive to nail artist pros, but OPI\\'s Nail Lacquer in Clean Slate and Infinite Shine in Silver on Ice work as replacements.Getty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf this was just her arrival look, we can\\'t wait for what she\\'s going to be wearing on stage when she performs.

The Emily in Paris star may be called \"classic\" or \"glamorous,\" but the actor rarely ventures into the unconventional. And you could argue the same thing about luxury brand Cartier. But apparently, when the two get together, the trendy, off-beat coolness comes out — a Collins\\'s hair is proof.In the new ad campaign for Clash de Cartier, a jewelry collection that strikes a balance between classic and eccentric, Collins does exactly that. We see her in an elegant, asymmetrical black dress and red lipstick, and her brown hair is pulled back into a sleek, low bun, not unlike the style she wore for her wedding — basically exactly how we picture Lily Collins when we picture Lilly Collins.As Billy Idol\\'s \"Dancing With Myself\" plays, she stands in contrast with another version of herself that looks completely out of her beauty comfort zone, yet it somehow works so well.

Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.On Tuesday, Collins teased a preview of the look, giving us a peek at the baby bangs, which appear to have been styled by Gregory Russell. The makeup looks were done by Fiona Stiles, and the manicures by nail artist Thuy Nguyen.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Although Collins recently told us that her curtain bangs are a \"dedicated decision\" that she\\'s wanted to do \"for years but never had the courage to take the plunge,\" it looks like she may be open to trying other, unexpected fringe looks.

Her 29th birthday look has all the elements that define her signature style: inches and inches of hair, super long acrylic nails, and lots of bling.She posted a few photos of the gorgeous birthday look to Instagram on July 4, showing off her mile-long curls nearly as white as snow, pastel purple eye makeup, and baby blue nail design full of iridescent gems. She is seen in a cutout purple dress with her platinum blonde curls cascading over one of her shoulders, the ends almost grazing her knees. Though she tends to switch up her hair color often, she\\'s indulged in her blonde era many times before with this bright hue, just like when she chopped off her hair into a platinum-blonde buzz cut right at the end of 2021.The light hair color pairs beautifully with her lavender cut crease, which also complements her gown perfectly. You\\'d think the light purple shade would also make an appearance on her nails, but not at all. Instead, this stiletto manicure was painted a light blue hue, which feels like an apt choice for the water sign. Each icy blue nail was filled with opalescent jewels of various sizes running straight down the middle.

On the 2022 red carpet, it has come in the form of elaborate headpieces, an overwhelming amount of black attire for a white-tie event, and some very funky hairstyles — especially including that of Alicia Keys.Keys walked the red carpet on May 2 in a black gown, completed by a cape bedazzled with the New York City skyline (how fitting for the singer who wrote the concrete-jungle-wet-dream-tomato song). When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection. When is it not?Getty ImagesThen I caught a look at her long braid from the side and the back and now I'm bewildered by… whatever is in her hair. As you can see below, Keys's braid is — I don't even know what word to use here — woven? Woven with something I'm finding very hard to describe. It's like a black-and-silver ribbon… made out of CDs… bedazzled CDs?Getty ImagesIn short, I have no idea what is going on with this hairstyle or what to call it, but it looks damn good. Then again, Alicia Keys could've rocked up to the Met Gala in a garbage can and she still would've made it look soulfully chic. It's what she does best.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King's Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNeed more?

On the 2022 red carpet, it has come in the form of elaborate headpieces, an overwhelming amount of black attire for a white-tie event, and some very funky hairstyles — especially including that of Alicia Keys.Keys walked the red carpet on May 2 in a black gown, completed by a cape bedazzled with the New York City skyline (how fitting for the singer who wrote the concrete-jungle-wet-dream-tomato song). When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection. When is it not?Getty ImagesThen I caught a look at her long braid from the side and the back and now I'm bewildered by… whatever is in her hair. As you can see below, Keys's braid is — I don't even know what word to use here — woven? Woven with something I'm finding very hard to describe. It's like a black-and-silver ribbon… made out of CDs… bedazzled CDs?Getty ImagesIn short, I have no idea what is going on with this hairstyle or what to call it, but it looks damn good. Then again, Alicia Keys could've rocked up to the Met Gala in a garbage can and she still would've made it look soulfully chic. It's what she does best.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King's Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNeed more?

But, what if I told you there\\'s another radiance-intensifying ingredient that\\'s also a staple in your jewelry box? That\\'s right, I\\'m talking about gold, which is one of the many luminosity-amplifying ingredients in 111Skin\\'s Rose Gold Radiance Booster.111Skin is no stranger to luxury beauty: the brand has started gaining some serious hype from celebs like Kesha and it\\'s become a repeat feature in the Allure Beauty Box for its impressive, skin-nourishing formulations. Even our very own associate features director Dianna Mazzone is a fan of the brand, particularly 111Skin\\'s Vitamin C Brightening Booster. So, I already knew I was in good hands when this fancy-schmancy rose gold bottle first landed on my desk.Courtesy of brandImmediately, I did a quick scan of the label to see if my sensitive, rosacea-stricken skin could handle the formula. The serum contains a few ingredients that are already in my skin-care regimen: hydrating hyaluronic acid, brightening niacinamide, and soothing rosewater. \"The best known effect of rosewater is being anti-inflammatory, which can reduce redness and swelling in the skin,\" Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist James Wang, MD, says of the latter ingredient. \"The hydrating and antibacterial benefits, combined with its ability to calm the skin, can be especially helpful in some patients with inflammatory acne and rosacea.\"But what made me raise my eyebrows in skepticism was the pure gold extract. This may seem like a gimmicky ingredient, but Dr. Wang says that this precious metal can actually have a purpose in your skin-care routine. He notes that gold actually is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and claims of targeting fine lines and wrinkles. \"Although not a fully proven effect, gold is thought to help with wrinkles and signs of sun damage by also boosting collagen production,\" he says. With all of this in mind, Dr. Wang says this ingredient can be irritating to sensitive skin or those allergic to gold, so always patch test this product before applying it to your face.According to the bottle\\'s directions, there are two ways you can use this product: alone after cleansing or mixed into your favorite moisturizer. Whichever path you choose, the brand recommends using one to two drops. I decided to try both avenues of application simply out of curiosity and I\\'ve found that its slippery formula absorbs equally as well, regardless of how you apply it.As for its texture, the Rose Gold Radiance Booster is shimmery and has a slippery feel to it, almost like a champagne-hued version of a snail mucin serum. Once I applied it to my skin, the first thing I noticed was how teensy the gold particles were, which didn\\'t irritate my skin at all. It left a reflective veil of natural-looking shimmer without looking too intense or dramatic, and because of this, I\\'ve been reserving this sparkly serum for my morning skin-care regimen.Jennifer Hussein for AllureSo, is this gold-infused serum really worth the triple-digit price tag? Considering the fact that I\\'ve been using it daily for two months and have seen a major difference in the radiance of my complexion, my answer is a million times over, absolutely. Sure, there are many brightening skin-care products on the market, but as someone who\\'s tested hundreds of these formulations, 111Skin\\'s iridescent serum provided significant results that I haven\\'t achieved with other picks. And, at the very least, it\\'s literally liquid gold for your face, so why not treat yourself to a little luxury?111Skin Rose Gold Radiance Booster$135Want to try it for yourself?

Each design I create is a reflection of who I am.\"Short Nail Art InspirationGrowing up in Texas with family from Mexico City, Goldstein has had a wide variety of influences on her nail designs, the biggest of which was museum art. She developed an appreciation of the techniques of Diego Rivera, the Mexican painter who became Frida Kahlo\\'s husband, the color palette combinations of Josef Albers, the German artist who was the first to get solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art and the Met in New York, and the styles of her grandparents\\' house in Mexico City, which was designed by Architect Luis Barragán.\"I believe Barragán\\'s work is a study of the language of the colors of México,\" she says. \"Being surrounded by a wide palette definitely shaped my understanding of the interplay between colors and how colors affect emotions, which has impacted my designs greatly.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.When it comes to creating designs now, Goldstein uses her own style and life as inspiration. Because she uses her hands for work —through manicures and jewelry design (did we mention she owns two brands, Doublemoss Jewelry and Doublemoss Arte?) —she found that short nails are the most functional.How to Shape Short NailsGoldstein explains that shaping has the biggest impact on creating the illusion of longer nails. She\\'s a big fan of the tapered oval and square shapes but recommends avoiding flat square nails because they can make your nails look shorter. In terms of trends, every design can look good on short nails, Goldstein says, citing French tips and negative space nails as examples, but it\\'s the way the design is styled that matters.\"If you do a thick, flat French tip, it makes your short nail look shorter,\" she says, opposed to a daintier, more curved tip. \"Negative space nails work wonders for shorter nails. A clean sheer base helps minimize the attention on the nail and focus on the art.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Celebrities Who Love Short NailsWhen navigating designs with clients, Goldstein\\'s biggest goal is to make sure the nails complement the entire look, especially when doing celebrity nails for red carpet events (her résumé includes several Met Galas, U.S. press for The Batman, and The Academy of Motion Pictures Museum Opening Gala, but no big deal).Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I never want the nail art to take over,\" she says. \"Nail art is not for everyone, and I like to respect that by never pushing it on any of my clients.\"Goldstein also enjoys how collaborative the nail art process can be, naming her method with Gemma Chan, whose nails she did for the Met Gala in 2019 and 2021 and The Eternals premiere in London, as an example.\"I create a design based on what she is wearing and then consult Gemma for any tweaks or changes,\" she says. \"I love that Gemma isn\\'t scared to take risks with nails and respects the art.\"Goldstein is making major strides in bringing short nails back, and we\\'re obsessed with all of her designs. To sum it all up, we\\'d say she\\'s nailing it.

To be real, anything \"boiling over\" on our face is something we\\'d like to avoid.According to the National Eczema Association, 31.6 million people in the U.S. have some form of eczema, making it one of the most common skin conditions. If you\\'re experiencing red, irritated skin on your face (especially your eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, or chin), there\\'s a fairly good chance it\\'s facial eczema. You may already have it elsewhere on your body, or it could be on your face alone. And while there is no study evaluating the prevalence of facial eczema, specifically, New York City-based dermatologist Neil Sadick, MD, says he believes the disorder affects about a third of the population.With facial eczema, you\\'ll have to do a bit of detective work to identify what\\'s causing it. There are a few types — atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis being the two most common forms — and they act a little differently. Some types will resolve in a few weeks with treatment, while other cases are chronic and need constant management. But you\\'re not alone. There are solutions as well as ways to keep it under control.Facial eczema can be itchy, flaky, and frustrating — your face is usually the first thing people see — and with so many types of eczema to parse through, it can be overwhelming. To help, we spoke with several board-certified dermatologists to find out what exactly constitutes facial eczema, what triggers the condition, and most importantly, how to keep symptoms at bay.Meet the experts:Macrene Alexiades, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center of New York in New York City.Hadley King, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Anthony Rossi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Neil Sadick, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Adam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C.Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Read MoreBody & Mind GuideSymptoms, treatment options, and personal experiences for various physical, mental, and health conditions and concerns.ArrowIn this story:What Is Facial Eczema?Causes of Facial EczemaHow to Prevent Facial EczemaHow to Treat Facial EczemaShould I Treat Facial Eczema Differently Than I Would Eczema on My Body?What Should I Do if Over-The-Counter Products Aren\\'t Cutting It?What Is Facial Eczema?\"Eczema is an inflammation of the skin caused by either an allergen or irritant,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Anthony Rossi, MD. It can also be genetic, and triggered by irritants.Facial eczema has many different symptoms that can manifest themselves differently from person to person, but some common things to look for are red patches, itchy skin, stinging, and dryness. With darker skin tones, it also tends to be scaly, says Dr. Rossi.Eczema is a common condition that can appear anywhere on the body, but if you\\'re grappling with facial eczema, it\\'s likely on the eyelids, eyebrows, cheeks, or chin. And while it is common, you definitely should bring it to your dermatologist. \"Eczema that develops near the eyes needs special attention because the eyes themselves can be affected,\" adds Dr. Alexiades. \"Those with eczema around the eyes are more susceptible to certain eye problems such as conjunctivitis, inflamed cornea, and changes in the shape of the cornea, a condition called keratoconus.\"Causes of Facial EczemaThere are a few different types of facial eczema — which will be key in not just identifying what you\\'re dealing with, but how you treat it. The most common type of facial eczema is atopic dermatitis. \"Atopic dermatitis is genetic and flares can be triggered by dry environmental conditions, not moisturizing, stress, and allergies,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Hadley King, MD.The second type is contact dermatitis, which comes from exposure to an irritating substance or something you may be allergic to (common perpetrators are cosmetics, dyes, soaps, detergents, fragrance, or smoke — in addition to environmental allergens like pet dander or pollen). \"Some people break out in an eczema rash after eating certain foods, such as nuts, shellfish, milk, and eggs,\" says Dr. Alexiades.Try to note when you see an eczema flare and note any common denominators to your dermatologist. This should help both you and your dermatologist narrow it down and get to the root cause.How to Prevent Facial EczemaThe best way to prevent eczema on the face is the most obvious but perhaps the most important method: identify the trigger and remove it. \"For example, if you notice red patches when you wear jewelry, you may be allergic to nickel. Stop wearing jewelry and your eczema may go away,\" says Dr. Alexiades. \"If you notice red itchy patches after a night out, it may be perfume that is your trigger, in which case stop wearing fragrances and look for fragrance-free cosmetics.\"The same goes for cosmetics and skincare. \"Know what’s in your skincare and if you’re prone to allergies,\" says Dr. Rossi. It may be beneficial to go on a \"product diet.\" Pare down your routine to one gentle product (a cleanser is a good place to start) and add them back in slowly, one by one, to see if you can identify which product is causing your facial eczema. Patch testing—applying a small amount of a product to the sensitive skin on the inside of the arm to see if there is a reaction within 24 hours—can also help to narrow things down.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf you find that your flare-ups happen when you\\'re stressed, you may need to identify some lifestyle changes like taking on fewer projects, getting more rest, or finding more time for mindfulness. Likewise, if you notice that your facial eczema gets worse in dry or hot weather, try to plan ahead for AC breaks, come prepared with sunscreen, and find a thicker and more reliable moisturizer that can hang on all day.How to Treat Facial EczemaSometimes, simply removing your facial eczema triggers will totally cure your skin within weeks. But if your facial eczema is very severe and you can\\'t identify any bad actors, you may want to try over-the-counter hydrocortisone or get a topical steroid prescription from your dermatologist. \"A topical corticosteroid cream will help treat any of the causes of facial eczema,\" says Dr. King. “Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects.” They can be used as needed to treat flares but not for ongoing maintenance, according to the National Eczema Association, since prolonged use can cause withdrawal side effects like red, irritated skin and pimple-like papules.Dr. Rossi adds that antihistamines can be an effective short-term solution if the eczema is caused by an allergen. Otherwise, \"there are more systemic medications for severe or widespread cases,\" he says.How to Curb Flare-upsNot all types of eczema have a surefire \"cure,\" but you can definitely make it more manageable and lessen your flare-ups. You may be able to curb irritation with good lifestyle habits, over-the-counter products, and consistent skincare with gentle but moisturizing products.\"Good, gentle care of your skin is the most important aspect of treating facial eczema,\" says Dr. Alexiades, who recommends fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products if you find that you’re prone to flare-ups. \"Consider a mild cleanser and wash your face with lukewarm water, since heat can cause a flare-up.\"Dr. Alexiades also touts the benefits of keeping your skin hydrated. She recommends moisturizers with emollient ingredients like ceramides and cosmetics that also have moisturizing ingredients. \"Having facial eczema doesn’t mean you can never wear makeup, but not all products are the same,\" she says. \"Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and shea butter.\" Moisturizers and cosmetics with moisturizing ingredients (like hyaluronic acid and shea butter) can help to protect the outer skin barrier—which can be damaged or compromised by eczema, according to the National Eczema Association.Should I treat facial eczema differently than I would eczema on my body?Yes. Both Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, and Dr. Sadick recommend using milder products on your face because the skin is thinner and more sensitive than the skin on your body. \"I would use eczema skin-care products designed for face and body respectively as they contain different concentrations of active ingredients,\" says Dr. Sadick.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesAdam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., recommends using weaker topical steroids, as he says, \"facial skin is more sensitive to the skin thinning and lightening effect of topical steroids.\" According to a study by the National Eczema Association, prolonged use of strong topical steroids can cause a host of withdrawal symptoms once you stop using the cream—like burning, stinging, papules, or pimple-like bumps. However, short-term use is safe and effective with the guidance of a dermatologist.What should I do if over-the-counter products aren\\'t cutting it?Sadly, sometimes eczema on the face can prove extremely stubborn to the point where treatment may need to be prescribed by a doctor. \"If home treatments are not helping, you may need prescription medications,\" says Dr. Shah. \"I usually prescribe either a topical steroid or a topical calcineurin inhibitor, a non-steroidal medication that can reduce inflammation and treat eczema.\"Dr. Shah says she sometimes prescribes special moisturizers called barrier repair creams for patients. And if the eczema is severe and not responding to topical treatments, other options include phototherapy, aka light therapy. There\\'s a wide range of treatment options for facial eczema, so it often comes down to trial and error in order to figure out what works for you. We\\'d recommend always consulting your dermatologist before trying anything new.Read more about caring for skin conditions:6 Skin-Care Ingredients to Add to Your Routine If You Have EczemaHow to Treat Scalp Eczema, According to DermatologistsWhy Colloidal Oatmeal Should Be Part of Your Skin-Care RegimenYou can follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on all things beauty.', 'The 2022 Met Gala is here and back on the first Monday of May. This year, celebrities were challenged with the theme, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion,\" with an emphasis on gilded glamour. Tonight, stars are showing how they\\'re channeling the essence of the Gilded Age with black gowns, lengthy nails, and extravagant headpieces.The vintage waves and slicked-back chignons may be nice, but headpieces are the star of the show at this year\\'s version of the fashion event — and rightfully so. Simple headwear like bedazzled tiaras and golden headbands made their appearance alongside elaborate fascinators and massive hats. It\\'s clear that head coverings are key to the gilded glamour theme, and here are some of our favorite ones.Flaming DiscsGetty ImagesLa La Anthony arrived earlier in the night in a burgundy two-piece with a swirly manicure and a large red headpiece that captured our attention. On one side, there\\'s a large circular piece with red ovular pieces woven together. But, on the other side, the headpiece looks completely different — large and small candy apple-red roses shine, bringing this all-over red ensemble together.Hint of PinkGetty ImagesSarah Jessica Parker took our breaths away and clearly understood the gilded glamour assignment with her black-and-white Christopher John Roberts gown and detailed fascinator. This black netted piece covers part of her face, but it gets even better as your eyes travel up. Rolled pieces of black mesh pop out at the top alongside numerous strings with tiny diamond pieces in black and white. The fuchsia flower and leaves add a touch of color to this look that just makes sense.Abstract HaloGetty ImagesWinnie Harlow stepped on the carpet in a short abstract white dress topped with an intricate white-and-golden headpiece that we can\\'t quite describe. There\\'s thin golden rods that flow from the back of her head connecting to the clear-and-white, sharp abstract pieces that curl out from the sides of her head. This piece almost reminds us of the legs of an insect.Covered in SilverGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThis is far from the first headpiece Janelle Monáe has worn on the red carpet, and it won\\'t be the last one we ooooh and ahhhh over. The black-and-silver, striped hood connects to her bedazzled gown, which is the same color, and covers her entire head. It\\'s the epitome of glamour and excellence.Tiny TiarasGetty ImagesEmma Chamberlain was in the salon for hours the day before the Met Gala to achieve this light platinum blonde hair. Her blunt bob was parted down the middle and tucked behind her ears with a silver bedazzled tiara. This tiara isn\\'t in-your-face, but the delicate piece matches her studded accessories well.Pieces of GoldGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesTommy Dorfman made a statement with her hunter green, latex dress with black leather gloves. The small golden headband on her head complements the gold pieces on her cut-out dress. Tiny squarish shapes are all over the top of the headband.Birds of a Feather Getty ImagesQuannah Chasinghorse always brings her culture wherever she goes. For the Met Gala, she paired a large feather headpiece with a voluminous, baby blue tulle dress. The feathers were attached to intricate braids on one side of her head and look stunning with her jewelry.Bathed in WhiteGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesCynthia Erivo\\'s towering white headwrap references the Tignon Laws, which was a law in the late 1800s that forced Black women to cover their hair. The white wrap is also an ode to the many types of headwraps Black women wear around the globe. We\\'re loving the height and volume of this chalk-white headpiece.Wide BrimsGetty ImagesSZA was clearly embracing the saying \"go big or go home,\" with her hot pink gown, a massive black hat, and latex gloves and thigh-high boots. The sheer size of this hat was impressive, and we would love to know if it stayed put the whole night or if she had to take it off to avoid accidentally hitting someone. At the back of the hat is a fuzzy boa that reached below the singer\\'s waist.Sequins GaloreGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSequins and gems had a huge moment at the 2022 Met Gala. Jessica Chastain decided to shine in a long-sleeve, garnet gown with a silver snake that wrapped around the dress. She paired the look with a turban headband in the same red sequins as the dress for a matchy-matchy moment. The hair accessory also has a silver element with a jeweled brooch at the very center of her head — it\\'s lavish, glitzy, and flashy, which is apt for the glamourous theme.Netted VisionGetty ImagesClaire Danes\\'s slicked-back bob was accessorized with a black fascinator that covered most of her face and ears. This netted design was on the simpler side and almost looked like a bunch of small soda plastic rings woven together.One KnotGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesLily Aldridge is another celebrity who matched her entire outfit from head to toe. Her gown, gloves, and headscarf all had the same silver-studded black design. The bejeweled scarf was tied simply right below her neck for a chic but simple look.Golden GloryGetty ImagesNatasha Poonawalla did not skimp out on any gold on the red carpet. Her brown gown was covered in sequins and accessorized with several large gold pieces of jewelry. She even added a golden headband full of multicolored jewels in different sizes. But the main attraction was the golden corset-like piece that extends into a large headpiece. Three thin metal pieces formed a trio of circles around her head and neck, covering a portion of her face. Shorter pieces of gold curl outward on the rings matched the swirly metal on her chest area.With a TiltGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNormani arrived in a velvet black two-piece set with a brand new hair color.

On June 15, the icon announced that her seventh album, titled Renaissance, is dropping on July 29. Even though she alerted her fans of the upcoming music a month in advance — a striking difference from when she released her self-titled album in 2013 without any promotion — she still made sure to keep us on our toes by sharing the exciting news in the middle of the night and appearing on the July cover of British Vogue just a few hours later.This cover is nothing short of magnificent — and the Beyhive agrees. The \"Spirit\" singer looks like royalty sitting on top of a horse in an all-black Maison Alaia gown with a massive feather headpiece. The rest of the photo shoot is just as breathtaking and extravagant. In one image, she appears in another black outfit but with a leather jacket, black box braids that hairstylist Jawara twisted into what looks like Bantu knots, and a glossy black lip, painted by her longtime makeup artist, Sir John. She looks like the baddest person to ever live sitting on top of a motorcycle instead of a horse.The hair and headpieces were clearly a focal priority in this shoot. They are striking, futuristic, and risky. In a few photos, she has dark hair instead of her usual blonde-highlighted strands, which is making some fans wonder if Queen Bey will be returning to her brunette era for this new album.Getty ImagesBut there is one other hairstyle that is sparking some strong reactions from the Beyhive. The hairstyle in question is the choppy baby fringe she wears with a gilded Schiaparelli Haute Couture outfit and jewelry. These short bangs are far from Beyonce\\'s norm and took several Twitter fans back to 2014, one of the few other times we have seen her with baby bangs.If you don\\'t remember that fringe, let me jog your memory for a second — they were thick, very blunt, and super short, stopping several inches about her forehead. She wore similar bangs in her \\'60s-inspired music video for \"Why Don\\'t You Love Me,\" which was released four years prior. She also had a pair of those stubby bangs in a brunette shade in her \"Telephone\" music video with pop star Lady Gaga.screenshot of Beyoncé from “Telephone” video\\nCourtesy of UMG/InterscopeA few fans noted how the resurgence of these bangs indicated that the Houston singer\\'s upcoming music is about to be epic.One user tweeted side-by-side photos of the spiky bangs and her baby fringe from 2014 and, \"Beyoncé is NOT playing she brought the choppy bangs out.\" Another fan compared the two photos and commented, \"Beyoncé even resurrected the chopped and screwed bangs.

Another jokingly noted that the fringe was probably styled by one of her five-year-old twins. \"I love that Beyoncé always includes her kids in her work, the fact that she got rumi and sir to cut her bangs/style her hair,\" the tweet reads.Regardless of your feelings about the baby fringe, we\\'re sure you\\'re more than excited for the upcoming album — we definitely are. Some fans are thinking it\\'s going to include disco and house influences due to rumors about artists she is collaborating with and the overall vibe of the shoot; it blends retro elements, such as a giant disco ball and platform boots, and futuristic designs. We won\\'t fully know until July 29, but we\\'re sure that Beyoncé will deliver hits as she always has.Read more stories about bangs:21 Types of Bangs to Consider If You\\'re Ready to Take the PlungeBottleneck Bangs Are the New, Daintier Take on Curtain BangsYour Guide to Styling, Maintaining, and Growing Out Curtain BangsNow enjoy this pro-dancers entire daily routine:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'In our humble opinion, nothing beats the rush of getting a needle poked through your skin for a piercing. Among the various ways to express yourself through body modification, they\\'re relatively low risk and just plain ol\\' fun.Piercing trends tend to ebb and flow. Some locations, like the ear lobe, seemingly never go out of style while other placements, like the belly button, resurge in popularity every few years or so. The COVID-19 pandemic affected many folks\\' ability to get piercings as mask-covered areas became off-limits. But, as tattoo and piercing shops open back up, more people have been willing to experiment, whether it\\'s by adding new jewelry to old holes or getting something entirely new.We chatted with a few piercers to learn about all the ear and body piercing trends you should expect in the new year. Here are the piercing trends you\\'ll be seeing everywhere in 2022.Ear CurationsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyThe ear is a popular site for piercings, but recently more folks are seeking out ear curations, according to piercer Amber Maysonet who works at Live by the Sword Tattoo. \"It\\'s basically a mapping and planning for either now or future piercings for your ears,\" she explains. Ear curations involve giving the piercer the creative freedom to choose multiple piercings for you while taking into account your aesthetic and your ear\\'s anatomy to figure out the best placements and jewelry. Sometimes these curations also involve adding new jewelry to already existing piercings to ensure everything works together.Maysonet cites social media, especially TikTok, as the reason why she thinks more people are choosing these curations. \"When you look at [these piercings], especially on social media, you see how good everything goes together and how nice [they] look on somebody else, obviously you\\'re like, \\'OMG, I can do that,\\'\" she shares.At Brooklyn\\'s So Gold Studies, piercer and founder Cassi Lopez-March requires that clients have at least three existing piercings and be willing to get one to three additional piercings during an ear curation session. She finds that more of her clients are seeking out \"full-blown ear styling\" rather than coming in with pre-determined placements because the average person does not always know what they want. \"When someone gives us free reign to kind of have fun with it, that\\'s when the magic happens,\" she shares.OrbitalsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyIf you google \"orbital piercing,\" you\\'ll see a couple of different piercing locations, but don\\'t let the internet confuse you, Cassi Lopez-March says. \"An actual orbital is just one ring that connects two holes,\" she explains. You can get two new piercings or use new jewelry to connect older ones. She has noticed this placement becoming extremely popular with clients who want to refresh their old holes and give them a new life. At her shop, they tend to add orbitals to the lobe area to connect second or even third piercings.NavalCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2017, I fulfilled one of my childhood dreams of getting a belly button piercing. I remember a friend of mine was a bit shocked that I chose the location given that it was no longer \"popular.\" But it looks like I may have been ahead of the curve (and honestly, I don\\'t make my decisions on trends alone) because both Maysonet and Lopez-March see a resurgence in belly rings coming soon.Just like fashion and beauty trends, nostalgia is winning once again with piercings, seeing as belly rings had their last heyday in the 2000s. But Maysonet has seen folks adding a bit of a twist to the placement by getting both the top and bottom of their bellies pierced rather than choosing just one or the other.Flat HelixCourtesy of Instagram/@studsFolks are becoming more interested in receiving multiple piercings at once rather than just one. \"Right now, I think the piercing trends of 2022 are being influenced by the excitement and relief of returning to travel, celebrations, and concerts with new trends of bold self-expression,\" Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of piercing studio Studs where they focus exclusively on ear piercings, shares. That\\'s why she predicts that a trio of piercings on the flat helix will be big in the new year.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe flat helix is specifically the flat area of cartilage located in the upper ear. Bubbers says it\\'s a great spot because you can try out a few different types of jewelry options and have fun with customization. She\\'s also noticed an increase in asymmetrical placements, which can be done in this area.EyebrowGetty ImagesRecently, we\\'ve noticed certain celebrities with new eyebrow piercings — some fake, some real. On September 27, Lil Nas X showed off his new eyebrow piercing on TikTok to fans\\' praise. (Since then we haven\\'t really seen it make another appearance, so who knows if the jewelry was just a fake-out.)Cardi B debuted her own eyebrow piercing during Paris Fashion Week in one of the best ways possible. She showed out in an extravagant red Mugler dress and cape with bedazzled red brows and a silver ring through her left eyebrow. The eyebrow was a popular piercing location in the \\'90s and 2000s, and it seems like it will be reentering the mainstream in 2022.Snakebites/StacksCourtesy of Instagram/@ileanastabbedmeMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2019, Studs created their signature \"Snakebite\" piercing, which model Kaia Gerber helped make popular. The name may be a bit confusing if you\\'re used to the Snakebite lip piercing — which typically means two piercings spaced out at each outer corner of the lower lip — but this is an ear piercing that involves stacking two holes close together on the outer cartilage of the mid-ear area. Bubbers says they expect to see folks trying the piercing in new places like the Forward Helix and Conch in 2022.The jewelry in these holes is just as important as the piercings themselves. Scrolling through Studs\\'s Instagram, you\\'ll see ears full of these Snakebite piercings with gold and silver jewelry in all shapes and sizes.NosesCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMaysonet has also seen an increase in nose piercings, both on the nostril and the septum. She cites the resurgence of punk, alternative, and even scene aesthetics as the impetus for this rise. We\\'re also willing to bet that once mask mandates are lifted in certain areas that it will allow more people to finally try the piercing placement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesYou can get a simple septum or nostril piercing or go all out and try two piercings, whether that be with one hole in each nostril, two holes in one nostril, or a septum and nostril piercing. It\\'s up to you to decide what kind of fun you\\'re into.With the unpredictability of the past two years, there\\'s truly no knowing what will happen in the piercing world. But we are sure that more and more folks will continue to dip into creativity and give their piercer freedom to guide them along their piercing journey.Read more stories about body modification:Contraconch Piercings Are Gaining Popularity For Their Unexpected PlacementYour Complete Guide to Vulva PiercingsHow Your Belly Button Piercing Changes When You Get PregnantNow watch 100 years of piercings:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'It almost felt like the MTV VMAs were back to their pre-pandemic form tonight at the 2022 show. Nicki Minaj, LL Cool J, and Jack Harlow hosted and kept us entertained throughout the music-filled night. Minaj was even awarded the 2022 VMA Video Vanguard award, both exciting and well deserved. In addition to these three celebs, Lizzo, Bad Bunny, and Anitta all blessed the stage with their voices.The performances were amazing, and our eyes were zoned in on what these stars were wearing from head to toe, both on and off the stage. They were already wowing us with their massive feather headpieces, face jewelry, and slicked-back hair, but we were also obsessing over all the manicures. Here are just a few that we are loving.Dove CameronGetty ImagesDove Cameron went for dark grunge vibes at the awards show. She paired her strapless leather and floral gown with smoked-out burgundy eye makeup, plum glossy lips, and stiletto-shaped nails.

For example, there were deep red rose charms and silver gems on each middle finger. If you look closely, you might have noticed the black scissor decals on each ring fingernail.Betty WhoGetty ImagesThe Australian-born singer-songwriter showed up with black-and-white graphic nails. Each hand had different nail designs. On one hand, there were various sizes of white and black stars on each nail. The other hand had white hearts on the index and ring fingers. The white design on the middle finger was actually an ode to the awards show; it\\'s the iconic MTV logo.Monét X ChangeGetty ImagesMonét X Change had already caught over eyes with her large afro puffs and bright tropical-inspired makeup, but we made sure not to forget her white swirly tips.

Her bedazzled metallic nails practically blend into her dress in the above photo. The medium-length, almond-shaped nails were full of sparkly gems and jewels.Lil Nas XGetty ImagesNow, hearing the words \"goth Big Bird\" probably sounds like the strangest and worst thing in the world, but we swear Lil Nas X\\'s VMAs outfit will make you rethink that. The rapper showed out with a massive black feather headpiece with matching pants. It\\'s hard to take your eyes off this elaborate feather piece, but the mismatched manicure he wore that night also deserves some fanfare.OPI Nail Lacquer in Bubble Bath$11OPI Nail Lacquer in Black Onyx$11Two nails on each hand were painted completely black by nail artist Temeka Jackson who used OPI GelColor polishes, which are exclusively available to nail artists, to complete this look. Thankfully, the two shades she used, Bubble Bath (pale pink) and Black Onyx (pitch black), are available in nail lacquer form, so this look can be recreated at home. With the Black Onyx polish and a thin brush, she drew French tips, geometric shapes, and lines to create the nail art.Becky GGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesBecky G looked gorgeous in a sequined gown that looked just like a stained glass window.

The different clips stitched together show the model in a pink velvet bathing suit (ah, a true sign of an L.A. winter) with frosty pink eye makeup and matching pink butterfly clips pulling her hair back from her face.\"Todays vibe,\" the nonchalant caption reads, along with a couple of emojis. Throughout the video, Bieber smiles and makes duck faces while she shows off her look. Her hair is middle-parted and styled with natural beach waves and baby braids. As for makeup, she\\'s opted for layered pink eye shadow: a lighter shade on her inner lids, and a darker hue on her outer lids. Pink glitter serves as her eyeliner, which rims both lash lines and extends outward into a baby wing. The monochromatic look also features a rosy blush, a pink lip color, and soft highlighter on her cheek bones. We\\'re taking notes, and plan on channeling this look all spring long.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.For her nails, she\\'s staying on-trend with a classic French oval manicure so simple that it doesn\\'t take away from her finger tattoos.

She\\'s wearing a few necklaces, including mixed and matched pearls with a custom letter bead necklace (although we can\\'t read what it spells out), two belly chains, and gold hoop earrings.We love all of Hailey\\'s content (shout-out to her skin-care tips, pictures with Justin, and TikTok dances), but we can\\'t get enough of her glowing beauty looks, either.

And while it's all too common for some to slouch when it comes to following the theme of the night, one guest nailed it in the gilded glamor department at the 2022 Met Gala. Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers. It was shiny gold and covered in ruby and pearl-looking appliqués. She also sported a gold, armor-esque covering on her other pointer finger. The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore. Somehow, it was both a retro and futuristic look all at once. And one that set the hearts of internet critics aflame.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.King kept the rest of her beauty look simple, with cropped hair and minimal-looking makeup. Because why take attention away from the nail situation?

If that wasn\\'t enough, the \"Kiss Me More\" singer made our jaws drop with the stunning Schiaparelli black gown and gold accessories she wore for the awards show. By now we expect the pop star to capture our attention with every new look, but we didn\\'t expect her to show up to the event with short nails or intricate gold rings that look like they\\'re worth more than my student loans.The \"Say So\" singer didn\\'t hesitate to take risks for this look, something we love from her. Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas gave her a neutral smokey eye with a hint of bright yellow on the inner crease and waterline that complemented the daring gown very well. As for her hair, hairstylist Jared Henderson (known as JStay Ready to many) slicked her dark hair into a high ponytail with a flipped end that we have a good feeling was fun to whip around.Getty ImagesTypically Doja Cat wears lengthy nails, but for this look, she kept them short. Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe. But this manicure is anything but simple, because this opulent jewelry is basically nail art.Her middle finger had the largest ring, which covered her entire finger and nail. The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own. The other two rings were simpler, which is saying something.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one!

The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me.

One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade. As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says.

As early cosmetic pioneers, the Egyptians are often credited with creating some of history’s first grills, but this an archeological misconception: two teeth found bound together with gold from 2,500 BC-era Giza probably weren\\'t fashioned together as a mouthpiece, but a pendant worn by somebody with poor dental hygiene. A form of tooth jewelry indeed, if a less currently fashionable one.Some more iconic grills in history: Grace Jones\\' fronts on a 1975 cover of Vogue Hommes; the Boliano skull, of a presumed nobleman found in Pangasinan, Philippines, with its full set of gold teeth etched to resemble fish fins; Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me; the diamond lower Justin Bieber wore to marry to Hailey Baldwin in 2019. A grill can be a statement. Unless it\\'s a question, as in rapper A$AP Rocky\\'s 2022 video for D.M.B., co-starring the mother of his child, Rihanna. Rocky smiles, and his grill asks \"Marry me?\" in gold. Rihanna smiles and reveals her answer, in matching font: \"I do.\"In the late \\'70s, jewelry began twinkling in more and more mouths in New York City, often those of West Indian immigrants. The \\'80s saw the opening of Famous Eddie\\'s Gold Teeth, whereEddie Plein crafted custom grills for rappers Kool G Rap, Just-Ice, and Flavor Flav. The most expensive grill on record was created under different musical circumstances. Bill Dorfman, cosmetic dentist and author of Billion Dollar Smile, helped mint a million dollar piece for Katy Perry; a floral motif in purple, blue, and white diamonds gleams out from Perry\\'s Dark Horse music video in something like a snarl — the size of the stones prohibits mouth closure.The smile decor of the moment is pared-back metalwork, colorful stones, and a royal air — mingled with tradition. If Plein peddles in gold, Johnny Dang of Houston trades almost exclusively in diamonds — Dang met the rapper Paul Wall working in his family\\'s jewelry repair shop and the two went into the lucrative business of chandelier-style mouthpieces. In New York, Helen Harris, or @helenwiththegoldteeth, corners the model market, with sculptural, often understated caps and sets.Ahead, three models with their own signature, bedazzled smiles share the stories behind their dental accessories.Chloé VéroTo create a similar makeup look: Eye Shadow in Mint Condition and Lipglass in Spite by MAC.\\nBorn in Queens, Véro moved to South Florida at 10 and yearned to return to her birthplace. She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says.

Yep, it\\'s equally as disappointing when you find an eye-catching set of earrings only to find it\\'s made of materials that could irritate your skin. Sure, they say pain is beauty, but when that pain involves itchiness, redness, and uncomfortable rashes (on an already-thin and sensitive part of your skin, no less), it begs the question: \"were these hoops really worth it?\" The short answer is, well, no.And remember: you\\'ll know if your piercing is infected if it\\'s red, inflamed, sore, hot to touch, or if it\\'s releasing puss. You should consult with your physician if you suspect you have an infection.The truth is, if you\\'re someone who struggles with finding earrings that won\\'t cause discomfort, you may have to work a little harder to find your match. \"Unfortunately, sterling silver jewelry is made with a mix of metals, often nickel, which is the most significant irritant to sensitive ears,\" explains Ottawa-based medical director of Concept Medical Samuel Hetz, MD. \"Those with sensitive ears want to find hypoallergenic rhodium-plated jewelry with low to no nickel content.\" He recommends looking for the standard benchmarks of 14k gold or above as well as sterling silver 925 grade to reduce the chances of nickel content.Because we don\\'t believe those with sensitive skin should be left out of the party, we rounded up nine of the best earrings for sensitive ears that are always stylish, and never irritating.BaubleBar Sutara 18K Gold Earrings$48 at BaubleBar$42 at NordstromFor sensitive-skinned folks, Baublebar\\'s Sutara Earrings will make you thank your lucky stars they\\'re made out of 18k gold.

All around me were people filling in or touching up their ink, but I continued onward past the buzzing needles — straight to the back, where the piercer works. After a tough year, I was ready for a bit of body modification to memorialize the challenges and symbolize the jump forward into 2022. What I didn\\'t realize, as I asked for a third lobe piercing to continue to build my stack of hoops, is that my bright idea was of a pace with a wide new piercing trend.More and more customers are asking for what Alaina Rothstein, cofounder of Los Angeles ear piercing service Leo West, refers to as a \"milestone piercing.\" Rothstein has seen mothers and daughters come in for birthday piercing; she knows of a woman who miscarried and got a stud to remind her of the loss. \"It\\'s a fun, really beautiful way to carry something special with you in happy times and in sad times,\" she says. \"And I think it\\'s like super cool that it\\'s translated [from the tattoo world] into the piercing world.\"Our piercers have seen birthdays, bachelorette parties, and groups of friends come in to celebrate together. But what trends are they trying, specifically? In other words, which parts of the ear are getting the most adoration through adornment right now?Meet the experts:Alaina Rothstein and Jill Katz, RN, cofounders of Los Angeles ear-piercing service Leo WestLisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a piercing studio with locations in New York, Texas, and California (among others)Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer at Live by the Sword Tattoo in Brooklyn, New YorkIn This Story:Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?How to Pick Your PiercerConstellation PiercingsStacked LobesVertical StacksForward HelixSnakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)ConchOuter Conch, a.k.a. SconchJump ahead, or read on for everything you need to know about the freshest ear-piercing trends, as well as the estimated length of time the healing process may take.Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?Milestones are one reason customers are flocking to their local licensed piercer, but another is a generalized sense of freedom and autonomy that\\'s arrived as a result of the pandemic. \"With remote work and workplace norms overall changing, more people are feeling free to experiment with bolder looks and express their personality,\" says Lisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a national piercing studio. That experimentation shows up both in the amount of piercings and in the piercings themselves, which are getting \"more creative,\" Bubbers says. (Plus, as Rothstein points out, \"one fun thing about mask-wearing is that your ears show.\")The last \"really important trend,\" as Leo West cofounder Jill Katz, RN describes it, is \"adorning what you got.\" There\\'s no normal, she says. A gorgeous earscape is all about working with your budget and your anatomy to create an embodiment of your style in tiny, beautiful silver, gold, or gem form.The result: forward helices, vertically stacked lobes, conches, sconches, snake bites, and plenty of other piercing types we never knew existed, spanning from the outer rims of the ear to the inner cartilage and back to the earlobe. Our trend-spotting piercers shared the adornments they\\'ve seen grow more popular over 2022, and what they envision for the years (and ears!) to come.How to Pick Your PiercerJust as with microblading, filler, or any other body modification, it\\'s important to find a professional piercer that you trust, with a style that appeals to you. This is an essential step, whether you’re a longtime body modification fan or it’s your first piercing ever.As Brooks notes, the benefit of following a piercer on social media is that you can seek them out and, as in one service she offers, put your ear(s) in her hands. During a \"curation\" appointment, the expert will look at your ear as a whole and help design multiple piercings to fit your style and your desires.At Leo West, that might look like getting multiple differentiated piercings on each ear. \"Symmetry is out,\" says Rothstein. As she points out, a specialist is extra helpful if you\\'re nervous about curating an asymmetrical look. \"It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t want ears that match, but it has to have a rhyme or reason to it,\" she says. \"I have two ears, and I like to say ‘one’s a little bit classy, one\\'s a little bit sassy.\\'\"Constellation PiercingsInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhile some of this year\\'s trends include holes in unexpected places, more of them involve third, fourth, or fifth additions to an already-pierced ear. At Leo West, the result is what they\\'ve named a \"constellation.\" A constellation consists of \"really small pieces, close together, closer than what your traditional spacing would be,\" explains Rothstein. The result is an \"intentionally random\" grouping of ear piercings that show off studs and gems.Stacked LobesInstagram user @leowestco\"People often come in [to the studio] and say \\'I’m not cool enough,\\'\" for a trendy piercing, recounts Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer in Brooklyn. If you\\'re intimidated by the thought of a conch piercing or even a constellation, Brooks thinks that an ear stack is an easier entry point. These piercings are less painful than their cartilage-filled brethren, and can make their way up the lobe either evenly spaced or placed close together.Vertical StacksInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"If I\\'m being honest, I love to put my hair behind my ear to show the little pops of pieces sitting right above your classic [piercing],\" laughs Rothstein. She\\'s referring to a vertical stack, which entails a piercing centered directly above your traditional first or second hole. It\\'s usually filled with a small stone or a small star, Rothstein\\'s favorite. This piercing does require a certain amount of space on the lobe, but if you have enough canvas to play with, it \"gives the ear a little extra uniqueness.\"Forward Helixcourtesy of StudsThe official name for that bouncy piece of cartilage where your ear meets your skull is the \"forward helix.\" According to Bubbers, customers are coming in requesting one or even multiple piercings on the forward helix. \"We do see new and different piercing trends emerge each year based on what’s trending in fashion, culture, and celebrity,\" she says. Celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Chantal Jeffries have helped popularize the new (and finicky — helix piercings can take up to nine months to heal) style.Snakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)In the realm of body piercing, the term \"snakebite\" typically refers to two piercings on either side of your lower lip, oftentimes barbells or studs.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen it comes to ears, however, it entails two holes placed close together, slightly separated from the rest of your ear piercings, giving the impression of that your piercer just might have used two fangs to get the job done. According to Bubbers, most customers opt for a snakebite in their “midi,\" the center point of the outer ear.ConchInstagram user @leowestcoWe\\'ve named conch piercings as of-trend for the past few years, but the cartilage piercing is still popular enough to remain on the list. It pierces through the inner-ear cartilage that makes up the back of the year. At Studs, Bubbers says customers are opting more and more for a snakebite on the conch for a doubly trendy effect.Outer Conch (Sometimes Known as a \"Sconch\")courtesy of Studs\"I hope you don\\'t use this name,\" laughs Brooks. She prefers the more medical-sounding \"outer conch,\" but the phrase \"sconch\" is catching on to describe a piercing placed at the lining ridge in the cavern space close to the center of the ear.\"It\\'s right in your eye-line when people look at you,\" she says, so it provides a way to show a bit of personality even when you\\'re on Zoom or wearing a mask. Because it\\'ll be eye-catching no matter what kind of earring(s) you have in, Brooks likes adorning an outer conch piercing with a piece of jewelry that makes a big statement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesMore on the world of piercings:How Tongue Piercings Work, From Pain Level and Placement to Aftercare and Healing TimeHow to Remove Every Type of Piercing at Home8 Types of Ear Piercings, ExplainedContraconch Ear Piercings Are Gaining Popularity for Its Unexpected PlacementIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?

That way, I have a scent memory anchored to that destination or time period for whenever I choose to relive it. My last international trip, to a prestigious wellness resort in Austria for some on-the-ground reporting, demanded a very specific choice: something compact enough to fit in my carry-on without getting tossed by TSA, calming enough to match the vibe of the Alpine oasis, and extra long-lasting so it would last through hikes, meals, and medical treatments without reapplication. Lastly, it would need to smell expensive, because my fellow wellness-seekers would expect as much — but we\\'ll get to that later.After much deliberation, I landed on a luxe new formula that had just hit my desk before my flight: the Jennifer Fisher My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil.My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil$65I was initially surprised that Jennifer Fisher, a jewelry designer beloved by her red carpet clientele and the master behind some of Jennifer Lopez\\'s favorite hoop earrings, had ventured into perfumery. That said, fragrance does feel like a sparkling accessory that amps up any outfit or beauty look, and Fisher wanted her new perfume oil to make a statement for the wearer. \"I want anyone wearing My Scent to feel confident and sexy,\" she tells Allure. “And to smell like a fresh baked cookie.\" Upon first wear, I didn\\'t flag baked goods as a top note, but I did instantly fall for the vanilla and coconut Fisher knew she wanted to include in the formula.\"The blend of vanilla and coconut brings back memories from my childhood growing up in Santa Barbara, California,\" she says. \"For years, I was combining different vanilla and coconut fragrances to try and create my own personal scent. Finding a scent that was a combination of surf wax from the beaches in my hometown, Montecito, and a fresh baked cookie is what I\\'ve always wanted.\"Australian sandalwood, pear, and Tonka bean flank the creamy hero notes, and it all comes together to smell equal parts sunny and cozy, like throwing on a cashmere sweater on a breezy summer night. Toting it around is just as effortless too: I carried the teeny-tiny rollerball in my airplane carry-on, my spa robe to and from massages and lunch, and even in my fanny pack while Nordic walking in the mountains.No, really, I took this tube everywhere with me.\\nTaylore Glynn\"I wanted to come out with something small, compact, and portable you could throw in your bag and take everywhere with you,\" says Fisher. \"A spray to me didn\\'t feel as transportable, but that doesn\\'t mean I am ruling it out for the next product. This oil was designed intentionally to be worn and carried on-the-go.\" In addition to being totable, the formula also fulfilled my need for something that would last through spa treatments and saunas.\"Coconut is a good oil carrier to round out scents,\" says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, noting that scent can last longer in oil form because it\\'s not watered down. \"Atomized scents usually contain alcohol to help spraying. Fragrance oil is the most concentrated form [you can find].\"The scent was so powerful that even my fellow resort guests noticed. In fact, I was flagged down multiple times in the dining room and in the halls to reveal what I was wearing because it smelled \"beautiful\" and \"divine.\" For important context, some of the resort guests on the premises at the time — who I can\\'t explicitly identify — included one of the most famous supermodels of our generation, an Oscar-winning actress, and an entirely different famous jewelry designer with whom I chatted about ketamine therapy. I realized that My Scent smelled flat-out expensive, which seems to be a selling point amongst perfume enthusiasts on social media. In fact, there\\'s a whole genre of #FragranceTok posts dedicated to perfumes that make you smell, well, rich. After studying these videos, there\\'s a handful of perfumes that seem to universally smell like wealth: Parfums de Marly Delina, Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Montale Paris Intense Cafe, and three different Maison Francis Kurkdjian perfumes.Courtesy of brandParfums de Marly Delina$335Courtesy of brandYves Saint Laurent Libre Eau de Parfum Spray$140 $112 at NordstromIntense Cafe Eau de Parfum$170Courtesy of brandMaison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540$325They all also happen to share one intoxicating note: vanilla, which lies at the heart of My Scent.

Well, we say it's time to take a moment to appreciate such bold choices, such as Doja Cat's quirky makeup looks from Paris Fashion week — she still has us wondering how her shirt remained white with all that gold. And we certainly can't leave out the Hadid sisters' bleached brows for their own prance down the very same runways. It's not much of a shocker, then, that Gigi Hadid went for something a bit odd and definitely bold for a recent red-carpet beauty moment. For the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards on November 7, Hadid graced the carpet with an unconventional cool gray lipstick.I'll be the first to admit that I did a double-take at first glimpse. No, it's not your typical choice where a lipstick shade is concerned, but makeup artists Patrick Ta and Akina Shimizu were able to pull off this muted-yet-fresh-faced makeup look on Hadid. Catch me zooming in on those lips that are seemingly matte and glossy at the same time. We're definitely not the only ones hoping the details will soon be dropped on what particular beauty brand this lipstick is made by. Nonetheless, this all-American color pallet is insanely cohesive.Let's also not forget the striking blonde hair color and the sleek, slicked-back bun hair stylist Laura Polko put together to bring out the jewelry on Hadid's ears and nose. My favorite part is the septum ring paired with the tartan-patterned Thom Browne attire styled by Mimi Cuttrell — it's full-on grunge. I'm honestly tempted to break out my alternative pop-rock playlist, like, now.

The supermodel went for a runway-ready vibe for both of her costumes this year, though they were extremely different in tone.For her first look, Bieber covered herself in roses to pay homage to an Yves Saint Laurent haute couture runway look from 1999, originally worn by model Laetitia Casta. In her carousel of pics, Bieber wears a top and miniskirt made of huge pink roses, enhanced by a matching pink organza ruffled train at her hips. Roses also pop up on one ankle and serve as a flower crown atop her head. The look is very The Birth of Venus but make it fashion —and floral.Bieber let the roses be the centerpiece of her costume and kept her hair and makeup subtle and natural with radiant \"glazed\" skin, deep rose lips, and a hint of shimmery pink eye shadow, then finished off the costume with a pale pink and white manicure. She wore no jewelry or accessories other than her engagement diamond and a pair of pale pink ankle-strap sandals. While Casta wore the rose look with Raphaelite ringlet curls, Bieber decided on loose brunette waves for a more modern approach. I just have one question, Hailey: Are those real roses? Hopefully, you de-thorned them if so!Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Later on during Halloweekend, Bieber ditched the angelic florals of her first costume in favor of something darker: a \"Versace Vampire.\" The model donned a strappy black bustier top and high-waisted black skirt with a black and gold Versace logo belt, opera-length shiny black latex gloves, and a pair of vampire fangs for the Goth-inspired vampire moment. A black wig, bright purple eyeshadow, flushed cheeks, and blood-red lips (obviously), plus chunky gold necklaces and huge gold and pearl earrings added to the glamourous \\'90s Versace vibe; she could have walked right off a Gianni Versace runway, minus the fangs.Instagram/Hailey BieberThe two looks may have been complete opposites, but they paid homage to Bieber\\'s fashion roots in the most gorgeously spooky and stunning way.More celeb Halloween looks you may have missed:The Kardashian\\'s Halloween Costumes Included Mystique, Bride of Frankenstein and Jessie from Toy StoryYou Have to See Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly as Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee for HalloweenMegan Thee Stallion Has Outdone Herself in the Halloween Nail Art DepartmentMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNow, learn Hailey\\'s 10 biggest beauty tips:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'TikTok-turned-reality star Dixie D\\'Amelio finally committed to the hairstyle she\\'s been longing for since sixth grade.

You can find plenty of examples across social media. Just look to hashtags #tonguepiercing and #tonguepiercings on TikTok and Instagram, which have over 790 million views and 520,000 posts, respectively.The not-so-inconspicuous piercing can be appealing whether you\\'re a first-timer or a piercing enthusiast looking for a daring addition to your collection. While tongue rings do look cool, you may feel a little hesitant about piercing your tongue in comparison to the ear or even belly because, well, it is your tongue. The stakes seem higher and more dangerous should an infection occur.But despite the location, the aftercare for tongue piercings is actually a lot easier (and a lot less painful) than some would expect. Here\\'s everything you need to know before scheduling your piercing appointment, whether you\\'re undecided about taking the plunge or ready to get your tongue pierced tomorrow.Meet the experts:Jenna Myers, a piercer at Live By the Sword Tattoo in New York CityErich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone HealthLynn Loheide, a body piercer based in Nashville, TennesseeAre tongue piercings dangerous?Before you even think about setting up your appointment, it\\'s important to understand the risks associated with tongue piercings. Like any piercing, there\\'s always a possibility of infection or rejection.Sometimes the signs of infection can be easy to confuse with irritation in piercings, especially if you\\'re extra paranoid. But New York City-based piercer Jenna Myers says that there tends to be a pretty big distinction between the two.\"[With an] infection, your tongue is going to look absolutely wild,\" Myers shares. \"It\\'ll be two to three times the size, turning almost green or white, [with puss].\" When that happens, she always advises going to the ER for professional help. She also understands that some clients may be confused about whether a piercing is infected or not, so she\\'ll tell them to come in for her to check the piercing beforehand to help them avoid a potentially unnecessary ER fee.Erich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone Health, notes that pus, severe tongue swelling, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and difficult breathing indicate that it\\'s time to seek out a medical professional. Typically, infected piercings are usually treated with antibiotics and the removal of jewelry, he explains.But there are some rare cases where surgery might be needed to drain an abscess or deal with any other complications, according to Dr. Voigt. For example, he once had to perform an emergency surgery on a patient because their tongue started to fill with blood and swell, leading them to choke. \"Fortunately, I was able to take the person to the operating room, remove the piercing (which was difficult because half of it became incorporated into the swollen tongue), incise the tongue, tie off a bleeding artery and well as cauterize the muscles, and then suture the tongue back together,\" Dr. Voigt shares.Luckily, not every tongue piercing will become infected. Still, it\\'s important to note that regardless of placement, the piercing can cause damage to the teeth and gums, according to piercer Lynn Loheide and Dr. Voigt. \"You need to understand that going into it, be okay with that risk, and also know what you have to do to minimize that risk,\" Loheide shares.Are horizontal \"snake eyes\" tongue piercings safe?Speaking of placement, there are restrictions as to where the tongue piercing can go. You might have heard of snake eyes before. For those who are unfamiliar, this style typically refers to a horizontal tongue piercing at the tip of the tongue. And if you had hopes of getting that piercing, keep dreaming. Unfortunately, experts say that tongue piercings should only go vertically through the tongue because horizontal placement comes with a big risk of damage to the teeth and gum recession.\"When we\\'re piercing vertically, especially in the center, we\\'re piercing through a connective tissue between those muscles,\" Loheide explains. \"But when you\\'re piercing horizontally, you\\'re actually pinning those muscles together, and that can cause a lot of damage.\" They also note that in the state of Oregon, horizontal tongue piercings are banned for this reason.Can anyone get a tongue piercing?Though everyone\\'s tongue is different, Loheide says if your tongue is too short or you have a tongue-tie — which is basically when the webbing underneath your tongue comes almost or all the way to the tip — a tongue piercing is probably not the best option for you.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen you arrive at your appointment, don\\'t be surprised if the piercer starts analyzing your mouth. In fact, that\\'s a good sign because your unique anatomy will dictate where you can and can\\'t get pierced, and any reputable piercer will ensure to take that into account, Loheide shares.\"We want to see where the blood flow is along the underside of the tongue and make sure that we\\'re not too close to it,\" they explain. \"But we also want to look at the shape of someone\\'s teeth and someone\\'s mouth when we\\'re deciding placement.\" That way, a piercer can ensure that they aren\\'t causing unnecessary damage and that the jewelry won\\'t rub up uncomfortably against your teeth.What can I expect during a tongue piercing appointment?Before your appointment, it\\'s imperative that you brush your teeth and tongue before arriving. Myers shares that typically her clients are given mouthwash right before to help clean their mouths out.As mentioned above, most of your appointment will be spent on prepping and checking your tongue before the needle is inserted. The actual piercing part of the session is short, just like most other piercings — a hollow needle is pushed through the tongue, and then the piercer adds the jewelry, which is a barbell shape.For standard tongue piercings, the ring is usually in the center of the tongue. Though horizontal piercings are a big no-no, you can still get two vertical tongue piercings. Some may call them venom piercings, but Loheide prefers to just refer to them as paired tongue piercings because for some people venom refers to two horizontal piercings, and the slang terms used change over time.\"Paired tongue piercings, aka venoms, are a lot more anatomy-dependent because those are placed closer to the major veins in your tongue,\" they explain. \"So we have to make sure that there\\'s space around that blood flow for them to be placed safely.\"Like any piercing, you should expect pain, and though it\\'s subjective, Loheide and Myers both swear that a tongue piercing is not as bad as you might think. \"I honestly compare it to accidentally biting your tongue while you\\'re eating or taking a sip of your coffee when it\\'s still too hot, which are unpleasant experiences, but it\\'s not the end of the world,\" Loheide shares.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn fact, they say that the most uncomfortable part is having the piercer\\'s hands in your mouth for an extended amount of time. Myers notes that on a scale of one to 10, most of her clients rate standard tongue piercings between a one to three, and paired tongue piercings a three to five.What does aftercare for a tongue piercing look like?There are a few things to expect immediately after your piercing. If you\\'ve been pierced before, some of these won\\'t be too shocking, but there are certain effects that are specific to tongue piercings.Right after your appointment, expect your tongue to be a bit swollen and painful for about one to two weeks, according to Loheide. That\\'s naturally going to happen because the piercing is a fresh wound. In addition to the pain and swelling, you\\'ll also deal with a slight lisp or change in how you speak. \"After about a week, the swelling will go down, and then the rest of the healing process is pretty easy,\" they share.Myers estimates that for a single tongue piercing, it will take about one to three months and three to five for paired piercings. \"Because the tongue is so vascular, it has a lot of blood flow to it, so it heals really quickly,\" she says. On the other hand, Loheide says to expect it to take about three to five months to be fully healed.Thankfully, the aftercare for tongue piercings isn\\'t too complicated. In general, maintaining good oral hygiene — brushing your teeth regularly and flossing — is important. Once you get home, Loheide recommends immediately changing out your toothbrush for a new one and using milder oral hygiene products. They advise avoiding toothpaste with whitening ingredients.Both piercers strongly suggest using an alcohol-free mouthwash that won\\'t burn your mouth. Loheide likes Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse because it doesn\\'t taste as badly as some alcohol-free mouthwashes do, it\\'s affordable, and can be found in most drug stores. Myers also recommends sterile saline solution, which tends to be recommended for most piercings.Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse$10Apart from switching up your oral products, you may have to change what you eat, but only for a short while. Myers suggests avoiding spicy, crunchy, and acidic foods in the first few weeks to avoid irritation. \"Things that you wouldn\\'t [want on] a paper cut, basically, you don\\'t want to eat the first few weeks of a tongue piercing, because it will cause serious discomfort,\" she says.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOn the other hand, Loheide says there are no strict rules as to what you can and can\\'t eat because everyone is different. But you still have to be mindful of how your mouth and tongue feel when you do eat or drink certain things. \"If you go to eat something and you\\'re like, \\'Wow, this feels terrible to eat,\\' don\\'t keep eating it,\" they share.Ultimately, try to not go overboard with your piercing aftercare, because that could potentially case more irritation. \"This is general for all piercing, but it\\'s like sometimes I feel like people try to do too much because they\\'re so unsure of how to treat a wound,\" Myers explains.\" Being as simple as possible with your aftercare is really best. Your body is really good at healing itself.\"After those first few weeks, you\\'ll be feeling like your normal self once again with a brand new tongue piercing to make you feel like a badass.Read more stories about piercings:7 Piercing Trends That Will Be Everywhere in 2022How to Remove Every Kind of Piercing Jewelry at HomeIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?Now enjoy the unboxing of the April 2022 Allure Beauty Box:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'Doja Cat is ready to travel to a galaxy far, far away.

Popularized in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, the timing for this resurgence makes sense: We\\'re already sticking Y2K-inspired rhinestones on our faces, breaking out the frosted eye shadow, and revisiting \"thong jeans\" so low-rise they would make even Paris Hilton blush. It was only a matter of time before bonding Swarovski crystal butterflies to our enamel made a comeback, too.Dental bling may be one of this year\\'s biggest beauty trends, but it\\'s nothing new. Anthropological records show that dentists as far back as the Mayan Empire decorated teeth with jade, gold, and turquoise, according to Anjali Rajpal, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California, nicknamed \"The Diamond Dentist\" on account of the bejeweled designs she creates for her celebrity clientele.Tooth jewelry also has significance in Black culture — a well-known example is grills, which were first worn by West Indian immigrants in the \\'70s and \\'90s hip-hop artists. Grills are decorative covers made of gold, silver, or encrusted with jewels that snap over one or more teeth and are removed at the end of each day. Tooth gems as we know them today differ from grills, but it\\'s important to recognize the cultures they\\'re derived from.Instead of a mouthful of precious metal, tooth gems are usually a single or a few delicate multi-colored gems or diamonds that are bonded individually to the teeth. Pinterest is clearly here for the trend, with the site reporting an 85 percent uptick in searches for \"tooth gems\" last year alone, while TikTok views for the hashtag #toothgems currently stand at 130.4m. \"Tooth gems add a little edge to someone\\'s style and are a less invasive way to make a statement than a tattoo,\" Dr. Rajpal tells Allure.Aesthetics aside, what about the dental health implications of these tiny adornments? We asked experts to share how tooth gems can be applied, and cared for, safely.Meet the Experts:Anjali Rajpal, DMD, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California.Michael Apa, DDS, an aesthetic dentist in New York City.Brian Kantor, DDS, a cosmetic dentist in New York City.How are tooth gems applied?Everyone\\'s bite is different, so there\\'s no avoiding a consultation first – sorry, dentist\\'s orders. \"[A consultation appointment] is also an opportunity to take my client\\'s style and personality into account when collaborating with them for their jewelry design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.If you\\'re choosing a semi-permanent tooth gem, no drilling is required: The technique is similar to the way braces are applied. \"An acidic solution (or etching gel) is placed on the tooth\\'s surface, microscopically roughening the enamel, before the gemstone is bonded to it with an adhesive and curing lamp,\" explains New York City-based aesthetic dentist Michael Apa. The whole process only takes a matter of minutes and is painless, provided the gem is bonded to the surface of a healthy tooth, Dr. Apa says. \"If you\\'ve got worn-away enamel from grinding your teeth or eating too many acidic foods, there will likely be sensitivity,\" he adds.Permanent tooth gems do require drilling a hole in the desired location, so be ready for the commitment if you\\'re planning on getting this adornment because it won\\'t be easy to remove. Also worth noting: While tooth gems can be bonded to veneers, Dr. Apa says they can\\'t be worn with Invisalign.How much do tooth gems cost?There\\'s no one-size-fits-all price tag. The cost will largely depend on your choice of design and materials (a Swarovski crystal, for example, will be cheaper than a diamond). Some dentists charge two separate fees – one for the gemstone and another for the application. \"My in-office fees include both and can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the size, quality, and quantity of the stones and the nature of the design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.How long do tooth gems last?Most tooth gems are semi-permanent and can last anywhere between six months to one year, says Brian Kantor, a cosmetic dentist in New York City. The right aftercare and dental materials used to bond the gemstone to the tooth will help you get the most out of your new dental jewelry.\"For the first 24 hours after getting a tooth gem, you should only eat soft foods and avoid using an electric toothbrush or drinking soda, coffee, or tea to protect the fresh bond,\" says Dr. Kantor, adding that picking or playing with your tooth gem is also off-limits. Sometimes a tooth gem may fall off on its own if you bite down hard on something, but Dr. Kantor says not to worry: \"There\\'s no harm to your tooth if that happens and the gem can simply be re-attached.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSemi-permanent tooth gems can also be safely removed by a dentist if you change your mind or want to switch up the design. “The gem is simply polished off along with any adhesive on the tooth,\" says Dr. Rajpal. As for permanent tooth gems, though, be warned that removing a permanent tooth gem that was inserted into a tooth will leave a hole. \"This hole will then need to be filled in with a white filling material that is color-matched to the existing shade of the tooth,\" adds Dr. Rajpal.Are tooth gems safe?If you ask Dr. Apa, tooth gems are purely an accessory. \"They\\'re a very specific aesthetic choice because they don\\'t offer the restorative benefits that come with veneers or crowns,\" he says. On top of not offering any benefits, there are a few dental risks that come with getting a set of gems.\"Tooth gems can trap plaque and create places for stray food particles and harmful bacteria to hide,\" Dr. Kantor explains. Needless to say, keeping the gem clean and practicing good oral hygiene is essential if you want to avoid gum inflammation, decay, or other dental issues. Alongside regular flossing, Dr. Apa recommends brushing twice a day with a non-abrasive toothpaste and soft bristle sonic toothbrush \"because the vibration offers a deeper clean and dislodges food stuck to the gemstone,\" he says.The bottom line? In general, as long as a dentist applies your chosen gem, and you\\'re taking proper care of your teeth at home, \"the risks are minimal,\" Dr. Apa says. In the wrong hands, he warns you could end up getting a gem with a rough surface that can cause traumatic lesions on the inside of the lip. \"Or if the gem isn\\'t placed properly, you can break an opposing tooth when you bite down,\" he cautions.So, I shouldn\\'t try applying tooth gems at home?Nope! Advice from dentists hasn\\'t stopped folks from taking the DIY route with nail art gems and superglue, but it should. \"It sounds obvious, but nobody should be ingesting toxic glue,\" insists Dr. Rajpal, who prefers to work with biocompatible materials such as gold and precious or semiprecious stones. \"Besides, glue doesn\\'t properly bond the gem to the tooth structure as well as dental materials,\" she explains. \"It\\'s far safer for a tooth gem to be applied by an experienced dentist, using a non-toxic material and polished to avoid any bacterial traps, as it will last longer, be more comfortable and hygienic.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesFor the same reason, Dr. Apa recommends a dentist remove the gem to avoid accidentally stripping away healthy enamel or tooth structure. \"You shouldn\\'t DIY anything in dentistry,\" he says. \"Tooth gem application is a dental procedure, and all procedures should be performed by a professional.\"More stories to take a bite into:I Took on Credit Card Debt to Get Braces as an AdultDentists Reveal the Correct Order to Brush Your Teeth, Floss, and Use MouthwashHow to Deal With Teeth Grinding and Jaw ClenchingNow, see how dental care has evolved over the last 100 years:', 'The 2022 MTV VMAs have barely even begun, and Lizzo is already stealing the show. The \"About Damn Time\" singer arrived at the awards show in an ensemble that was almost as dark as the black carpet she walked on. She looked like she could be princess of the underworld or even a gothic cake topper with her massive navy blue gown, dark lipstick, and golden rings on her ears, fingers, and lips.Where do you even start with a look like this? The singer\\'s navy blue gown was a gorgeous rumpled, off-the-shoulder dress from Jean Paul Gaultier. She paired it with sheer navy blue gloves that covered her forearms.Her golden jewelry was as excessive as her stunning gown in all the best ways possible. On both of her ring fingers, she wore an abstract looped ring. Earrings of various sizes covered her entire cartilage and lobe. The rings along her cartilage were thicker in width but smaller in circumference, so they hugged her ear. The hoops on the lobe were much larger, nearly skimming her shoulders. The last ring lay in the middle of her bottom lip.Getty ImagesThe lip ring combined with the dark blue lipstick and slicked back, wet-looking hair gave this look an edgier vibe that fit right in at the VMAs. Makeup artist Alexx Mayo was responsible for this glam makeup and matte lip. He painted her lips with Charlotte Tilbury\\'s Rock N Kohl liner in Bedroom Black and Eye Colour Magic Liner Duo in Super Blue to create the deep navy blue hue.Hairstylist Shelby Swain, who often works with the pop star, gave Lizzo\\'s wig the wet look using Matrix\\'s Instacure Anti-Breakage Porosity Spray and Vavooom Extra Full Freezing Spray. For the simple baby hairs, Swain used Matrix\\'s Overachiever Paste 3-in-1 Cream to keep the swoops in place.It was hard to see her nails beneath her mesh gloves, but the almond-shaped claws were painted with silver nail polish by nail artist Eri Ishizu. She used OPI\\'s GelColor in Clean State as a base before adding Chrome Effects in Mixed Metals to create an iridescent finish. Those two products are exclusive to nail artist pros, but OPI\\'s Nail Lacquer in Clean Slate and Infinite Shine in Silver on Ice work as replacements.Getty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf this was just her arrival look, we can\\'t wait for what she\\'s going to be wearing on stage when she performs.

The Emily in Paris star may be called \"classic\" or \"glamorous,\" but the actor rarely ventures into the unconventional. And you could argue the same thing about luxury brand Cartier. But apparently, when the two get together, the trendy, off-beat coolness comes out — a Collins\\'s hair is proof.In the new ad campaign for Clash de Cartier, a jewelry collection that strikes a balance between classic and eccentric, Collins does exactly that. We see her in an elegant, asymmetrical black dress and red lipstick, and her brown hair is pulled back into a sleek, low bun, not unlike the style she wore for her wedding — basically exactly how we picture Lily Collins when we picture Lilly Collins.As Billy Idol\\'s \"Dancing With Myself\" plays, she stands in contrast with another version of herself that looks completely out of her beauty comfort zone, yet it somehow works so well.

Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.On Tuesday, Collins teased a preview of the look, giving us a peek at the baby bangs, which appear to have been styled by Gregory Russell. The makeup looks were done by Fiona Stiles, and the manicures by nail artist Thuy Nguyen.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Although Collins recently told us that her curtain bangs are a \"dedicated decision\" that she\\'s wanted to do \"for years but never had the courage to take the plunge,\" it looks like she may be open to trying other, unexpected fringe looks.

Her 29th birthday look has all the elements that define her signature style: inches and inches of hair, super long acrylic nails, and lots of bling.She posted a few photos of the gorgeous birthday look to Instagram on July 4, showing off her mile-long curls nearly as white as snow, pastel purple eye makeup, and baby blue nail design full of iridescent gems. She is seen in a cutout purple dress with her platinum blonde curls cascading over one of her shoulders, the ends almost grazing her knees. Though she tends to switch up her hair color often, she\\'s indulged in her blonde era many times before with this bright hue, just like when she chopped off her hair into a platinum-blonde buzz cut right at the end of 2021.The light hair color pairs beautifully with her lavender cut crease, which also complements her gown perfectly. You\\'d think the light purple shade would also make an appearance on her nails, but not at all. Instead, this stiletto manicure was painted a light blue hue, which feels like an apt choice for the water sign. Each icy blue nail was filled with opalescent jewels of various sizes running straight down the middle.

On the 2022 red carpet, it has come in the form of elaborate headpieces, an overwhelming amount of black attire for a white-tie event, and some very funky hairstyles — especially including that of Alicia Keys.Keys walked the red carpet on May 2 in a black gown, completed by a cape bedazzled with the New York City skyline (how fitting for the singer who wrote the concrete-jungle-wet-dream-tomato song). When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection. When is it not?Getty ImagesThen I caught a look at her long braid from the side and the back and now I'm bewildered by… whatever is in her hair. As you can see below, Keys's braid is — I don't even know what word to use here — woven? Woven with something I'm finding very hard to describe. It's like a black-and-silver ribbon… made out of CDs… bedazzled CDs?Getty ImagesIn short, I have no idea what is going on with this hairstyle or what to call it, but it looks damn good. Then again, Alicia Keys could've rocked up to the Met Gala in a garbage can and she still would've made it look soulfully chic. It's what she does best.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King's Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNeed more?

On the 2022 red carpet, it has come in the form of elaborate headpieces, an overwhelming amount of black attire for a white-tie event, and some very funky hairstyles — especially including that of Alicia Keys.Keys walked the red carpet on May 2 in a black gown, completed by a cape bedazzled with the New York City skyline (how fitting for the singer who wrote the concrete-jungle-wet-dream-tomato song). When I first caught a glimpse of her from the front, all I thought was, Stunning. Her baby hairs were swooped and looped to perfection and bedazzled with some very tiny gems. Her winged eyeliner was sharper than the spikes on the Statue of Liberty's crown. Her skin was perfection. When is it not?Getty ImagesThen I caught a look at her long braid from the side and the back and now I'm bewildered by… whatever is in her hair. As you can see below, Keys's braid is — I don't even know what word to use here — woven? Woven with something I'm finding very hard to describe. It's like a black-and-silver ribbon… made out of CDs… bedazzled CDs?Getty ImagesIn short, I have no idea what is going on with this hairstyle or what to call it, but it looks damn good. Then again, Alicia Keys could've rocked up to the Met Gala in a garbage can and she still would've made it look soulfully chic. It's what she does best.More on the Met Gala:Melissa King's Gilded Manicure Jewelry Is the Best Surprise of the 2022 Met GalaBlake Lively Debuted a New Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer at the Met GalaLong Nails Ruled the 2022 Met Gala Red CarpetNeed more?

But, what if I told you there\\'s another radiance-intensifying ingredient that\\'s also a staple in your jewelry box? That\\'s right, I\\'m talking about gold, which is one of the many luminosity-amplifying ingredients in 111Skin\\'s Rose Gold Radiance Booster.111Skin is no stranger to luxury beauty: the brand has started gaining some serious hype from celebs like Kesha and it\\'s become a repeat feature in the Allure Beauty Box for its impressive, skin-nourishing formulations. Even our very own associate features director Dianna Mazzone is a fan of the brand, particularly 111Skin\\'s Vitamin C Brightening Booster. So, I already knew I was in good hands when this fancy-schmancy rose gold bottle first landed on my desk.Courtesy of brandImmediately, I did a quick scan of the label to see if my sensitive, rosacea-stricken skin could handle the formula. The serum contains a few ingredients that are already in my skin-care regimen: hydrating hyaluronic acid, brightening niacinamide, and soothing rosewater. \"The best known effect of rosewater is being anti-inflammatory, which can reduce redness and swelling in the skin,\" Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist James Wang, MD, says of the latter ingredient. \"The hydrating and antibacterial benefits, combined with its ability to calm the skin, can be especially helpful in some patients with inflammatory acne and rosacea.\"But what made me raise my eyebrows in skepticism was the pure gold extract. This may seem like a gimmicky ingredient, but Dr. Wang says that this precious metal can actually have a purpose in your skin-care routine. He notes that gold actually is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and claims of targeting fine lines and wrinkles. \"Although not a fully proven effect, gold is thought to help with wrinkles and signs of sun damage by also boosting collagen production,\" he says. With all of this in mind, Dr. Wang says this ingredient can be irritating to sensitive skin or those allergic to gold, so always patch test this product before applying it to your face.According to the bottle\\'s directions, there are two ways you can use this product: alone after cleansing or mixed into your favorite moisturizer. Whichever path you choose, the brand recommends using one to two drops. I decided to try both avenues of application simply out of curiosity and I\\'ve found that its slippery formula absorbs equally as well, regardless of how you apply it.As for its texture, the Rose Gold Radiance Booster is shimmery and has a slippery feel to it, almost like a champagne-hued version of a snail mucin serum. Once I applied it to my skin, the first thing I noticed was how teensy the gold particles were, which didn\\'t irritate my skin at all. It left a reflective veil of natural-looking shimmer without looking too intense or dramatic, and because of this, I\\'ve been reserving this sparkly serum for my morning skin-care regimen.Jennifer Hussein for AllureSo, is this gold-infused serum really worth the triple-digit price tag? Considering the fact that I\\'ve been using it daily for two months and have seen a major difference in the radiance of my complexion, my answer is a million times over, absolutely. Sure, there are many brightening skin-care products on the market, but as someone who\\'s tested hundreds of these formulations, 111Skin\\'s iridescent serum provided significant results that I haven\\'t achieved with other picks. And, at the very least, it\\'s literally liquid gold for your face, so why not treat yourself to a little luxury?111Skin Rose Gold Radiance Booster$135Want to try it for yourself?

Each design I create is a reflection of who I am.\"Short Nail Art InspirationGrowing up in Texas with family from Mexico City, Goldstein has had a wide variety of influences on her nail designs, the biggest of which was museum art. She developed an appreciation of the techniques of Diego Rivera, the Mexican painter who became Frida Kahlo\\'s husband, the color palette combinations of Josef Albers, the German artist who was the first to get solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art and the Met in New York, and the styles of her grandparents\\' house in Mexico City, which was designed by Architect Luis Barragán.\"I believe Barragán\\'s work is a study of the language of the colors of México,\" she says. \"Being surrounded by a wide palette definitely shaped my understanding of the interplay between colors and how colors affect emotions, which has impacted my designs greatly.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.When it comes to creating designs now, Goldstein uses her own style and life as inspiration. Because she uses her hands for work —through manicures and jewelry design (did we mention she owns two brands, Doublemoss Jewelry and Doublemoss Arte?) —she found that short nails are the most functional.How to Shape Short NailsGoldstein explains that shaping has the biggest impact on creating the illusion of longer nails. She\\'s a big fan of the tapered oval and square shapes but recommends avoiding flat square nails because they can make your nails look shorter. In terms of trends, every design can look good on short nails, Goldstein says, citing French tips and negative space nails as examples, but it\\'s the way the design is styled that matters.\"If you do a thick, flat French tip, it makes your short nail look shorter,\" she says, opposed to a daintier, more curved tip. \"Negative space nails work wonders for shorter nails. A clean sheer base helps minimize the attention on the nail and focus on the art.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Celebrities Who Love Short NailsWhen navigating designs with clients, Goldstein\\'s biggest goal is to make sure the nails complement the entire look, especially when doing celebrity nails for red carpet events (her résumé includes several Met Galas, U.S. press for The Batman, and The Academy of Motion Pictures Museum Opening Gala, but no big deal).Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I never want the nail art to take over,\" she says. \"Nail art is not for everyone, and I like to respect that by never pushing it on any of my clients.\"Goldstein also enjoys how collaborative the nail art process can be, naming her method with Gemma Chan, whose nails she did for the Met Gala in 2019 and 2021 and The Eternals premiere in London, as an example.\"I create a design based on what she is wearing and then consult Gemma for any tweaks or changes,\" she says. \"I love that Gemma isn\\'t scared to take risks with nails and respects the art.\"Goldstein is making major strides in bringing short nails back, and we\\'re obsessed with all of her designs. To sum it all up, we\\'d say she\\'s nailing it.

To be real, anything \"boiling over\" on our face is something we\\'d like to avoid.According to the National Eczema Association, 31.6 million people in the U.S. have some form of eczema, making it one of the most common skin conditions. If you\\'re experiencing red, irritated skin on your face (especially your eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, or chin), there\\'s a fairly good chance it\\'s facial eczema. You may already have it elsewhere on your body, or it could be on your face alone. And while there is no study evaluating the prevalence of facial eczema, specifically, New York City-based dermatologist Neil Sadick, MD, says he believes the disorder affects about a third of the population.With facial eczema, you\\'ll have to do a bit of detective work to identify what\\'s causing it. There are a few types — atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis being the two most common forms — and they act a little differently. Some types will resolve in a few weeks with treatment, while other cases are chronic and need constant management. But you\\'re not alone. There are solutions as well as ways to keep it under control.Facial eczema can be itchy, flaky, and frustrating — your face is usually the first thing people see — and with so many types of eczema to parse through, it can be overwhelming. To help, we spoke with several board-certified dermatologists to find out what exactly constitutes facial eczema, what triggers the condition, and most importantly, how to keep symptoms at bay.Meet the experts:Macrene Alexiades, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center of New York in New York City.Hadley King, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Anthony Rossi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Neil Sadick, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Adam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C.Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Read MoreBody & Mind GuideSymptoms, treatment options, and personal experiences for various physical, mental, and health conditions and concerns.ArrowIn this story:What Is Facial Eczema?Causes of Facial EczemaHow to Prevent Facial EczemaHow to Treat Facial EczemaShould I Treat Facial Eczema Differently Than I Would Eczema on My Body?What Should I Do if Over-The-Counter Products Aren\\'t Cutting It?What Is Facial Eczema?\"Eczema is an inflammation of the skin caused by either an allergen or irritant,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Anthony Rossi, MD. It can also be genetic, and triggered by irritants.Facial eczema has many different symptoms that can manifest themselves differently from person to person, but some common things to look for are red patches, itchy skin, stinging, and dryness. With darker skin tones, it also tends to be scaly, says Dr. Rossi.Eczema is a common condition that can appear anywhere on the body, but if you\\'re grappling with facial eczema, it\\'s likely on the eyelids, eyebrows, cheeks, or chin. And while it is common, you definitely should bring it to your dermatologist. \"Eczema that develops near the eyes needs special attention because the eyes themselves can be affected,\" adds Dr. Alexiades. \"Those with eczema around the eyes are more susceptible to certain eye problems such as conjunctivitis, inflamed cornea, and changes in the shape of the cornea, a condition called keratoconus.\"Causes of Facial EczemaThere are a few different types of facial eczema — which will be key in not just identifying what you\\'re dealing with, but how you treat it. The most common type of facial eczema is atopic dermatitis. \"Atopic dermatitis is genetic and flares can be triggered by dry environmental conditions, not moisturizing, stress, and allergies,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Hadley King, MD.The second type is contact dermatitis, which comes from exposure to an irritating substance or something you may be allergic to (common perpetrators are cosmetics, dyes, soaps, detergents, fragrance, or smoke — in addition to environmental allergens like pet dander or pollen). \"Some people break out in an eczema rash after eating certain foods, such as nuts, shellfish, milk, and eggs,\" says Dr. Alexiades.Try to note when you see an eczema flare and note any common denominators to your dermatologist. This should help both you and your dermatologist narrow it down and get to the root cause.How to Prevent Facial EczemaThe best way to prevent eczema on the face is the most obvious but perhaps the most important method: identify the trigger and remove it. \"For example, if you notice red patches when you wear jewelry, you may be allergic to nickel. Stop wearing jewelry and your eczema may go away,\" says Dr. Alexiades. \"If you notice red itchy patches after a night out, it may be perfume that is your trigger, in which case stop wearing fragrances and look for fragrance-free cosmetics.\"The same goes for cosmetics and skincare. \"Know what’s in your skincare and if you’re prone to allergies,\" says Dr. Rossi. It may be beneficial to go on a \"product diet.\" Pare down your routine to one gentle product (a cleanser is a good place to start) and add them back in slowly, one by one, to see if you can identify which product is causing your facial eczema. Patch testing—applying a small amount of a product to the sensitive skin on the inside of the arm to see if there is a reaction within 24 hours—can also help to narrow things down.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf you find that your flare-ups happen when you\\'re stressed, you may need to identify some lifestyle changes like taking on fewer projects, getting more rest, or finding more time for mindfulness. Likewise, if you notice that your facial eczema gets worse in dry or hot weather, try to plan ahead for AC breaks, come prepared with sunscreen, and find a thicker and more reliable moisturizer that can hang on all day.How to Treat Facial EczemaSometimes, simply removing your facial eczema triggers will totally cure your skin within weeks. But if your facial eczema is very severe and you can\\'t identify any bad actors, you may want to try over-the-counter hydrocortisone or get a topical steroid prescription from your dermatologist. \"A topical corticosteroid cream will help treat any of the causes of facial eczema,\" says Dr. King. “Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects.” They can be used as needed to treat flares but not for ongoing maintenance, according to the National Eczema Association, since prolonged use can cause withdrawal side effects like red, irritated skin and pimple-like papules.Dr. Rossi adds that antihistamines can be an effective short-term solution if the eczema is caused by an allergen. Otherwise, \"there are more systemic medications for severe or widespread cases,\" he says.How to Curb Flare-upsNot all types of eczema have a surefire \"cure,\" but you can definitely make it more manageable and lessen your flare-ups. You may be able to curb irritation with good lifestyle habits, over-the-counter products, and consistent skincare with gentle but moisturizing products.\"Good, gentle care of your skin is the most important aspect of treating facial eczema,\" says Dr. Alexiades, who recommends fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products if you find that you’re prone to flare-ups. \"Consider a mild cleanser and wash your face with lukewarm water, since heat can cause a flare-up.\"Dr. Alexiades also touts the benefits of keeping your skin hydrated. She recommends moisturizers with emollient ingredients like ceramides and cosmetics that also have moisturizing ingredients. \"Having facial eczema doesn’t mean you can never wear makeup, but not all products are the same,\" she says. \"Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and shea butter.\" Moisturizers and cosmetics with moisturizing ingredients (like hyaluronic acid and shea butter) can help to protect the outer skin barrier—which can be damaged or compromised by eczema, according to the National Eczema Association.Should I treat facial eczema differently than I would eczema on my body?Yes. Both Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, and Dr. Sadick recommend using milder products on your face because the skin is thinner and more sensitive than the skin on your body. \"I would use eczema skin-care products designed for face and body respectively as they contain different concentrations of active ingredients,\" says Dr. Sadick.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesAdam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., recommends using weaker topical steroids, as he says, \"facial skin is more sensitive to the skin thinning and lightening effect of topical steroids.\" According to a study by the National Eczema Association, prolonged use of strong topical steroids can cause a host of withdrawal symptoms once you stop using the cream—like burning, stinging, papules, or pimple-like bumps. However, short-term use is safe and effective with the guidance of a dermatologist.What should I do if over-the-counter products aren\\'t cutting it?Sadly, sometimes eczema on the face can prove extremely stubborn to the point where treatment may need to be prescribed by a doctor. \"If home treatments are not helping, you may need prescription medications,\" says Dr. Shah. \"I usually prescribe either a topical steroid or a topical calcineurin inhibitor, a non-steroidal medication that can reduce inflammation and treat eczema.\"Dr. Shah says she sometimes prescribes special moisturizers called barrier repair creams for patients. And if the eczema is severe and not responding to topical treatments, other options include phototherapy, aka light therapy. There\\'s a wide range of treatment options for facial eczema, so it often comes down to trial and error in order to figure out what works for you. We\\'d recommend always consulting your dermatologist before trying anything new.Read more about caring for skin conditions:6 Skin-Care Ingredients to Add to Your Routine If You Have EczemaHow to Treat Scalp Eczema, According to DermatologistsWhy Colloidal Oatmeal Should Be Part of Your Skin-Care RegimenYou can follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on all things beauty.', 'The 2022 Met Gala is here and back on the first Monday of May. This year, celebrities were challenged with the theme, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion,\" with an emphasis on gilded glamour. Tonight, stars are showing how they\\'re channeling the essence of the Gilded Age with black gowns, lengthy nails, and extravagant headpieces.The vintage waves and slicked-back chignons may be nice, but headpieces are the star of the show at this year\\'s version of the fashion event — and rightfully so. Simple headwear like bedazzled tiaras and golden headbands made their appearance alongside elaborate fascinators and massive hats. It\\'s clear that head coverings are key to the gilded glamour theme, and here are some of our favorite ones.Flaming DiscsGetty ImagesLa La Anthony arrived earlier in the night in a burgundy two-piece with a swirly manicure and a large red headpiece that captured our attention. On one side, there\\'s a large circular piece with red ovular pieces woven together. But, on the other side, the headpiece looks completely different — large and small candy apple-red roses shine, bringing this all-over red ensemble together.Hint of PinkGetty ImagesSarah Jessica Parker took our breaths away and clearly understood the gilded glamour assignment with her black-and-white Christopher John Roberts gown and detailed fascinator. This black netted piece covers part of her face, but it gets even better as your eyes travel up. Rolled pieces of black mesh pop out at the top alongside numerous strings with tiny diamond pieces in black and white. The fuchsia flower and leaves add a touch of color to this look that just makes sense.Abstract HaloGetty ImagesWinnie Harlow stepped on the carpet in a short abstract white dress topped with an intricate white-and-golden headpiece that we can\\'t quite describe. There\\'s thin golden rods that flow from the back of her head connecting to the clear-and-white, sharp abstract pieces that curl out from the sides of her head. This piece almost reminds us of the legs of an insect.Covered in SilverGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThis is far from the first headpiece Janelle Monáe has worn on the red carpet, and it won\\'t be the last one we ooooh and ahhhh over. The black-and-silver, striped hood connects to her bedazzled gown, which is the same color, and covers her entire head. It\\'s the epitome of glamour and excellence.Tiny TiarasGetty ImagesEmma Chamberlain was in the salon for hours the day before the Met Gala to achieve this light platinum blonde hair. Her blunt bob was parted down the middle and tucked behind her ears with a silver bedazzled tiara. This tiara isn\\'t in-your-face, but the delicate piece matches her studded accessories well.Pieces of GoldGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesTommy Dorfman made a statement with her hunter green, latex dress with black leather gloves. The small golden headband on her head complements the gold pieces on her cut-out dress. Tiny squarish shapes are all over the top of the headband.Birds of a Feather Getty ImagesQuannah Chasinghorse always brings her culture wherever she goes. For the Met Gala, she paired a large feather headpiece with a voluminous, baby blue tulle dress. The feathers were attached to intricate braids on one side of her head and look stunning with her jewelry.Bathed in WhiteGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesCynthia Erivo\\'s towering white headwrap references the Tignon Laws, which was a law in the late 1800s that forced Black women to cover their hair. The white wrap is also an ode to the many types of headwraps Black women wear around the globe. We\\'re loving the height and volume of this chalk-white headpiece.Wide BrimsGetty ImagesSZA was clearly embracing the saying \"go big or go home,\" with her hot pink gown, a massive black hat, and latex gloves and thigh-high boots. The sheer size of this hat was impressive, and we would love to know if it stayed put the whole night or if she had to take it off to avoid accidentally hitting someone. At the back of the hat is a fuzzy boa that reached below the singer\\'s waist.Sequins GaloreGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSequins and gems had a huge moment at the 2022 Met Gala. Jessica Chastain decided to shine in a long-sleeve, garnet gown with a silver snake that wrapped around the dress. She paired the look with a turban headband in the same red sequins as the dress for a matchy-matchy moment. The hair accessory also has a silver element with a jeweled brooch at the very center of her head — it\\'s lavish, glitzy, and flashy, which is apt for the glamourous theme.Netted VisionGetty ImagesClaire Danes\\'s slicked-back bob was accessorized with a black fascinator that covered most of her face and ears. This netted design was on the simpler side and almost looked like a bunch of small soda plastic rings woven together.One KnotGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesLily Aldridge is another celebrity who matched her entire outfit from head to toe. Her gown, gloves, and headscarf all had the same silver-studded black design. The bejeweled scarf was tied simply right below her neck for a chic but simple look.Golden GloryGetty ImagesNatasha Poonawalla did not skimp out on any gold on the red carpet. Her brown gown was covered in sequins and accessorized with several large gold pieces of jewelry. She even added a golden headband full of multicolored jewels in different sizes. But the main attraction was the golden corset-like piece that extends into a large headpiece. Three thin metal pieces formed a trio of circles around her head and neck, covering a portion of her face. Shorter pieces of gold curl outward on the rings matched the swirly metal on her chest area.With a TiltGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNormani arrived in a velvet black two-piece set with a brand new hair color.

On June 15, the icon announced that her seventh album, titled Renaissance, is dropping on July 29. Even though she alerted her fans of the upcoming music a month in advance — a striking difference from when she released her self-titled album in 2013 without any promotion — she still made sure to keep us on our toes by sharing the exciting news in the middle of the night and appearing on the July cover of British Vogue just a few hours later.This cover is nothing short of magnificent — and the Beyhive agrees. The \"Spirit\" singer looks like royalty sitting on top of a horse in an all-black Maison Alaia gown with a massive feather headpiece. The rest of the photo shoot is just as breathtaking and extravagant. In one image, she appears in another black outfit but with a leather jacket, black box braids that hairstylist Jawara twisted into what looks like Bantu knots, and a glossy black lip, painted by her longtime makeup artist, Sir John. She looks like the baddest person to ever live sitting on top of a motorcycle instead of a horse.The hair and headpieces were clearly a focal priority in this shoot. They are striking, futuristic, and risky. In a few photos, she has dark hair instead of her usual blonde-highlighted strands, which is making some fans wonder if Queen Bey will be returning to her brunette era for this new album.Getty ImagesBut there is one other hairstyle that is sparking some strong reactions from the Beyhive. The hairstyle in question is the choppy baby fringe she wears with a gilded Schiaparelli Haute Couture outfit and jewelry. These short bangs are far from Beyonce\\'s norm and took several Twitter fans back to 2014, one of the few other times we have seen her with baby bangs.If you don\\'t remember that fringe, let me jog your memory for a second — they were thick, very blunt, and super short, stopping several inches about her forehead. She wore similar bangs in her \\'60s-inspired music video for \"Why Don\\'t You Love Me,\" which was released four years prior. She also had a pair of those stubby bangs in a brunette shade in her \"Telephone\" music video with pop star Lady Gaga.screenshot of Beyoncé from “Telephone” video\\nCourtesy of UMG/InterscopeA few fans noted how the resurgence of these bangs indicated that the Houston singer\\'s upcoming music is about to be epic.One user tweeted side-by-side photos of the spiky bangs and her baby fringe from 2014 and, \"Beyoncé is NOT playing she brought the choppy bangs out.\" Another fan compared the two photos and commented, \"Beyoncé even resurrected the chopped and screwed bangs.

Another jokingly noted that the fringe was probably styled by one of her five-year-old twins. \"I love that Beyoncé always includes her kids in her work, the fact that she got rumi and sir to cut her bangs/style her hair,\" the tweet reads.Regardless of your feelings about the baby fringe, we\\'re sure you\\'re more than excited for the upcoming album — we definitely are. Some fans are thinking it\\'s going to include disco and house influences due to rumors about artists she is collaborating with and the overall vibe of the shoot; it blends retro elements, such as a giant disco ball and platform boots, and futuristic designs. We won\\'t fully know until July 29, but we\\'re sure that Beyoncé will deliver hits as she always has.Read more stories about bangs:21 Types of Bangs to Consider If You\\'re Ready to Take the PlungeBottleneck Bangs Are the New, Daintier Take on Curtain BangsYour Guide to Styling, Maintaining, and Growing Out Curtain BangsNow enjoy this pro-dancers entire daily routine:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'In our humble opinion, nothing beats the rush of getting a needle poked through your skin for a piercing. Among the various ways to express yourself through body modification, they\\'re relatively low risk and just plain ol\\' fun.Piercing trends tend to ebb and flow. Some locations, like the ear lobe, seemingly never go out of style while other placements, like the belly button, resurge in popularity every few years or so. The COVID-19 pandemic affected many folks\\' ability to get piercings as mask-covered areas became off-limits. But, as tattoo and piercing shops open back up, more people have been willing to experiment, whether it\\'s by adding new jewelry to old holes or getting something entirely new.We chatted with a few piercers to learn about all the ear and body piercing trends you should expect in the new year. Here are the piercing trends you\\'ll be seeing everywhere in 2022.Ear CurationsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyThe ear is a popular site for piercings, but recently more folks are seeking out ear curations, according to piercer Amber Maysonet who works at Live by the Sword Tattoo. \"It\\'s basically a mapping and planning for either now or future piercings for your ears,\" she explains. Ear curations involve giving the piercer the creative freedom to choose multiple piercings for you while taking into account your aesthetic and your ear\\'s anatomy to figure out the best placements and jewelry. Sometimes these curations also involve adding new jewelry to already existing piercings to ensure everything works together.Maysonet cites social media, especially TikTok, as the reason why she thinks more people are choosing these curations. \"When you look at [these piercings], especially on social media, you see how good everything goes together and how nice [they] look on somebody else, obviously you\\'re like, \\'OMG, I can do that,\\'\" she shares.At Brooklyn\\'s So Gold Studies, piercer and founder Cassi Lopez-March requires that clients have at least three existing piercings and be willing to get one to three additional piercings during an ear curation session. She finds that more of her clients are seeking out \"full-blown ear styling\" rather than coming in with pre-determined placements because the average person does not always know what they want. \"When someone gives us free reign to kind of have fun with it, that\\'s when the magic happens,\" she shares.OrbitalsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyIf you google \"orbital piercing,\" you\\'ll see a couple of different piercing locations, but don\\'t let the internet confuse you, Cassi Lopez-March says. \"An actual orbital is just one ring that connects two holes,\" she explains. You can get two new piercings or use new jewelry to connect older ones. She has noticed this placement becoming extremely popular with clients who want to refresh their old holes and give them a new life. At her shop, they tend to add orbitals to the lobe area to connect second or even third piercings.NavalCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2017, I fulfilled one of my childhood dreams of getting a belly button piercing. I remember a friend of mine was a bit shocked that I chose the location given that it was no longer \"popular.\" But it looks like I may have been ahead of the curve (and honestly, I don\\'t make my decisions on trends alone) because both Maysonet and Lopez-March see a resurgence in belly rings coming soon.Just like fashion and beauty trends, nostalgia is winning once again with piercings, seeing as belly rings had their last heyday in the 2000s. But Maysonet has seen folks adding a bit of a twist to the placement by getting both the top and bottom of their bellies pierced rather than choosing just one or the other.Flat HelixCourtesy of Instagram/@studsFolks are becoming more interested in receiving multiple piercings at once rather than just one. \"Right now, I think the piercing trends of 2022 are being influenced by the excitement and relief of returning to travel, celebrations, and concerts with new trends of bold self-expression,\" Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of piercing studio Studs where they focus exclusively on ear piercings, shares. That\\'s why she predicts that a trio of piercings on the flat helix will be big in the new year.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe flat helix is specifically the flat area of cartilage located in the upper ear. Bubbers says it\\'s a great spot because you can try out a few different types of jewelry options and have fun with customization. She\\'s also noticed an increase in asymmetrical placements, which can be done in this area.EyebrowGetty ImagesRecently, we\\'ve noticed certain celebrities with new eyebrow piercings — some fake, some real. On September 27, Lil Nas X showed off his new eyebrow piercing on TikTok to fans\\' praise. (Since then we haven\\'t really seen it make another appearance, so who knows if the jewelry was just a fake-out.)Cardi B debuted her own eyebrow piercing during Paris Fashion Week in one of the best ways possible. She showed out in an extravagant red Mugler dress and cape with bedazzled red brows and a silver ring through her left eyebrow. The eyebrow was a popular piercing location in the \\'90s and 2000s, and it seems like it will be reentering the mainstream in 2022.Snakebites/StacksCourtesy of Instagram/@ileanastabbedmeMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2019, Studs created their signature \"Snakebite\" piercing, which model Kaia Gerber helped make popular. The name may be a bit confusing if you\\'re used to the Snakebite lip piercing — which typically means two piercings spaced out at each outer corner of the lower lip — but this is an ear piercing that involves stacking two holes close together on the outer cartilage of the mid-ear area. Bubbers says they expect to see folks trying the piercing in new places like the Forward Helix and Conch in 2022.The jewelry in these holes is just as important as the piercings themselves. Scrolling through Studs\\'s Instagram, you\\'ll see ears full of these Snakebite piercings with gold and silver jewelry in all shapes and sizes.NosesCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMaysonet has also seen an increase in nose piercings, both on the nostril and the septum. She cites the resurgence of punk, alternative, and even scene aesthetics as the impetus for this rise. We\\'re also willing to bet that once mask mandates are lifted in certain areas that it will allow more people to finally try the piercing placement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesYou can get a simple septum or nostril piercing or go all out and try two piercings, whether that be with one hole in each nostril, two holes in one nostril, or a septum and nostril piercing. It\\'s up to you to decide what kind of fun you\\'re into.With the unpredictability of the past two years, there\\'s truly no knowing what will happen in the piercing world. But we are sure that more and more folks will continue to dip into creativity and give their piercer freedom to guide them along their piercing journey.Read more stories about body modification:Contraconch Piercings Are Gaining Popularity For Their Unexpected PlacementYour Complete Guide to Vulva PiercingsHow Your Belly Button Piercing Changes When You Get PregnantNow watch 100 years of piercings:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'It almost felt like the MTV VMAs were back to their pre-pandemic form tonight at the 2022 show. Nicki Minaj, LL Cool J, and Jack Harlow hosted and kept us entertained throughout the music-filled night. Minaj was even awarded the 2022 VMA Video Vanguard award, both exciting and well deserved. In addition to these three celebs, Lizzo, Bad Bunny, and Anitta all blessed the stage with their voices.The performances were amazing, and our eyes were zoned in on what these stars were wearing from head to toe, both on and off the stage. They were already wowing us with their massive feather headpieces, face jewelry, and slicked-back hair, but we were also obsessing over all the manicures. Here are just a few that we are loving.Dove CameronGetty ImagesDove Cameron went for dark grunge vibes at the awards show. She paired her strapless leather and floral gown with smoked-out burgundy eye makeup, plum glossy lips, and stiletto-shaped nails. Makeup artist Kale Teter combined KVD Beauty\\'s Everlasting Hyperlight Liquid Lipstick in Quicksand Rose and XO Lip Gloss in Camellia for Cameron\\'s shiny pout.KVD Beauty Everlasting Hyperlight Liquid Lipstick in Quicksand Rose$22KVD Beauty XO Lip Gloss in Camellia$12Nail artist Juan Alvear added multiple 3D decals to her black-and-silver mani. For example, there were deep red rose charms and silver gems on each middle finger. If you look closely, you might have noticed the black scissor decals on each ring fingernail.Betty WhoGetty ImagesThe Australian-born singer-songwriter showed up with black-and-white graphic nails. Each hand had different nail designs. On one hand, there were various sizes of white and black stars on each nail. The other hand had white hearts on the index and ring fingers. The white design on the middle finger was actually an ode to the awards show; it\\'s the iconic MTV logo.Monét X ChangeGetty ImagesMonét X Change had already caught over eyes with her large afro puffs and bright tropical-inspired makeup, but we made sure not to forget her white swirly tips. She opted for a nude coffin-shaped manicure with a light baby pink base and various white swirls on each nail.Taylor SwiftGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe pop-country star was nominated for five awards and took home the best long-form video award.

Her bedazzled metallic nails practically blend into her dress in the above photo. The medium-length, almond-shaped nails were full of sparkly gems and jewels.Lil Nas XGetty ImagesNow, hearing the words \"goth Big Bird\" probably sounds like the strangest and worst thing in the world, but we swear Lil Nas X\\'s VMAs outfit will make you rethink that. The rapper showed out with a massive black feather headpiece with matching pants. It\\'s hard to take your eyes off this elaborate feather piece, but the mismatched manicure he wore that night also deserves some fanfare.OPI Nail Lacquer in Bubble Bath$11OPI Nail Lacquer in Black Onyx$11Two nails on each hand were painted completely black by nail artist Temeka Jackson who used OPI GelColor polishes, which are exclusively available to nail artists, to complete this look. Thankfully, the two shades she used, Bubble Bath (pale pink) and Black Onyx (pitch black), are available in nail lacquer form, so this look can be recreated at home. With the Black Onyx polish and a thin brush, she drew French tips, geometric shapes, and lines to create the nail art.Becky GGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesBecky G looked gorgeous in a sequined gown that looked just like a stained glass window.

But this time around, her video isn\\'t about her daily moisturizing routine —it\\'s focused on her newest beauty look.Hailey Bieber posted an oh-so-Y2K look to the app on March 2, just one day after husband Justin Bieber\\'s birthday. The different clips stitched together show the model in a pink velvet bathing suit (ah, a true sign of an L.A. winter) with frosty pink eye makeup and matching pink butterfly clips pulling her hair back from her face.\"Todays vibe,\" the nonchalant caption reads, along with a couple of emojis. Throughout the video, Bieber smiles and makes duck faces while she shows off her look. Her hair is middle-parted and styled with natural beach waves and baby braids. As for makeup, she\\'s opted for layered pink eye shadow: a lighter shade on her inner lids, and a darker hue on her outer lids. Pink glitter serves as her eyeliner, which rims both lash lines and extends outward into a baby wing. The monochromatic look also features a rosy blush, a pink lip color, and soft highlighter on her cheek bones. We\\'re taking notes, and plan on channeling this look all spring long.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.For her nails, she\\'s staying on-trend with a classic French oval manicure so simple that it doesn\\'t take away from her finger tattoos. And she didn\\'t miss with her jewelry either, which matches the theme of this Y2K-inspired TikTok. She\\'s wearing a few necklaces, including mixed and matched pearls with a custom letter bead necklace (although we can\\'t read what it spells out), two belly chains, and gold hoop earrings.We love all of Hailey\\'s content (shout-out to her skin-care tips, pictures with Justin, and TikTok dances), but we can\\'t get enough of her glowing beauty looks, either.

On February 23, Variety revealed its latest cover, which features the \"Truth Hurts\" singer in full-blown 1920s flapper garb including a pixie haircut, art deco jewelry, and a metallic silver shift dress. You can read the accompanying interview and see more photos over at .The real star of the whole shoot, though — at least, if you ask us — is her makeup. You can get a closer look at it right here. For the cover, Alexx Mayo (Lizzo\\'s right-hand makeup artist) created a fittingly retro face complete with a defined Cupid\\'s bow and mint-colored eye shadow that reaches from her lash line all the way up to her eyebrows. Now, those eyebrows. Let\\'s talk about them.If you were born in a certain decade, you might be getting overplucking flashbacks from the razor-thin size, high placement, and rounded arches of these eyebrows — but like it or not, that\\'s about to be very en vogue. Not only are 1920s beauty trends making the rounds on TikTok right now, but thin, arched eyebrows are all over runways, too.AB+DM for VarietyNobody has the time to achieve this look for everyday wear, but if you want to play around with a similar brow shape, take a page from Joey Healy, who previously told Allure to “take a glue stick, warm it up, and carefully run it across the brow. What this does is take away the texture of the brow and flatten it.” Set it with a few layers of powder and foundation, and you\\'re set. \"Now you can have fun on top of that canvas; I personally like to use a pomade and a brow brush to draw on that thin brow,\" Healy said.

Follow Nicola on Instagram.', 'In a world where affordable “dupes” constantly go viral, is there really a difference when it comes to luxury makeup? Anyone who’s ever cracked open a Tom Ford eye shadow palette or swiped on a Valentino lipstick will tell you: You definitely feel the difference with a premium beauty product. There’s undeniable appeal in experiencing it, from the high-end, thoughtful packaging, to the long-lasting, super-luxe formulas, and, of course, the thrill of a designer purchase — without having to spend a fortune on a single item of clothing. You’re applying products to your face every day, so why not make the investment?Experts agree high-end products stand out. “As a dermatologist, I like for the ingredients and studies/results to inform my opinion about a product’s performance,” says Karen Kagha, MD, a Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist. “Combining that with great branding, as many luxury brand names have done for years, is the best of both worlds.”Another bonus? Formulas from luxury makeup brands have also become more advanced than ever. According to cosmetic chemist and licensed aesthetician Esther Olu, the increased popularity of skin care post-2020 has led to more makeup brands prioritizing the creation of skin-care-infused formulas. Think: Foundations with ingredients you’d find in a serum (like niacinamide, vitamin C, and hyaluronic acid), or concealers with peptides and caffeine you’d expect in an eye cream. “Consumers want a natural, skin-like finish while simultaneously taking care of their skin — without looking like they have makeup on,” she says. “That is how hybrid formulations have begun and since grown.”Given the rise in interest for higher-end products, we rounded up some luxury favorites at Sephora definitely worth their price tags:Westman Atelier Vital Skincare Dewy Foundation DropsThe latest from makeup artist Gucci Westman’s cosmetics line is like a serum and foundation wrapped in one. It contains tsubaki oil, which aids skin with hydration according to Olu. As for application, Soriano says fingertips are best. Target any red areas on the face first and then apply to the rest of the face. “Use the middle and ring finger as it gives great control,” she says. “The warmth in your hands will melt the makeup into the skin, giving it a natural ‘dewy’ appearance.”Yves Saint Laurent Nu Bare Look Hydrating Skin Tint FoundationIf you’re looking for dewy skin, here’s your new favorite foundation. It’s ideal for day-to-day light to medium coverage and feels more like a moisturizer, thanks to hydrating hyaluronic acid and glycerin in its formula. “These ingredients are essentially attracting, binding, and holding water into the skin,” Olu says. “As a result of using these ingredients in foundations, it gives the skin a more hydrated, plump, and softer look.”Gucci Blush de Beauté Powder BlushThis new blush – Gucci’s first powder blush – blends like a dream. With a matte finish, it achieves the natural-looking rosiness you’d get after receiving a compliment. “A great place to add cheek color is on the cheek bone,” Soriano says. “It’s just below the outer corner of the eye. It frames the eyes and lifts the face.” She also suggests using a blush-specific brush for application (her favorite is the Sephora Collection Pro Blush Brush #93).Valentino Rosso Valentino Refillable LipstickBehold, your forever tube of lipstick. The sleek red-and-gold logo-embellished case alone is worthy of a splurge, but the swappable shades (pick from 50) really seal the deal. Soriano calls the lipstick “pure luxury” and suggests the hue ‘Blushing Nude’ for fall. “It’s a great neutral color for a lot of skin tones, and can be elevated with a lip liner or one of satin finishes on top,” she says.Armani Beauty Luminous Silk FoundationArmani’s Best of Beauty-winning foundation needs no introduction – it’s achieved fan-favorite status for its skin-like, glowy finish. You get full coverage without the weight, thanks to an oil-free formula. “Having an oil-free foundation may help improve sensory experience,” Olu says, citing a less greasy texture and appearance.Hourglass Vanish Airbrush ConcealerLike the “Paris” Instagram filter in real life, this concealer gives your skin a soft-focus finish. The full-coverage, waterproof formula contains microspherical powders, which Olu explains are like tiny hollow beads. “Microspheres possess light-reflecting benefits, which give a temporary wrinkle-filling, optical blurring effect,” she says. “Because of this light-reflecting property, this allows microspheres to even out skin tone and minimize the appearance of fine lines.”Tom Ford Eye Color Quad Eyeshadow PaletteIf there’s only one eye shadow palette you ever use, this is it. Create a range of eye looks – from subtle to dramatic – with just four shades. The shadows are incomparable for their blendability and crease-poof, long-lasting finish. As for application, Soriano suggests to “work your way from light to dark, and from flat to shine.” For a smokey eye, use the darkest color over the lid and below the lash line. “Add your highlight colors to the inner corner and browline as the high-shine color in the center of the eye,” Soriano explains.Dior Forever Skin Glow FoundationLooking for a longwear foundation? This heat- and humidity-resistant foundation won’t budge all day. Soriano suggests using a sponge blender or wedge for best application. “This type of foundation is buildable, so depending on the finish you want, you can add layers slowly for a more long-lasting wear,” she says, “But, at the same time, still having that natural glow.”Pat McGrath Labs Mothership X Eyeshadow Palette: Moonlit SeductionPat McGrath is a master of pigments, and this 10-shade palette is packed with them. You get one-swipe color payoff, velvety blending, and no creasing with this mix of mattes and metallics. From holographic lavender glitter to everyday taupe, the combinations are endless. It also comes packaged beautifully in a case that puts each shade on display like jewelry.Yves Saint Laurent Rouge Pur Couture The Bold High Pigment LipstickHere’s a tube you’ll gladly pull out of your purse for reapplication, just because of its stylish design. The black-and-gold, logo-emblazoned lipstick also boasts highly pigmented, satin-finish colors while grape oil helps moisturize lips for a comfortable wear. “Go bold and wear a statement color,” Soriano advises. “My standout favorite is 1971 Rouge Provocation.It’s gorgeous, luxurious, and one of those amazing pigments that will suit so many skin complexions.”Dior Lip Glow OilThere’s a reason this Allure Best of Beauty winner keeps selling out. The plush formula, boosted with antioxidant-rich cherry oil, doubles as a treatment and a gloss that adjusts to your pH to create a flattering, custom shade. Makeup artist Nina Soriano is a “huge fan” of this non-sticky gloss. “It’s a wonderful hybrid of lip stain and lip shine in one,” she says. “My standout favorites are ‘Rosewood’ and ‘Mahogany.’ Both colors are great for that natural lip color.’”', \"Right before Christmas 2021, Saweetie shocked fans with a bleach-blonde buzz cut. Since then, the California rapper's lengthy wigs have been nowhere to be seen. She's been giving her buzz cut the press tour it truly deserves, but it seems the hair changes aren't done because the star's blonde buzz cut is now a bright pink color.Saweetie's new hair color was revealed in an Instagram carousel she posted to celebrate her new collaboration with MAC. In the first picture, she is sitting on a table in a black silk dress and robe with lace gloves, grape-colored thigh-high boots, and silver jewelry. You can't miss the bold pink color on her head. It's not quite bright enough to be considered neon, nor is it light enough to be a pastel color. We'd call it bubblegum pink.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.In the beginning of 2020, it was clear that pink had become the it color for hair. We saw celebrities like Ciara and Jennifer Lopez jump on the trend and try the bright hue. Perhaps they inspired Saweetie to try the color, or maybe she wanted to try it just because? She's not exactly new to the world of bright hair. Though she looked great as a blonde, this color change gives her short cut a fresh new look. We wonder whether this color will be short-lived or if it will become the star's new signature shade. Regardless, we're here for it all. But if she is planning to change the color anytime soon, we'd love to see a cool cobalt blue on her head.Read more stories about short hair:50 Short Haircuts and Hairstyles to Inspire Your New LookHow to Cut Your Short Hair at Home, According to ExpertsThe '90s Bixie — a Hybrid of a Bob and a Pixie — Is Back and It's the Short Hairstyle of 2022Now enjoy YouTuber Pony Park's quick makeup routine:Don't forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.\", 'The Holiday 2022 season is officially upon us, which means we have lots of present shopping to get done. While our friends and loved ones deserve gifts along the line of private yacht rentals and jewelry adorned with carats on carats of gold, our budgets tend to present restrictions. However, thanks to the power of the Internet (and a little e-retailer called Amazon), it\\'s relatively easy to gift our parents, siblings, and best friends thoughtful presents that won\\'t break the bank. Case in point: the below Amazon finds don\\'t cost a penny over $25.Cryotherapy facials are, for example, a service that could run well into the hundreds of dollars for a single session, but a reusable ice roller can encourage similar results for only $8. Hand-poured artisanal candles from Paddywax, available in unique scent combinations like Chamomile and Fig or Sea Salt and Sage and packaged in stunning amber vessels, feel far more decadent than their $25 price tag. Touchland\\'s rosewater hand sanitizer is a far cry from the drugstore variety that\\'s become a permanent fixture in their tote bag, making it a useful gift that delivers a touch of luxury to daily life.

Even more exciting, her musical comeback arrives with a very similar Y2K look to that of her 2003 debut album, Fefe Dobson\\'s cover. Excuse us and our nostalgia, please… it might take us a minute to get over this (if we ever do).Our favorite early-2000s Canadian pop-rock singer-songwriter posted what appears to be the album cover of her next single, \"FCKN IN LOVE\" on February 11. Just like her debut cover, she\\'s once again posing in front of a blue background with her name in all caps (as it should be).A constant trendsetter of the era, Dobson\\'s hair was short and curly on the first album cover, whereas now, it\\'s styled as a straight mullet, and she\\'s proving that she can keep up with the times faster than we can. The most important part, however, is her makeup — she rocked a frosty blue smoky with a glossy lip on her first album cover. Now, she\\'s wearing a vivid, vinyl blue eye shadow covering her entire lids, hopefully foreshadowing the power of her single to come, while her lip look remains more or less the same.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Her fit? She\\'s in a leather jacket with a gray T-shirt underneath, jeans, and a few layered necklaces, whereas her debut album features a staple early-2000s look: a white cami with red bra straps showing, low-rise jeans with a belt chain, and chunky silver jewelry.\"New single FCKN IN LOVE out 2.25.22,\" she wrote as the caption. It seems more than a few are psyched about her return, as the comments section is filled with clapping emojis and quite a few \"YASS\"es.

But as lovely as both of their manicures may be in their latest nailfie, it\\'s their lavish matching jewelry that\\'s commanding the most attention.On Tuesday, November 2, Jenner posted of her own and Stormi\\'s left hands with the caption \"Daddy got us matching rings \\U0001f90d⛈.\" She\\'s referring to the sparklers on her pointer finger and Stormi\\'s ring finger, gifted by Travis Scott.

But yesterday brought good news! No, still no word on the new season — but one of its biggest stars, Evan Rachel Wood, has been keeping busy doing something extremely awesome: looking exactly like Madonna.Wood posted a photo of herself to Instagram on Wednesday, March 2, in which she\\'s dressed and made up to uncannily resemble Madonna circa 1984. The still is from Roku\\'s upcoming Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, a film about \"Weird Al\" Yankovic\\'s unusual and award-winning career, starring Daniel Radcliffe as the curly-haired king of parody songs. As those of us who lived through the ‘80s will recall, one of Yankovic’s biggest hits, \"Like a Surgeon,\" was based on Madonna\\'s \"Like a Virgin.\" (In fact, legend has it that it was actually Madonna\\'s idea.) So it makes perfect sense that she\\'d make an appearance in the biopic — and now that I see Wood\\'s photo, it makes perfect sense that she\\'d play her. With the help of makeup, hair, and wardrobe, the likeness is undeniable.\"The secret\\'s out!\" Wood wrote in the caption of the still, which shows her in a black and white, lacy, jewelry-heavy getup true to Madonna\\'s style at the time. Her dirty-blonde hair with dark roots is topped with a tulle headband. \"I am having WAY TOO MUCH FUN playing the iconic Madonna in @therokuchannel\\'s WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story with Daniel Radcliffe. ✨🙌🏻🙌🏻😱😱💋\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Allure reached out to the film\\'s talented makeup artist, Kat Bardot, who\\'s not yet at liberty to give details about the production\\'s star-transforming process. But what we can tell from the additional closeup she posted to Instagram of Wood is that she precisely shaped Wood\\'s lip line to look more like Madonna\\'s mouth, filling in with a glossy berry red shade. Wood\\'s eyes are fully lined with black pencil, and she\\'s wearing golden yellow and coppery brown shadow on her mobile lid and crease respectively. Her brows are perfectly fluffed, her cheeks are host to a bright pink blush, and of course, there\\'s a little dot next to her philtrum to represent Madonna\\'s beauty mark.In the caption, Bardot says this is \"one of a handful of looks\" she created for Wood as Madonna and that working with the actor \"has been an absolute joy.\" So I definitely can\\'t wait to see the other Madonna looks — not to mention how Radcliffe looks as Yankovic — when the movie premieres.

There\\'s a lot going on in the photo, but the first thing we noticed was her fresh set. Banana-colored and shiny, her nails appear to be acrylics or press-on nails, practically popping out of the photo. We never thought that yellow nails in the winter would work, but here we are.The Jennifer\\'s Body actor is wearing minuscule jewelry in the photo with the exception of her new two-stone engagement ring, made with both MGK\\'s and Fox\\'s birthstones, a diamond and an emerald, respectively.

Please feast your eyes on Melissa King's epic gold nail art.OK, so it technically might be jewelry, but the Top Chef winner and one of the three chefs of the night rolled onto the red carpet wearing a bracelet that extended up to cover her ring and pinky fingers.

The finger cuff came from designer Lillian Shalom and rings were from Dena Kemp.The rest of her exposed fingers and nails were kept clear of any polish, which really draws our eyeballs straight to the golden jewelry she wore.

By now we expect the pop star to capture our attention with every new look, but we didn\\'t expect her to show up to the event with short nails or intricate gold rings that look like they\\'re worth more than my student loans.The \"Say So\" singer didn\\'t hesitate to take risks for this look, something we love from her. Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas gave her a neutral smokey eye with a hint of bright yellow on the inner crease and waterline that complemented the daring gown very well.

Nail artist Saccia painted her rounded nails with pale pink OPI Nail Polish in Bare My Soul for a minimalist vibe.

The ring is mostly gold, except for the two large baby blue gems. The ring extends into a golden nail that\\'s much longer than Doja Cat\\'s own.

With the help of the right piercer, it\\'s a work of art waiting to be created. Much like makeup and fashion, there are countless types of ear piercings, and curating and customizing the layout of your jewelry — whether it‘s on your earlobes, your cartilage, or even your inner ear canal — can evoke a desired style or sensibility.Want to go preppy? Stick with a big diamond stud. More into the punk-rock look? A heavy-metal industrial piercing might be more your deal. Prefer to stick with something that feels entirely your own? Talk to a pro about curating a beautiful range of piercings — perhaps you want stacked lobes and a couple of tiny gold hoops, topped off with a shiny inner conch piercing.But unlike makeup and fashion, the possibilities aren\\'t exactly endless. There are a finite number of places to pierce an ear, and some piercers choose to focus their talents on only a few, offering a small selection of options or lobe-only piercings. Whatever your piercing ideas may be, it\\'s important to do your research before you book an appointment, including collecting some visual references to bring as inspiration. We talked to several of the industry’s top piercers to get a rundown of the latest ear piercing trends that they’re seeing everywhere in 2022.Meet the Experts:Cassi Lopez, owner of So Gold Studios based in BrooklynTJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing based in New York CityJim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda based in Philadelphia, PALisa Bubbers, co-founder and chief brand officer, Studs based in New York CityIn this story:How to Find a Good PiercerStacked EarlobesTwo-for-One (aka Snake Bite)Forward Helix PiercingFlat Helix PiercingConch PiercingTragus PiercingDaith PiercingRook PiercingIndustrial Cartilage PiercingJump ahead by clicking on a link above or keep scrolling to read about all your facial-piercing options.How to Find a Good PiercerStart with the basics: Regardless of which piercing ideas you‘re contemplating, you first need to do some homework and check that any professional is licensed, should your city or state requires it. Perhaps surprisingly, the rules will vary depending on your location: \"There\\'s no standardized license for body piercing,\" explains Jim Kelly, head piercer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. \"But definitely feel free to ask your piercers for their license. Some of them are hanging on a wall; others are in a binder. They\\'re waiting for you to ask.\"Second — and this is really an extension of step one — make sure to work with a reputable piercer who makes you feel comfortable and uses hygienic techniques. This is essential for any and all jewelry types, whether you want an antihelix or an anti-tragus piercing, a tongue barbell or a simple pair of stud earrings.Getty Images\"All items should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you,\" says TJ Cantwell, the owner of New York City‘s Studio 28 Tattoos and Body Piercing. According to Cantwell, surgical-grade titanium or gold are the best metals to put in your body, as these types run the lowest risk of infection.Your piercer will go over the aftercare routine they recommend and what to expect during the healing process, but you\\'ll likely need a saline spray to cleanse your piercing as it heals. Two more pro tips: Avoid sleeping on your newly pierced ears and wash your sheets and pillowcases regularly.With those basics out of the way, let\\'s talk inspiration and ear curation.1. Stacked EarlobesLobe piercings can mean so much more than the wonky studs you got at Claire\\'s as a kid. You can experiment with the placement of this classic to create an unconventional look. And as a perk, Lopez explains that this piercing tends to heal easily, since there\\'s the most blood flow in the lobe. So why stop at just one? Multiple lobe piercings are an accessible way to level-up your earring game, and since there\\'s no cartilage in the lower lobe, the piercing process itself isn\\'t especially painful. (It\\'s important to note, however, that pain levels are highly subjective.)2. Two-for-One (aka Snake Bite)The ear shown above houses multiple piercings (from top to bottom: Flat, Helix, Tragus, Two-for-One/Snake Bite, Stacked Lobes), but we\\'re here to talk about what Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of ear piercing studio Studs, terms a “snake bite\" (pictured here with two studs). The hallmark of a snake bite, as differentiated from stacked lobes, is the closeness of the piercings — here, you\\'ll notice that the two studs are closer to one another than to anything else on the ear.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe varied spacing allows for playful jewelry, as with the silver hoop and stud combo above, and adds a bit of personality to otherwise uniform lobe piercings. Though snake bite piercings are often done on the lobes, Bubbers points out that they\\'ve seen a rise in customers asking for the double piercing on the midi, forward helix, and conch.3. Forward Helix PiercingA forward helix is on the upper, inner part of your ear cartilage, facing forward. “The forward-helix is literally a forward-facing piercing,” says Kelly. “If you\\'re looking at someone straight-on, you\\'ll see it.” Like most cartilage piercings, it\\'ll take between three and six months to heal, he says.According to Lopez, the lengthier aftercare timeline is worth it: \"A forward helix is one of my favorite piercings,\" Lopez says. \"They are so beautiful, especially when someone has a nice amount of space and there’s a really decorative piece there.\"4. Flat Helix PiercingUnlike a forward helix, a flat helix isn\\'t meant to be seen from the front. Instead, this piercing, housed on the \"flat\" inner part of the upper ear, will be visible from the side. \"Ear cartilage piercings, in general, are more painful than a lobe piercing,\" says Kelly. \"But when it comes to cartilage piercings, helixes are pretty mild.\"5. Conch PiercingThe piercing in the inner ear is the conch, Lopez\\'s all-time favorite ear piercing. \"They\\'re just really beautiful. We don\\'t start those with rings, because the area that it\\'s in has a high chance of getting super irritated,\" she says. \"So start them with studs and then swap them to a ring, usually after six months or so.\"Also pictured: Three helix piercings. Lopez notes that the higher the part of the ear getting pierced, the longer the healing time is, as there is less blood flow the farther up the ear you go.6. Tragus Piercing\"The tragus is one of those piercings that has never really died down,\" Lopez says. \"In all of the years that I’ve been piercing, they are very consistent.\" It sits in that cute little tab of cartilage that\\'s closest to your face, sticking out from the ear. According to Kelly, a tragus piercing lands towards the higher end of the three- to six-month healing range for cartilage piercings.7. Daith PiercingA daith piercing passes through the ear\\'s inner cartilage fold. Lopez says that the daith is “super popular” right now, and he especially loves ones that include decorative rings, as seen above.Its name may be familiar thanks to a few viral stories over the years extolling the supposed headache-fighting power in getting this part of your ear pierced, but it‘s worth noting that while it is certainly a cute piercing, the actual science is by no means concrete. In short: If you want to make this your next new piercing, go for it, but don’t expect it to spontaneously free your mind from migraines.8. Rook Piercing\"A rook piercing is the little flap of cartilage at the top of your ear but below your helix,\" Lopez says. But Lopez also adds that not every single person\\'s ear can handle this type of piercing. That\\'s why it\\'s important to go into your piercing studio with an open mind. And it\\'s yet another reason to go with a licensed pro: experienced piercers will recognize when that\\'s the case.9. Industrial PiercingAccording to Kelly, industrial piercings — or what clients sometimes refer to as \"the bar\" — are one of the most popular requests at Banter right now. Though the bar connects a helix piercing to a forward helix piercing, the industrial is pierced slightly differently from its individual components, so be sure to fill your piercer in on your ideal result.Unlike other piercings, where you typically need to begin with a stud, you\\'ll leave your appointment with a bar in place. \"This one hurts a little more, because it\\'s a slightly bigger gauge,\" Kelly says. Maybe that\\'s one reason industrial piercings have earned their punk-rock reputation.', 'Ah, nipple piercings. So cute, yet so intimidating. Getting one is a little more complicated than your typical old lobe piercing, of course, and it can certainly hurt, but don\\'t let that stop you if your heart is set on it. The know-how of a trained professional and proper aftercare techniques will make the process as smooth as possible. We spoke with professional body piercers and a dermatologist about what you should know before you\\'re ready for a nipple piercing, then asked four New York City women what it was like to get theirs done. For courageous viewers, we even captured footage of one of the women\\'s piercings, done by professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 in New York City — view the full video below.Meet the experts:TJ Cantwell, owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.Cassi Lopez-March, a piercer at So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York.Kirsten Lee, a piercer at Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City.How do I find the right nipple piercer for me?It\\'s important to go to a reputable piercing shop (please don\\'t just wander into the first place you see with a flashing neon \"body piercing\" sign). Talk to friends who have had theirs done, read Yelp reviews, and check out the references of the Association of Professional Piercers.TJ Cantwell, the owner of Studio 28 tattoo and piercing studio in New York City, says it\\'s key to choose a piercer you feel at ease with. \"We always want our clients to feel comfortable in our shop. If you feel uncomfortable about the shop or your piercer, you should not get [a piercing] done,\" Cantwell says. Obviously, any legit piercer will be nothing but professional. This is someone who will be performing a body modification on your boobs, so pick someone you like. Also important: According to Cantwell, all items used by your piercer should be pre-sterilized and opened in front of you.What is getting a nipple piercing like?\"As far as what to expect, you should expect to have a great time,\" Cantwell says. Some people are more comfortable with needles and latex gloves than others, but lying back to have your nipples pierced is totally glam. Your piercer will wash up, put on gloves, and have sterile materials ready. Any reputable piercer will also act sort of like a meditation teacher, helping you keep calm and instructing you to breathe as they pierce you. The actual piercing happens very quickly. \"We tell our clients to take a deep breath in and let it out. By the time they are done letting it out, we are done with the piercing,\" Cantwell says.What type of jewelry is best for new nipple piercings?You\\'re going to want a straight barbell for the piercing: Rings move around too much and disrupt the healing process. Very rarely, a curved barbell is used for people with inverted nipples. The jewelry your piercer initially uses will be longer than what you\\'ll eventually swap it out for, to account for swelling. As for the metal, you\\'ll want to make sure that whatever you use is implant-grade. Titanium, steel, and gold work best because they\\'re less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a nickel-containing metal, says Joshua Zeichner MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Gold rarely causes a reaction in the skin. Because of the high cost of gold, titanium or steel may be used for piercings because they also carry a lower risk of causing an allergy than a nickel-containing metal,\" Zeichner says.What nipple piercing risks should I know about?As with any piercing, nipple piercings come with some potential risks, like rejection, infection, and allergic reaction. A rejection is when your body literally rejects the piercing, even to the point of pushing it out of your breasts (ouch). Your body usually rejects piercings due to improper piercing techniques, angles, and jewelry quality, so it\\'s critical to see someone who knows their stuff.Cantwell says that thankfully, nipple piercing infections are pretty rare these days due to the sterile environments and techniques used by qualified piercers. Piercings do still come with a slight risk of localized infection, although studies suggest that the chances of systemic infections — ones that spread throughout the body— are very slim. If you suspect you have any complications, you should see a medical professional straight away. \"Most of the time clients think they have an infection, they actually have an irritation, usually caused by some outside trauma to the piercing,\" Cantwell warns. \"The best way to avoid an infection is to go to a high-quality piercing studio with implant-grade materials and follow their aftercare instructions.\"As mentioned, you\\'ll want to beware of any jewelry containing nickel, because it often causes allergies and rashes. Nipple piercings do introduce a slight risk of developing scar tissue, which could potentially affect breastfeeding. \"It is difficult to predict how the nipple will react. You may be able to breastfeed without any issues, but if scar tissue develops, it can interfere with the ability of the milk to be expressed by the nipple,\" Zeichner says. It is recommended to remove your jewelry before breastfeeding, although that won\\'t remove scar tissue. \"Some people genetically are at risk for developing scar tissue, which may be permanent, even if the piercing is removed,\" Zeichner says.What\\'s the deal with nipple piercing aftercare?\"The skin is at a much higher risk of developing a reaction from a metal while the piercing is healing up,\" Zeichner says. \"A nipple piercing typically takes several months to fully heal, so you must be dedicated to proper cleaning and care after having one placed.\" Piercer Cassi Lopez-March of So Gold Studios in Brooklyn, New York, says that lifestyle plays a huge role in how well different bodies handle piercings. If you sleep on your side, don\\'t wash your sheets often, and pick at your piercing, you\\'re going to irritate them and delay the healing process.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I usually tell people, just don\\'t touch it at all. Nipples do tend to get crusty. They get a lot of build-up on them,\" Lopez says. \"One of the most important things is to not pick that. Let the hot water run on it when you shower and that should soften it up and rise that up for you.\" As for cleaning, \"Clean it with sterile saline daily and be mindful of bra types,\" she says. \"Stay away from anything too lacy at first to avoid snagging. Clean sports bras are great for fresh nipple piercings.\" She adds that while recovery time varies from person to person, it\\'s generally anywhere from six to eight months.Piercer Kirsten Lee of Studio 28 offers a clever tip for maximizing comfort and minimizing infection risk: \"Bras have a lot of bacteria in them,\" she says. \"To avoid getting any of that bacteria into the fresh nipple piercing, cut a really thin panty liner in half and stick it to the inside of the cup. It\\'ll create that barrier, help absorb sweat, and help with friction.\" Just make sure to change the liner a couple times a day, she adds.What happens if I take my jewelry out?It depends on how long you\\'ve had them in for. \"If the [jewelry] is removed before the skin heals, then the hole in the skin may heal up,\" Zeichner says. So basically, once again, don\\'t mess with or take out the jewelry during recovery time if you don\\'t want your new holes to close up. Luckily, unlike facial piercings, a nipple piercing is easy to hide should you find yourself around family or coworkers who disapprove of body modification.How much do nipple piercings cost?It varies per studio. At New York Adorned in New York City, it\\'s $40 per nipple for the actual piercing process, and that\\'s not including jewelry. Their steel jewelry starts at $35 per piece, while gold starts at $75 per piece. It\\'s also standard to tip at least 20 percent of the service charge. Call up your local shop for rates, and remember that paying for quality jewelry is more fun than paying for a doctor\\'s visit for an infected nipple.Is there anything I need to know about hooking up?Nipple piercings can take the better part of a year to heal, so get ready for some changes to your hook-up routine. If you\\'re in a relationship, consider bringing your partner with you to your piercing appointment. That way, the piercer can go over the ins and outs of what to expect with both of you. \"I always say, honestly, you\\'re not even going to want to go near them. It\\'s going to get crusty,\" Lopez says. And regardless of your relationship status, make sure any partners know to be careful with your newly pierced nipples. Hands and mouths carry germs, so wait until your pretty piercings are all healed up to enjoy them in the bedroom.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesGetty ImagesHow do people who\\'ve gotten their nipples pierced feel about the experience?Now that you\\'ve heard from the experts, check out what four people had to say about their own piercing experiences.Graduate student, 26\"I have my nose and lip pierced, as well as a few tattoos, so I\\'m pretty good with pain. I figured if I could handle those, I could probably handle getting my nipples pierced. One night I was walking through Washington Square Park, and I passed by a cool-looking tattoo place with a good vibe called West 4 Tattoo, so I went in to check it out. It was clean, had good reviews on Yelp, and the people there had done a lot of dermal piercings, which I know are really hard to do. I thought if they could do those, they could do nipple piercings.\"Then a couple weekends ago, a friend was visiting, and we just decided to walk in and do it. It was kind of a spontaneous decision. It hurt less than I thought it would because they pinch your nipple with these little tongs first, but it was still definitely a six. I tried to stand up afterward, and I was really dizzy. It was a lot of sensations.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"The bled for the first day or two, but there\\'s pretty much no pain now, except if I ding them on something or get them caught on a towel. And I make sure to wear a clean bra every day while they\\'re healing. It was the most painful of all my piercings and tattoos, but I really like them and think they look cool.\"Social media manager, 23\"I was feeling super spontaneous this week, so I decided to get my nipple pierced on a whim. I went to Studio 28 Tattoo with a few second thoughts in my mind, but told so many people I was doing it I knew I had to follow through. Plus, I wanted to be a badass.Professional piercer Kirsten Lee at Studio 28 demonstrates a nipple piercing.\\n\"I knew I was in good hands at Studio 28. I sat back in the cold leather chair and was told to take a deep breath. Next thing you know, the word \\'fuck\\' came out of my mouth. Typical. The pain lasted about 20 seconds total, as [Kirsten] pushed the needle and jewelry through. She was so calming and was constantly checking on me. I sat up and jumped in front of the mirror to check out my new champagne-color studded nipple. I instantly fell in love and I even hugged Kirsten afterward. I have had little to no pain since my piercing 24 hours ago. It has been so nice. I actually can\\'t believe it. I stared at myself for 10 minutes in my mirror last night and I now have so many tit pics on my phone.\"Freelance writer, 38\"I was about 22 when I got them. I always thought they looked hot, especially with no bra under a white tank top. And I was always impressed with people who had giant crazy things like Janet Jackson. I went to Maya Ventura at Third Eye Tattoo in Park Slope to get rings. [Editor\\'s note: Since this story was originally published in 2015, Third Eye Tattoo has closed.] She was one of the first tattoo artists to get licensed when it became legal again in New York, and she had done my first tattoo, so I was comfortable with her. The first one was like, Whoa! It was an endorphin roller-coaster feeling. And it hurt, but only for a second, and then it radiated pain. But I didn\\'t care. I was like, Yeah! Let\\'s pierce the other one! What else can we pierce?Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"And then it literally never healed. The post-traumatic nipple injury had a huge impact on my relationship with my husband. We got married in 2000, and I got the piercings in 2001, so for the first few years of our marriage, it was like, No, nope, that area is off-limits. They were always sore. I think it\\'s because I have big boobs, and they\\'re always changing size and swelling. I feel like the girls with tiny boobs and piercings have it easy. At one point one of them was rejecting, so I eventually took them both out. They looked good, but it wasn\\'t worth the hassle. Now they\\'re healed, and you can kind of see little scars if you really look. All that said, the people I know who had their genitals pierced said it healed in five seconds, and it wasn\\'t bad at all. Go figure.\"Editor, 27\"I got mine done in 2012, around the time I started dating my now-boyfriend. I remember mentioning it to him to see if it would creep him out, because if it did, I\\'d be like, OK, I don\\'t like you anymore. He was so excited and enthusiastic. I think my original inspiration was Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I had just seen the movie and thought it was so badass. It\\'s also one of those things you can cover up. No one knows I have my single nipple piercing except for a few close friends and my boyfriend.\"I did a lot of research and found this place on the Lower East Side. It didn\\'t really hurt. I thought my nose ring was more painful. The funny part was that the guy who did my piercing turned out to also live in my neighborhood, so afterward I would see him at the grocery store all the time. It was so awkward because obviously I had to take my shirt off and be topless while this guy looked at my boobs and touched them. It was just really weird. The only thing I\\'d say is that if you are not comfortable with your body or not comfortable having to care for it, you shouldn\\'t get one. I had to soak mine in a saltwater bath every night for six months, and it was extremely sensitive for the first year. If I moved it at all it would bleed. And now I still check it and clean it every day. But I love it. My boyfriend loves it. It\\'s our little secret. And it\\'s also important, because it\\'s the first thing we did together as a couple, and he\\'s the only person who\\'s ever seen it. It means a lot to me. I\\'m going to keep it forever.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookI Got a Tragus Piercing — Here\\'s What You Should Know Before Getting OneNow, see 100 years of piercings in less than three minutes:', 'To me, tragus piercings always stood for college rebellion. One of my friends got hers pierced a couple of weeks after starting our freshman year. Another got hers done while we were studying abroad in London. I, by all intents and purposes, am what one might call a \"late bloomer,\" so getting my tragus pierced at the ripe old age of 26 fits right in line with my personality.Tragus piercings are generally popular, though. \"We do at least a couple tragus piercings every day,\" says Cuba Perez, a piercer and the owner of Fundamental Body Piercing in Chicago, who himself has the unconventional ear piercing. \"The tragus has always been one of the most popular piercings around the ear.\"Though every piercing is different, there\\'s something about a snug-fitting tragus hoop or standout stud that thoroughly complements existing ear piercings — or provides an exciting, if unusual, first one. \"The tragus, like all other parts of the human anatomy, will vary in size and shape on every individual,\" says Johnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in NYC. \"I think an important part of styling a tragus is using jewelry that will highlight and compliment that person\\'s ear anatomy, literally fitting the jewelry to their ear shape, so that your client gets a one-of-a-kind curation.\"Last month, I told Beyoncé\\'s piercer to do whatever he wanted with my ears. After briefly surveying what canvas he was working with, he decided a tragus piercing was the way to go — and when Beyoncé\\'s piercer tells you that you should get your tragus pierced, you get your tragus pierced. He has a name, by the way — it\\'s Brian Keith Thompson, and he\\'s the owner of Body Electric Tattoo, a shop that celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Alba also stop by in Los Angeles. And let me just say: I am thrilled with the result.Curious about getting this part of your ears pierced? Here\\'s everything you need to know about getting a tragus piercing, including the pain level, how long it\\'ll take to heal, and how to care for it.Meet the experts:Brian Keith Thompson, owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los AngelesCuba Perez, owner and piercer at Fundamental Body Piercing in ChicagoJohnny Pearce, a piercer at Nine Moons in New York CityAdrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based studio 108Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing PagodaArash Akhavan, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York CityDr. Michael Jacobs, a board-certified dermatologist, medical technology director at Cortina, and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical CollegeIn this story:Which part of your ear is the tragus?How much do tragus piercings hurt?Are there any risks to getting this part of your ear pierced?How long do tragus piercings usually take to heal?How do you clean your new tragus piercing?How much will it cost, typically?First of all, where is your tragus?If you\\'ve never heard of a tragus before and haven\\'t figured out what it is yet, it\\'s \"the little flap of cartilage on the side of your face that covers your ear canal,\" Adrian Castillo, a piercer at Los Angeles and Brooklyn-based Studio 108 tells Allure. (He had the honor of piercing my septum earlier this year.) Still unsure of what a tragus is? Picture it like this. \"An ambulance is cruising by you and you want to close your ears, it’s that little flap in front of your ear that you can press into your ear canal,\" Thompson puts it. \"It extends from your cheek and covers and protects your ear canal.\"Some of us have a tragus that sticks further out, while others have a small flap just big enough for the earring, explains Jim Kelly, head piecer at Banter by Piercing Pagoda. As with every other piercing, the way your tragus will look with its new hardware — and whether it\\'s viewable when someone looks at you head-on, or if they\\'ll have to be facing the ear directly — depends on your individual anatomy.Kelly notes that there is also a piercing known as the \"anti-tragus,\" wherein \"anti\" just means \"across from.\" That piercing sits in the ear cartilage across the lower ear canal from the standard tragus.Adrian CastilloAn experienced piercer will only pierce your tragus with a stud, says Perez, even if you\\'re hoping to eventually switch your jewelry over to a hoop. \"Hoops are constantly moving and interrupting the healing process, so that\\'s why we like to start with studs,\" he says. After three or four months, he advises returning to your piercer, who can determine if your tragus is healed enough to handle a hoop. (Johnny Pearce is even more careful; he advises waiting at least six months before switching over from a stud.) If the tissue is pain-free, no longer pink, and no longer produces any secretion, chances are, you\\'re ready for the upgrade.How much does a tragus piercing hurt?Quite simply, it hurts a lot. It\\'s the most painful ear piercing I\\'ve ever gotten. That\\'s just my opinion, though. \"Tragus piercings hurt no more than any other cartilage piercings,\" Castillo says. This was my first-ever cartilage piercing, so I had nothing to compare it to. I figured it hurt as much as it did because it\\'s one of the thicker parts of the ear. Thompson assures me that\\'s not the case, though.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"That\\'s not how pain works,\" he says. \"Your nervous system doesn\\'t care if the part is thicker or thinner. It\\'s actually more pressure than pain, and it can be a little intimidating because you\\'re piercing into the ear canal, so you can hear everything.\" I can attest to that. That sensation lasts all of two seconds at most, though. It may feel like the longest two seconds of your life, but I forgot about the pain minutes later.If Thompson had to place the pain of a tragus on a pain scale of one through 10, though, he\\'d place it at a three or four. I\\'d say it\\'s about a five, but it\\'s all relative. Getting my tragus pierced didn\\'t hurt so much that I didn\\'t want to get my ears pierced ever again. Thompson went on to do a vertical stack of two studs on my right lobe. They felt like nothing compared to the tragus. He also pierced the lower part of the cartilage on my left ear, and that hurt significantly less than the tragus, too.Adrian CastilloAre there any risks of tragus piercings?Of course, there are always risks involved when getting a piercing. However, getting your tragus pierced is a relatively low-risk procedure when done by a professional, says Arash Akhavan, founder of Dermatology and Laser Group in New York City. \"That being said, the low blood supply to the area does make it a piercing that has a slightly higher risk for infection and poor scarring,\" he adds.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"Any piercing runs the risk of infection, bumps such as keloids, scarring, allergic reactions, tearing, and rejection (some people’s bodies try and push the piercing out of the ear),\" says Dr. Michael Jacobs, medical technology director at Cortina and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.Though the risks for a tragus piercing are relatively low, Jacobs does have a few guidelines for when to reach out to a board-certified dermatologist post-piercing. \"If the pain starts to worsen over time or it is constantly painful for over a week after the piercing you should probably visit your doctor,\" he says. If the piercing starts to look or feel infected — which can mean profuse bleeding, unbearable pain, dark pus, and a warm, throbbing feeling, visit your doctor immediately.Don\\'t believe the urban legends about nerves possibly getting hit during a tragus piercing. \"I\\'ll say in over a decade of piercing, I have never ever had anyone have any serious issue with their tragus piercings,\" Castillo says. \"I think a lot of that stuff was just spread by people who don\\'t want your ears to look pretty.\"How long does a tragus piercing take to heal?The short answer: Tragus piercings, and most cartilage piercings, take about three to six months on average to heal, while tragus piercings tend to take at least four months.\"There\\'s healed, and then there\\'s fully healed,\" says Kelly. \"When a piercing is fully healed, you can take an earring out for a long time and the hole won\\'t close up.\" The average healing time for most cartilage piercings is about three to six months, but Kelly says the tragus tends to take a minimum of four months. It\\'ll take even longer before you can take your earring out without worrying about the hole closing up — or, depending on the elasticity of your skin, your tragus may never get to that point. If you\\'d like to remove your piercing but retain the ability to put jewelry in later, pay a visit to your piercer, who can help you predict whether it will be possible.Because many of us listen to music with earphones or headphones regularly, Pearce says special care should be taken. \"The contact and pressure on the healing piercing will cause complications such as angle-shifting and even bacterial infections,\" he says. He advises switching to over-the-ear headphones, which cause less disruption than AirPods or earbuds. Akhavan recommends avoiding using earphones for the first at least four to eight weeks, though ideally until the area is completely healed.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"For the first two to three weeks, avoid sleeping on your side to prevent friction on the area,\" says Akhavan. It\\'s hard, but airplane and donut pillows help. To be safe, give your piercing about a year before taking out or changing out the jewelry.During that time, Thompson recommends leaving it alone. \"Be careful with it. Look at it; don\\'t touch it,\" he says. \"It\\'s there to be admired, not to be played with. It\\'s not a puppy.\"How do you clean your ear\\'s new tragus piercing?The only time you should get close to the tragus piercing is when cleaning it. Both piercers and Akhavan advise using unscented soap, like Dr. Bronner\\'s 18-In-1 Baby Unscented Pure-Castile Soap, and water. After sudsing the soap up in your hands, you should \"gently massage soap onto the jewelry,\" Thompson explains. \"Move the soap around the jewelry, not the jewelry around the soap. Keep the stud or hoop stationary and gently move the suds inside and out and rinse. That\\'s all you need to do.\"You can also incorporate a saline solution into your cleansing routine. Thompson likes the NeilMed Wound Wash Piercing Aftercare Fine Mist. \"Use that two or three times a day for the first few weeks,\" he says. I like to think of it as another step in my skin-care routine.How much will it cost?The price of a tragus piercing depends entirely on the studio you go to as the type of jewelry they use ranges. At 108, for example, the piercing alone will cost you $40, and an additional $120 to $180 will be added on for a stud.The writer with her fresh new tragus piercing.\\nDevon Abelman/AllureRead more about piercings:This Is What Getting Your Septum Pierced Really Feels Like9 Types of Ear Piercings to Inspire Your Next LookWhat It Really Feels Like to Get Your Nipples PiercedNow, learn about 100 years of piercings:', 'Two out of three models in this story mentioned an unexpected benefit of accessorizingone\\'s teeth: \"It\\'s a conversation starter,\" says Chloé Véro. \"People love to ask questions aboutthem.\" Alicia Drayton continues, saying, \"I can be a little anxious when it comes to, you know, interaction… so this helps with the icebreaker.\" Maybe one of your questions is: Who came up with the concept of a bejeweled smile?We\\'re not sure, but we do know that Etruscans had rings of gold welded onto their incisors and Mayans studded their mouths with jade.

She signed with a modeling agency in New York after contacting them through a submission portal. \"I sent some pictures that I took on my MacBook. And this one fire selfie that I took in a dressingroom,\" she recalls. An hour later, they replied, asking for a meeting. Lately, the 26-year-old has smiled for the camera wearing jewelry crafted by Harris: a trio of floating diamond, solid gold, and silhouetted gold caps (all are removable). \"Especially being Caribbean, something about gold just fits,\" Véro says.Solange van DoornTo create a similar makeup look: MicroLiner Ink in Yellow, LipLiner InkDuo in Magenta, and VisionAiry Gel Lipstick in Pixel Pink by Shiseido.\\nThe model remembers when she knew she wanted grills — it was after she heard the song \"Grillz\" by Nelly, which had a video she used to play on a loop growing up in New York City. \"I told myself when I was older and made my own money I’d invest in some,\" she says. More than a few modeling paychecks later (thank you, Kim\\'s Skims, Rihanna\\'s Savage x Fenty, Victoria\\'s, well, Victoria\\'s Secret), the 23-year-old did just that.

Yep, it\\'s equally as disappointing when you find an eye-catching set of earrings only to find it\\'s made of materials that could irritate your skin. Sure, they say pain is beauty, but when that pain involves itchiness, redness, and uncomfortable rashes (on an already-thin and sensitive part of your skin, no less), it begs the question: \"were these hoops really worth it?\" The short answer is, well, no.And remember: you\\'ll know if your piercing is infected if it\\'s red, inflamed, sore, hot to touch, or if it\\'s releasing puss. You should consult with your physician if you suspect you have an infection.The truth is, if you\\'re someone who struggles with finding earrings that won\\'t cause discomfort, you may have to work a little harder to find your match. \"Unfortunately, sterling silver jewelry is made with a mix of metals, often nickel, which is the most significant irritant to sensitive ears,\" explains Ottawa-based medical director of Concept Medical Samuel Hetz, MD. \"Those with sensitive ears want to find hypoallergenic rhodium-plated jewelry with low to no nickel content.\" He recommends looking for the standard benchmarks of 14k gold or above as well as sterling silver 925 grade to reduce the chances of nickel content.Because we don\\'t believe those with sensitive skin should be left out of the party, we rounded up nine of the best earrings for sensitive ears that are always stylish, and never irritating.BaubleBar Sutara 18K Gold Earrings$48 at BaubleBar$42 at NordstromFor sensitive-skinned folks, Baublebar\\'s Sutara Earrings will make you thank your lucky stars they\\'re made out of 18k gold.

All around me were people filling in or touching up their ink, but I continued onward past the buzzing needles — straight to the back, where the piercer works. After a tough year, I was ready for a bit of body modification to memorialize the challenges and symbolize the jump forward into 2022. What I didn\\'t realize, as I asked for a third lobe piercing to continue to build my stack of hoops, is that my bright idea was of a pace with a wide new piercing trend.More and more customers are asking for what Alaina Rothstein, cofounder of Los Angeles ear piercing service Leo West, refers to as a \"milestone piercing.\" Rothstein has seen mothers and daughters come in for birthday piercing; she knows of a woman who miscarried and got a stud to remind her of the loss. \"It\\'s a fun, really beautiful way to carry something special with you in happy times and in sad times,\" she says. \"And I think it\\'s like super cool that it\\'s translated [from the tattoo world] into the piercing world.\"Our piercers have seen birthdays, bachelorette parties, and groups of friends come in to celebrate together. But what trends are they trying, specifically? In other words, which parts of the ear are getting the most adoration through adornment right now?Meet the experts:Alaina Rothstein and Jill Katz, RN, cofounders of Los Angeles ear-piercing service Leo WestLisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a piercing studio with locations in New York, Texas, and California (among others)Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer at Live by the Sword Tattoo in Brooklyn, New YorkIn This Story:Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?How to Pick Your PiercerConstellation PiercingsStacked LobesVertical StacksForward HelixSnakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)ConchOuter Conch, a.k.a. SconchJump ahead, or read on for everything you need to know about the freshest ear-piercing trends, as well as the estimated length of time the healing process may take.Why Are We Getting More Piercings Right Now?Milestones are one reason customers are flocking to their local licensed piercer, but another is a generalized sense of freedom and autonomy that\\'s arrived as a result of the pandemic. \"With remote work and workplace norms overall changing, more people are feeling free to experiment with bolder looks and express their personality,\" says Lisa Bubbers, cofounder of Studs, a national piercing studio. That experimentation shows up both in the amount of piercings and in the piercings themselves, which are getting \"more creative,\" Bubbers says. (Plus, as Rothstein points out, \"one fun thing about mask-wearing is that your ears show.\")The last \"really important trend,\" as Leo West cofounder Jill Katz, RN describes it, is \"adorning what you got.\" There\\'s no normal, she says. A gorgeous earscape is all about working with your budget and your anatomy to create an embodiment of your style in tiny, beautiful silver, gold, or gem form.The result: forward helices, vertically stacked lobes, conches, sconches, snake bites, and plenty of other piercing types we never knew existed, spanning from the outer rims of the ear to the inner cartilage and back to the earlobe. Our trend-spotting piercers shared the adornments they\\'ve seen grow more popular over 2022, and what they envision for the years (and ears!) to come.How to Pick Your PiercerJust as with microblading, filler, or any other body modification, it\\'s important to find a professional piercer that you trust, with a style that appeals to you. This is an essential step, whether you’re a longtime body modification fan or it’s your first piercing ever.As Brooks notes, the benefit of following a piercer on social media is that you can seek them out and, as in one service she offers, put your ear(s) in her hands. During a \"curation\" appointment, the expert will look at your ear as a whole and help design multiple piercings to fit your style and your desires.At Leo West, that might look like getting multiple differentiated piercings on each ear. \"Symmetry is out,\" says Rothstein. As she points out, a specialist is extra helpful if you\\'re nervous about curating an asymmetrical look. \"It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t want ears that match, but it has to have a rhyme or reason to it,\" she says. \"I have two ears, and I like to say ‘one’s a little bit classy, one\\'s a little bit sassy.\\'\"Constellation PiercingsInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhile some of this year\\'s trends include holes in unexpected places, more of them involve third, fourth, or fifth additions to an already-pierced ear. At Leo West, the result is what they\\'ve named a \"constellation.\" A constellation consists of \"really small pieces, close together, closer than what your traditional spacing would be,\" explains Rothstein. The result is an \"intentionally random\" grouping of ear piercings that show off studs and gems.Stacked LobesInstagram user @leowestco\"People often come in [to the studio] and say \\'I’m not cool enough,\\'\" for a trendy piercing, recounts Janeese Brooks, a gentle piercer in Brooklyn. If you\\'re intimidated by the thought of a conch piercing or even a constellation, Brooks thinks that an ear stack is an easier entry point. These piercings are less painful than their cartilage-filled brethren, and can make their way up the lobe either evenly spaced or placed close together.Vertical StacksInstagram user @leowestcoMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"If I\\'m being honest, I love to put my hair behind my ear to show the little pops of pieces sitting right above your classic [piercing],\" laughs Rothstein. She\\'s referring to a vertical stack, which entails a piercing centered directly above your traditional first or second hole. It\\'s usually filled with a small stone or a small star, Rothstein\\'s favorite. This piercing does require a certain amount of space on the lobe, but if you have enough canvas to play with, it \"gives the ear a little extra uniqueness.\"Forward Helixcourtesy of StudsThe official name for that bouncy piece of cartilage where your ear meets your skull is the \"forward helix.\" According to Bubbers, customers are coming in requesting one or even multiple piercings on the forward helix. \"We do see new and different piercing trends emerge each year based on what’s trending in fashion, culture, and celebrity,\" she says. Celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Chantal Jeffries have helped popularize the new (and finicky — helix piercings can take up to nine months to heal) style.Snakebite (Yes, for Your Ears)In the realm of body piercing, the term \"snakebite\" typically refers to two piercings on either side of your lower lip, oftentimes barbells or studs.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen it comes to ears, however, it entails two holes placed close together, slightly separated from the rest of your ear piercings, giving the impression of that your piercer just might have used two fangs to get the job done. According to Bubbers, most customers opt for a snakebite in their “midi,\" the center point of the outer ear.ConchInstagram user @leowestcoWe\\'ve named conch piercings as of-trend for the past few years, but the cartilage piercing is still popular enough to remain on the list. It pierces through the inner-ear cartilage that makes up the back of the year. At Studs, Bubbers says customers are opting more and more for a snakebite on the conch for a doubly trendy effect.Outer Conch (Sometimes Known as a \"Sconch\")courtesy of Studs\"I hope you don\\'t use this name,\" laughs Brooks. She prefers the more medical-sounding \"outer conch,\" but the phrase \"sconch\" is catching on to describe a piercing placed at the lining ridge in the cavern space close to the center of the ear.\"It\\'s right in your eye-line when people look at you,\" she says, so it provides a way to show a bit of personality even when you\\'re on Zoom or wearing a mask. Because it\\'ll be eye-catching no matter what kind of earring(s) you have in, Brooks likes adorning an outer conch piercing with a piece of jewelry that makes a big statement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesMore on the world of piercings:How Tongue Piercings Work, From Pain Level and Placement to Aftercare and Healing TimeHow to Remove Every Type of Piercing at Home8 Types of Ear Piercings, ExplainedContraconch Ear Piercings Are Gaining Popularity for Its Unexpected PlacementIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?

That way, I have a scent memory anchored to that destination or time period for whenever I choose to relive it. My last international trip, to a prestigious wellness resort in Austria for some on-the-ground reporting, demanded a very specific choice: something compact enough to fit in my carry-on without getting tossed by TSA, calming enough to match the vibe of the Alpine oasis, and extra long-lasting so it would last through hikes, meals, and medical treatments without reapplication. Lastly, it would need to smell expensive, because my fellow wellness-seekers would expect as much — but we\\'ll get to that later.After much deliberation, I landed on a luxe new formula that had just hit my desk before my flight: the Jennifer Fisher My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil.My Scent Rollerball Perfume Oil$65I was initially surprised that Jennifer Fisher, a jewelry designer beloved by her red carpet clientele and the master behind some of Jennifer Lopez\\'s favorite hoop earrings, had ventured into perfumery. That said, fragrance does feel like a sparkling accessory that amps up any outfit or beauty look, and Fisher wanted her new perfume oil to make a statement for the wearer. \"I want anyone wearing My Scent to feel confident and sexy,\" she tells Allure. “And to smell like a fresh baked cookie.\" Upon first wear, I didn\\'t flag baked goods as a top note, but I did instantly fall for the vanilla and coconut Fisher knew she wanted to include in the formula.\"The blend of vanilla and coconut brings back memories from my childhood growing up in Santa Barbara, California,\" she says. \"For years, I was combining different vanilla and coconut fragrances to try and create my own personal scent. Finding a scent that was a combination of surf wax from the beaches in my hometown, Montecito, and a fresh baked cookie is what I\\'ve always wanted.\"Australian sandalwood, pear, and Tonka bean flank the creamy hero notes, and it all comes together to smell equal parts sunny and cozy, like throwing on a cashmere sweater on a breezy summer night. Toting it around is just as effortless too: I carried the teeny-tiny rollerball in my airplane carry-on, my spa robe to and from massages and lunch, and even in my fanny pack while Nordic walking in the mountains.No, really, I took this tube everywhere with me.\\nTaylore Glynn\"I wanted to come out with something small, compact, and portable you could throw in your bag and take everywhere with you,\" says Fisher. \"A spray to me didn\\'t feel as transportable, but that doesn\\'t mean I am ruling it out for the next product. This oil was designed intentionally to be worn and carried on-the-go.\" In addition to being totable, the formula also fulfilled my need for something that would last through spa treatments and saunas.\"Coconut is a good oil carrier to round out scents,\" says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, noting that scent can last longer in oil form because it\\'s not watered down. \"Atomized scents usually contain alcohol to help spraying. Fragrance oil is the most concentrated form [you can find].\"The scent was so powerful that even my fellow resort guests noticed. In fact, I was flagged down multiple times in the dining room and in the halls to reveal what I was wearing because it smelled \"beautiful\" and \"divine.\" For important context, some of the resort guests on the premises at the time — who I can\\'t explicitly identify — included one of the most famous supermodels of our generation, an Oscar-winning actress, and an entirely different famous jewelry designer with whom I chatted about ketamine therapy. I realized that My Scent smelled flat-out expensive, which seems to be a selling point amongst perfume enthusiasts on social media. In fact, there\\'s a whole genre of #FragranceTok posts dedicated to perfumes that make you smell, well, rich.

As she posed on the red carpet, the model and actor revealed that there was nothing but paint and pasties underneath her blazer.

No, it's not your typical choice where a lipstick shade is concerned, but makeup artists Patrick Ta and Akina Shimizu were able to pull off this muted-yet-fresh-faced makeup look on Hadid. Catch me zooming in on those lips that are seemingly matte and glossy at the same time. We're definitely not the only ones hoping the details will soon be dropped on what particular beauty brand this lipstick is made by. Nonetheless, this all-American color pallet is insanely cohesive.Let's also not forget the striking blonde hair color and the sleek, slicked-back bun hair stylist Laura Polko put together to bring out the jewelry on Hadid's ears and nose. My favorite part is the septum ring paired with the tartan-patterned Thom Browne attire styled by Mimi Cuttrell — it's full-on grunge. I'm honestly tempted to break out my alternative pop-rock playlist, like, now. Getty ImagesAdmittedly, not all of us are going to bombard the makeup aisles looking for any smoky or stormy gray lipstick shades.

Being an icon is what you do with that platform.” She not only spoke the words of a true advocate, but she also wore a statement red manicure that symbolized her mantra.All of what she said is true, and what better way to amplify that message than with a fiery manicure adorned in colors that feel empowering? The singer\\'s trusted nail artist, Eri Ishizu, looked to OPI\\'s bright red GelColor in Big Apple Red and added some edge to the manicure with the OPI GelColor in Lincoln Park After Dark. Both polishes were infused into the French accent that coated the tips of her stiletto-shaped nails.In a press release shared with Allure, Ishizu furthered the singer\\'s sentiment. \"Tonight, Lizzo was being honored for such a special award as the People\\'s Champion, and the nail look had to live up to just that.

The supermodel went for a runway-ready vibe for both of her costumes this year, though they were extremely different in tone.For her first look, Bieber covered herself in roses to pay homage to an Yves Saint Laurent haute couture runway look from 1999, originally worn by model Laetitia Casta. In her carousel of pics, Bieber wears a top and miniskirt made of huge pink roses, enhanced by a matching pink organza ruffled train at her hips. Roses also pop up on one ankle and serve as a flower crown atop her head. The look is very The Birth of Venus but make it fashion —and floral.Bieber let the roses be the centerpiece of her costume and kept her hair and makeup subtle and natural with radiant \"glazed\" skin, deep rose lips, and a hint of shimmery pink eye shadow, then finished off the costume with a pale pink and white manicure. She wore no jewelry or accessories other than her engagement diamond and a pair of pale pink ankle-strap sandals. While Casta wore the rose look with Raphaelite ringlet curls, Bieber decided on loose brunette waves for a more modern approach. I just have one question, Hailey: Are those real roses? Hopefully, you de-thorned them if so!Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Later on during Halloweekend, Bieber ditched the angelic florals of her first costume in favor of something darker: a \"Versace Vampire.\" The model donned a strappy black bustier top and high-waisted black skirt with a black and gold Versace logo belt, opera-length shiny black latex gloves, and a pair of vampire fangs for the Goth-inspired vampire moment. A black wig, bright purple eyeshadow, flushed cheeks, and blood-red lips (obviously), plus chunky gold necklaces and huge gold and pearl earrings added to the glamourous \\'90s Versace vibe; she could have walked right off a Gianni Versace runway, minus the fangs.Instagram/Hailey BieberThe two looks may have been complete opposites, but they paid homage to Bieber\\'s fashion roots in the most gorgeously spooky and stunning way.More celeb Halloween looks you may have missed:The Kardashian\\'s Halloween Costumes Included Mystique, Bride of Frankenstein and Jessie from Toy StoryYou Have to See Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly as Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee for HalloweenMegan Thee Stallion Has Outdone Herself in the Halloween Nail Art DepartmentMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNow, learn Hailey\\'s 10 biggest beauty tips:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'TikTok-turned-reality star Dixie D\\'Amelio finally committed to the hairstyle she\\'s been longing for since sixth grade.

You can find plenty of examples across social media. Just look to hashtags #tonguepiercing and #tonguepiercings on TikTok and Instagram, which have over 790 million views and 520,000 posts, respectively.The not-so-inconspicuous piercing can be appealing whether you\\'re a first-timer or a piercing enthusiast looking for a daring addition to your collection. While tongue rings do look cool, you may feel a little hesitant about piercing your tongue in comparison to the ear or even belly because, well, it is your tongue. The stakes seem higher and more dangerous should an infection occur.But despite the location, the aftercare for tongue piercings is actually a lot easier (and a lot less painful) than some would expect. Here\\'s everything you need to know before scheduling your piercing appointment, whether you\\'re undecided about taking the plunge or ready to get your tongue pierced tomorrow.Meet the experts:Jenna Myers, a piercer at Live By the Sword Tattoo in New York CityErich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone HealthLynn Loheide, a body piercer based in Nashville, TennesseeAre tongue piercings dangerous?Before you even think about setting up your appointment, it\\'s important to understand the risks associated with tongue piercings. Like any piercing, there\\'s always a possibility of infection or rejection.Sometimes the signs of infection can be easy to confuse with irritation in piercings, especially if you\\'re extra paranoid. But New York City-based piercer Jenna Myers says that there tends to be a pretty big distinction between the two.\"[With an] infection, your tongue is going to look absolutely wild,\" Myers shares. \"It\\'ll be two to three times the size, turning almost green or white, [with puss].\" When that happens, she always advises going to the ER for professional help. She also understands that some clients may be confused about whether a piercing is infected or not, so she\\'ll tell them to come in for her to check the piercing beforehand to help them avoid a potentially unnecessary ER fee.Erich P. Voigt, MD, a board-certified ear, nose, and throat doctor and director of General Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Langone Health, notes that pus, severe tongue swelling, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and difficult breathing indicate that it\\'s time to seek out a medical professional. Typically, infected piercings are usually treated with antibiotics and the removal of jewelry, he explains.But there are some rare cases where surgery might be needed to drain an abscess or deal with any other complications, according to Dr. Voigt. For example, he once had to perform an emergency surgery on a patient because their tongue started to fill with blood and swell, leading them to choke. \"Fortunately, I was able to take the person to the operating room, remove the piercing (which was difficult because half of it became incorporated into the swollen tongue), incise the tongue, tie off a bleeding artery and well as cauterize the muscles, and then suture the tongue back together,\" Dr. Voigt shares.Luckily, not every tongue piercing will become infected. Still, it\\'s important to note that regardless of placement, the piercing can cause damage to the teeth and gums, according to piercer Lynn Loheide and Dr. Voigt. \"You need to understand that going into it, be okay with that risk, and also know what you have to do to minimize that risk,\" Loheide shares.Are horizontal \"snake eyes\" tongue piercings safe?Speaking of placement, there are restrictions as to where the tongue piercing can go. You might have heard of snake eyes before. For those who are unfamiliar, this style typically refers to a horizontal tongue piercing at the tip of the tongue. And if you had hopes of getting that piercing, keep dreaming. Unfortunately, experts say that tongue piercings should only go vertically through the tongue because horizontal placement comes with a big risk of damage to the teeth and gum recession.\"When we\\'re piercing vertically, especially in the center, we\\'re piercing through a connective tissue between those muscles,\" Loheide explains. \"But when you\\'re piercing horizontally, you\\'re actually pinning those muscles together, and that can cause a lot of damage.\" They also note that in the state of Oregon, horizontal tongue piercings are banned for this reason.Can anyone get a tongue piercing?Though everyone\\'s tongue is different, Loheide says if your tongue is too short or you have a tongue-tie — which is basically when the webbing underneath your tongue comes almost or all the way to the tip — a tongue piercing is probably not the best option for you.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesWhen you arrive at your appointment, don\\'t be surprised if the piercer starts analyzing your mouth. In fact, that\\'s a good sign because your unique anatomy will dictate where you can and can\\'t get pierced, and any reputable piercer will ensure to take that into account, Loheide shares.\"We want to see where the blood flow is along the underside of the tongue and make sure that we\\'re not too close to it,\" they explain. \"But we also want to look at the shape of someone\\'s teeth and someone\\'s mouth when we\\'re deciding placement.\" That way, a piercer can ensure that they aren\\'t causing unnecessary damage and that the jewelry won\\'t rub up uncomfortably against your teeth.What can I expect during a tongue piercing appointment?Before your appointment, it\\'s imperative that you brush your teeth and tongue before arriving. Myers shares that typically her clients are given mouthwash right before to help clean their mouths out.As mentioned above, most of your appointment will be spent on prepping and checking your tongue before the needle is inserted. The actual piercing part of the session is short, just like most other piercings — a hollow needle is pushed through the tongue, and then the piercer adds the jewelry, which is a barbell shape.For standard tongue piercings, the ring is usually in the center of the tongue. Though horizontal piercings are a big no-no, you can still get two vertical tongue piercings. Some may call them venom piercings, but Loheide prefers to just refer to them as paired tongue piercings because for some people venom refers to two horizontal piercings, and the slang terms used change over time.\"Paired tongue piercings, aka venoms, are a lot more anatomy-dependent because those are placed closer to the major veins in your tongue,\" they explain. \"So we have to make sure that there\\'s space around that blood flow for them to be placed safely.\"Like any piercing, you should expect pain, and though it\\'s subjective, Loheide and Myers both swear that a tongue piercing is not as bad as you might think. \"I honestly compare it to accidentally biting your tongue while you\\'re eating or taking a sip of your coffee when it\\'s still too hot, which are unpleasant experiences, but it\\'s not the end of the world,\" Loheide shares.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn fact, they say that the most uncomfortable part is having the piercer\\'s hands in your mouth for an extended amount of time. Myers notes that on a scale of one to 10, most of her clients rate standard tongue piercings between a one to three, and paired tongue piercings a three to five.What does aftercare for a tongue piercing look like?There are a few things to expect immediately after your piercing. If you\\'ve been pierced before, some of these won\\'t be too shocking, but there are certain effects that are specific to tongue piercings.Right after your appointment, expect your tongue to be a bit swollen and painful for about one to two weeks, according to Loheide. That\\'s naturally going to happen because the piercing is a fresh wound. In addition to the pain and swelling, you\\'ll also deal with a slight lisp or change in how you speak. \"After about a week, the swelling will go down, and then the rest of the healing process is pretty easy,\" they share.Myers estimates that for a single tongue piercing, it will take about one to three months and three to five for paired piercings. \"Because the tongue is so vascular, it has a lot of blood flow to it, so it heals really quickly,\" she says. On the other hand, Loheide says to expect it to take about three to five months to be fully healed.Thankfully, the aftercare for tongue piercings isn\\'t too complicated. In general, maintaining good oral hygiene — brushing your teeth regularly and flossing — is important. Once you get home, Loheide recommends immediately changing out your toothbrush for a new one and using milder oral hygiene products. They advise avoiding toothpaste with whitening ingredients.Both piercers strongly suggest using an alcohol-free mouthwash that won\\'t burn your mouth. Loheide likes Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse because it doesn\\'t taste as badly as some alcohol-free mouthwashes do, it\\'s affordable, and can be found in most drug stores. Myers also recommends sterile saline solution, which tends to be recommended for most piercings.Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse$10Apart from switching up your oral products, you may have to change what you eat, but only for a short while. Myers suggests avoiding spicy, crunchy, and acidic foods in the first few weeks to avoid irritation. \"Things that you wouldn\\'t [want on] a paper cut, basically, you don\\'t want to eat the first few weeks of a tongue piercing, because it will cause serious discomfort,\" she says.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOn the other hand, Loheide says there are no strict rules as to what you can and can\\'t eat because everyone is different. But you still have to be mindful of how your mouth and tongue feel when you do eat or drink certain things. \"If you go to eat something and you\\'re like, \\'Wow, this feels terrible to eat,\\' don\\'t keep eating it,\" they share.Ultimately, try to not go overboard with your piercing aftercare, because that could potentially case more irritation. \"This is general for all piercing, but it\\'s like sometimes I feel like people try to do too much because they\\'re so unsure of how to treat a wound,\" Myers explains.\" Being as simple as possible with your aftercare is really best. Your body is really good at healing itself.\"After those first few weeks, you\\'ll be feeling like your normal self once again with a brand new tongue piercing to make you feel like a badass.Read more stories about piercings:7 Piercing Trends That Will Be Everywhere in 2022How to Remove Every Kind of Piercing Jewelry at HomeIs It Safe to Get Multiple Ear Piercings at Once?Now enjoy the unboxing of the April 2022 Allure Beauty Box:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'Doja Cat is ready to travel to a galaxy far, far away.

Popularized in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, the timing for this resurgence makes sense: We\\'re already sticking Y2K-inspired rhinestones on our faces, breaking out the frosted eye shadow, and revisiting \"thong jeans\" so low-rise they would make even Paris Hilton blush. It was only a matter of time before bonding Swarovski crystal butterflies to our enamel made a comeback, too.Dental bling may be one of this year\\'s biggest beauty trends, but it\\'s nothing new. Anthropological records show that dentists as far back as the Mayan Empire decorated teeth with jade, gold, and turquoise, according to Anjali Rajpal, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California, nicknamed \"The Diamond Dentist\" on account of the bejeweled designs she creates for her celebrity clientele.Tooth jewelry also has significance in Black culture — a well-known example is grills, which were first worn by West Indian immigrants in the \\'70s and \\'90s hip-hop artists. Grills are decorative covers made of gold, silver, or encrusted with jewels that snap over one or more teeth and are removed at the end of each day. Tooth gems as we know them today differ from grills, but it\\'s important to recognize the cultures they\\'re derived from.Instead of a mouthful of precious metal, tooth gems are usually a single or a few delicate multi-colored gems or diamonds that are bonded individually to the teeth. Pinterest is clearly here for the trend, with the site reporting an 85 percent uptick in searches for \"tooth gems\" last year alone, while TikTok views for the hashtag #toothgems currently stand at 130.4m. \"Tooth gems add a little edge to someone\\'s style and are a less invasive way to make a statement than a tattoo,\" Dr. Rajpal tells Allure.Aesthetics aside, what about the dental health implications of these tiny adornments? We asked experts to share how tooth gems can be applied, and cared for, safely.Meet the Experts:Anjali Rajpal, DMD, a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California.Michael Apa, DDS, an aesthetic dentist in New York City.Brian Kantor, DDS, a cosmetic dentist in New York City.How are tooth gems applied?Everyone\\'s bite is different, so there\\'s no avoiding a consultation first – sorry, dentist\\'s orders. \"[A consultation appointment] is also an opportunity to take my client\\'s style and personality into account when collaborating with them for their jewelry design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.If you\\'re choosing a semi-permanent tooth gem, no drilling is required: The technique is similar to the way braces are applied. \"An acidic solution (or etching gel) is placed on the tooth\\'s surface, microscopically roughening the enamel, before the gemstone is bonded to it with an adhesive and curing lamp,\" explains New York City-based aesthetic dentist Michael Apa. The whole process only takes a matter of minutes and is painless, provided the gem is bonded to the surface of a healthy tooth, Dr. Apa says. \"If you\\'ve got worn-away enamel from grinding your teeth or eating too many acidic foods, there will likely be sensitivity,\" he adds.Permanent tooth gems do require drilling a hole in the desired location, so be ready for the commitment if you\\'re planning on getting this adornment because it won\\'t be easy to remove. Also worth noting: While tooth gems can be bonded to veneers, Dr. Apa says they can\\'t be worn with Invisalign.How much do tooth gems cost?There\\'s no one-size-fits-all price tag. The cost will largely depend on your choice of design and materials (a Swarovski crystal, for example, will be cheaper than a diamond). Some dentists charge two separate fees – one for the gemstone and another for the application. \"My in-office fees include both and can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the size, quality, and quantity of the stones and the nature of the design,\" says Dr. Rajpal.How long do tooth gems last?Most tooth gems are semi-permanent and can last anywhere between six months to one year, says Brian Kantor, a cosmetic dentist in New York City. The right aftercare and dental materials used to bond the gemstone to the tooth will help you get the most out of your new dental jewelry.\"For the first 24 hours after getting a tooth gem, you should only eat soft foods and avoid using an electric toothbrush or drinking soda, coffee, or tea to protect the fresh bond,\" says Dr. Kantor, adding that picking or playing with your tooth gem is also off-limits. Sometimes a tooth gem may fall off on its own if you bite down hard on something, but Dr. Kantor says not to worry: \"There\\'s no harm to your tooth if that happens and the gem can simply be re-attached.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSemi-permanent tooth gems can also be safely removed by a dentist if you change your mind or want to switch up the design. “The gem is simply polished off along with any adhesive on the tooth,\" says Dr. Rajpal. As for permanent tooth gems, though, be warned that removing a permanent tooth gem that was inserted into a tooth will leave a hole. \"This hole will then need to be filled in with a white filling material that is color-matched to the existing shade of the tooth,\" adds Dr. Rajpal.Are tooth gems safe?If you ask Dr. Apa, tooth gems are purely an accessory. \"They\\'re a very specific aesthetic choice because they don\\'t offer the restorative benefits that come with veneers or crowns,\" he says. On top of not offering any benefits, there are a few dental risks that come with getting a set of gems.\"Tooth gems can trap plaque and create places for stray food particles and harmful bacteria to hide,\" Dr. Kantor explains. Needless to say, keeping the gem clean and practicing good oral hygiene is essential if you want to avoid gum inflammation, decay, or other dental issues. Alongside regular flossing, Dr. Apa recommends brushing twice a day with a non-abrasive toothpaste and soft bristle sonic toothbrush \"because the vibration offers a deeper clean and dislodges food stuck to the gemstone,\" he says.The bottom line? In general, as long as a dentist applies your chosen gem, and you\\'re taking proper care of your teeth at home, \"the risks are minimal,\" Dr. Apa says. In the wrong hands, he warns you could end up getting a gem with a rough surface that can cause traumatic lesions on the inside of the lip. \"Or if the gem isn\\'t placed properly, you can break an opposing tooth when you bite down,\" he cautions.So, I shouldn\\'t try applying tooth gems at home?Nope! Advice from dentists hasn\\'t stopped folks from taking the DIY route with nail art gems and superglue, but it should. \"It sounds obvious, but nobody should be ingesting toxic glue,\" insists Dr. Rajpal, who prefers to work with biocompatible materials such as gold and precious or semiprecious stones. \"Besides, glue doesn\\'t properly bond the gem to the tooth structure as well as dental materials,\" she explains. \"It\\'s far safer for a tooth gem to be applied by an experienced dentist, using a non-toxic material and polished to avoid any bacterial traps, as it will last longer, be more comfortable and hygienic.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesFor the same reason, Dr. Apa recommends a dentist remove the gem to avoid accidentally stripping away healthy enamel or tooth structure. \"You shouldn\\'t DIY anything in dentistry,\" he says. \"Tooth gem application is a dental procedure, and all procedures should be performed by a professional.\"More stories to take a bite into:I Took on Credit Card Debt to Get Braces as an AdultDentists Reveal the Correct Order to Brush Your Teeth, Floss, and Use MouthwashHow to Deal With Teeth Grinding and Jaw ClenchingNow, see how dental care has evolved over the last 100 years:', 'The 2022 MTV VMAs have barely even begun, and Lizzo is already stealing the show. The \"About Damn Time\" singer arrived at the awards show in an ensemble that was almost as dark as the black carpet she walked on. She looked like she could be princess of the underworld or even a gothic cake topper with her massive navy blue gown, dark lipstick, and golden rings on her ears, fingers, and lips.Where do you even start with a look like this? The singer\\'s navy blue gown was a gorgeous rumpled, off-the-shoulder dress from Jean Paul Gaultier. She paired it with sheer navy blue gloves that covered her forearms.Her golden jewelry was as excessive as her stunning gown in all the best ways possible. On both of her ring fingers, she wore an abstract looped ring. Earrings of various sizes covered her entire cartilage and lobe. The rings along her cartilage were thicker in width but smaller in circumference, so they hugged her ear. The hoops on the lobe were much larger, nearly skimming her shoulders. The last ring lay in the middle of her bottom lip.Getty ImagesThe lip ring combined with the dark blue lipstick and slicked back, wet-looking hair gave this look an edgier vibe that fit right in at the VMAs. Makeup artist Alexx Mayo was responsible for this glam makeup and matte lip. He painted her lips with Charlotte Tilbury\\'s Rock N Kohl liner in Bedroom Black and Eye Colour Magic Liner Duo in Super Blue to create the deep navy blue hue.Hairstylist Shelby Swain, who often works with the pop star, gave Lizzo\\'s wig the wet look using Matrix\\'s Instacure Anti-Breakage Porosity Spray and Vavooom Extra Full Freezing Spray. For the simple baby hairs, Swain used Matrix\\'s Overachiever Paste 3-in-1 Cream to keep the swoops in place.It was hard to see her nails beneath her mesh gloves, but the almond-shaped claws were painted with silver nail polish by nail artist Eri Ishizu. She used OPI\\'s GelColor in Clean State as a base before adding Chrome Effects in Mixed Metals to create an iridescent finish. Those two products are exclusive to nail artist pros, but OPI\\'s Nail Lacquer in Clean Slate and Infinite Shine in Silver on Ice work as replacements.Getty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf this was just her arrival look, we can\\'t wait for what she\\'s going to be wearing on stage when she performs.

The Emily in Paris star may be called \"classic\" or \"glamorous,\" but the actor rarely ventures into the unconventional. And you could argue the same thing about luxury brand Cartier. But apparently, when the two get together, the trendy, off-beat coolness comes out — a Collins\\'s hair is proof.In the new ad campaign for Clash de Cartier, a jewelry collection that strikes a balance between classic and eccentric, Collins does exactly that. We see her in an elegant, asymmetrical black dress and red lipstick, and her brown hair is pulled back into a sleek, low bun, not unlike the style she wore for her wedding — basically exactly how we picture Lily Collins when we picture Lilly Collins.As Billy Idol\\'s \"Dancing With Myself\" plays, she stands in contrast with another version of herself that looks completely out of her beauty comfort zone, yet it somehow works so well. Her hair is black with of-the-moment micro bangs, and the hairstyle is complemented by bold, black liquid-liner wings and black nail polish. Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.On Tuesday, Collins teased a preview of the look, giving us a peek at the baby bangs, which appear to have been styled by Gregory Russell. The makeup looks were done by Fiona Stiles, and the manicures by nail artist Thuy Nguyen.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Although Collins recently told us that her curtain bangs are a \"dedicated decision\" that she\\'s wanted to do \"for years but never had the courage to take the plunge,\" it looks like she may be open to trying other, unexpected fringe looks.

Her 29th birthday look has all the elements that define her signature style: inches and inches of hair, super long acrylic nails, and lots of bling.She posted a few photos of the gorgeous birthday look to Instagram on July 4, showing off her mile-long curls nearly as white as snow, pastel purple eye makeup, and baby blue nail design full of iridescent gems. She is seen in a cutout purple dress with her platinum blonde curls cascading over one of her shoulders, the ends almost grazing her knees. Though she tends to switch up her hair color often, she\\'s indulged in her blonde era many times before with this bright hue, just like when she chopped off her hair into a platinum-blonde buzz cut right at the end of 2021.The light hair color pairs beautifully with her lavender cut crease, which also complements her gown perfectly. You\\'d think the light purple shade would also make an appearance on her nails, but not at all. Instead, this stiletto manicure was painted a light blue hue, which feels like an apt choice for the water sign. Each icy blue nail was filled with opalescent jewels of various sizes running straight down the middle. We swear these pointy claws are longer than her own fingers — it might be one of the longest sets she has had to date.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Saweetie\\'s birthday look is as gorgeous and icy as we expected.

But, what if I told you there\\'s another radiance-intensifying ingredient that\\'s also a staple in your jewelry box? That\\'s right, I\\'m talking about gold, which is one of the many luminosity-amplifying ingredients in 111Skin\\'s Rose Gold Radiance Booster.111Skin is no stranger to luxury beauty: the brand has started gaining some serious hype from celebs like Kesha and it\\'s become a repeat feature in the Allure Beauty Box for its impressive, skin-nourishing formulations. Even our very own associate features director Dianna Mazzone is a fan of the brand, particularly 111Skin\\'s Vitamin C Brightening Booster. So, I already knew I was in good hands when this fancy-schmancy rose gold bottle first landed on my desk.Courtesy of brandImmediately, I did a quick scan of the label to see if my sensitive, rosacea-stricken skin could handle the formula. The serum contains a few ingredients that are already in my skin-care regimen: hydrating hyaluronic acid, brightening niacinamide, and soothing rosewater. \"The best known effect of rosewater is being anti-inflammatory, which can reduce redness and swelling in the skin,\" Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist James Wang, MD, says of the latter ingredient. \"The hydrating and antibacterial benefits, combined with its ability to calm the skin, can be especially helpful in some patients with inflammatory acne and rosacea.\"But what made me raise my eyebrows in skepticism was the pure gold extract. This may seem like a gimmicky ingredient, but Dr. Wang says that this precious metal can actually have a purpose in your skin-care routine. He notes that gold actually is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and claims of targeting fine lines and wrinkles. \"Although not a fully proven effect, gold is thought to help with wrinkles and signs of sun damage by also boosting collagen production,\" he says. With all of this in mind, Dr. Wang says this ingredient can be irritating to sensitive skin or those allergic to gold, so always patch test this product before applying it to your face.According to the bottle\\'s directions, there are two ways you can use this product: alone after cleansing or mixed into your favorite moisturizer. Whichever path you choose, the brand recommends using one to two drops. I decided to try both avenues of application simply out of curiosity and I\\'ve found that its slippery formula absorbs equally as well, regardless of how you apply it.As for its texture, the Rose Gold Radiance Booster is shimmery and has a slippery feel to it, almost like a champagne-hued version of a snail mucin serum. Once I applied it to my skin, the first thing I noticed was how teensy the gold particles were, which didn\\'t irritate my skin at all. It left a reflective veil of natural-looking shimmer without looking too intense or dramatic, and because of this, I\\'ve been reserving this sparkly serum for my morning skin-care regimen.Jennifer Hussein for AllureSo, is this gold-infused serum really worth the triple-digit price tag? Considering the fact that I\\'ve been using it daily for two months and have seen a major difference in the radiance of my complexion, my answer is a million times over, absolutely. Sure, there are many brightening skin-care products on the market, but as someone who\\'s tested hundreds of these formulations, 111Skin\\'s iridescent serum provided significant results that I haven\\'t achieved with other picks. And, at the very least, it\\'s literally liquid gold for your face, so why not treat yourself to a little luxury?111Skin Rose Gold Radiance Booster$135Want to try it for yourself? The 111Skin Rose Gold Radiance Booster is available for $135 now at dermstore.com and 111skin.com.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesRead more about our favorite luxury beauty products:I\\'ve Been Through Three Bottles of This $195 SerumTatcha\\'s The Clarifying Clay Mask Is a 5-Minute Ticket to Radiant SkinThe Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000 Is So Good, I Stopped Getting Professional BlowoutsNow, watch actress and Allure September cover star Millie Bobby Brown take on new skills:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'In 2010, when Betina Goldstein was fresh out of college, she began her career working for as a Post Production intern for a little show called Saturday Night Live, in addition to gigs in audience casting for shows such as the Food Network\\'s Beat Bobby Flay and MTV\\'s Teen Mom reunions and Hip Hop Squares.A year later, when working with a production company as a freelance production assistant on a photo shoot, one of her producers asked if she knew how to do nails.Goldstein never would\\'ve guessed that within the next 11 years, she\\'d become an ambassador for Chanel, the nail artist of an endless list of celebrity clientele, such as Zoë Kravitz, Julia Garner, Shawn Mendes,Olivia Rodrigo, and Rosalía, and amass a social following of 384,000 (and counting) Instagram followers.\"I became obsessed with teaching myself techniques to achieve greater detail and texture on this tiny canvas attached to my finger,\" Goldstein tells Allure. \"Nail art not only is my profession, but it has become a way of therapy. Each design I create is a reflection of who I am.\"Short Nail Art InspirationGrowing up in Texas with family from Mexico City, Goldstein has had a wide variety of influences on her nail designs, the biggest of which was museum art. She developed an appreciation of the techniques of Diego Rivera, the Mexican painter who became Frida Kahlo\\'s husband, the color palette combinations of Josef Albers, the German artist who was the first to get solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art and the Met in New York, and the styles of her grandparents\\' house in Mexico City, which was designed by Architect Luis Barragán.\"I believe Barragán\\'s work is a study of the language of the colors of México,\" she says. \"Being surrounded by a wide palette definitely shaped my understanding of the interplay between colors and how colors affect emotions, which has impacted my designs greatly.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.When it comes to creating designs now, Goldstein uses her own style and life as inspiration. Because she uses her hands for work —through manicures and jewelry design (did we mention she owns two brands, Doublemoss Jewelry and Doublemoss Arte?) —she found that short nails are the most functional.How to Shape Short NailsGoldstein explains that shaping has the biggest impact on creating the illusion of longer nails. She\\'s a big fan of the tapered oval and square shapes but recommends avoiding flat square nails because they can make your nails look shorter. In terms of trends, every design can look good on short nails, Goldstein says, citing French tips and negative space nails as examples, but it\\'s the way the design is styled that matters.\"If you do a thick, flat French tip, it makes your short nail look shorter,\" she says, opposed to a daintier, more curved tip. \"Negative space nails work wonders for shorter nails. A clean sheer base helps minimize the attention on the nail and focus on the art.\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Celebrities Who Love Short NailsWhen navigating designs with clients, Goldstein\\'s biggest goal is to make sure the nails complement the entire look, especially when doing celebrity nails for red carpet events (her résumé includes several Met Galas, U.S. press for The Batman, and The Academy of Motion Pictures Museum Opening Gala, but no big deal).Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah Coates\"I never want the nail art to take over,\" she says. \"Nail art is not for everyone, and I like to respect that by never pushing it on any of my clients.\"Goldstein also enjoys how collaborative the nail art process can be, naming her method with Gemma Chan, whose nails she did for the Met Gala in 2019 and 2021 and The Eternals premiere in London, as an example.\"I create a design based on what she is wearing and then consult Gemma for any tweaks or changes,\" she says. \"I love that Gemma isn\\'t scared to take risks with nails and respects the art.\"Goldstein is making major strides in bringing short nails back, and we\\'re obsessed with all of her designs. To sum it all up, we\\'d say she\\'s nailing it.

To be real, anything \"boiling over\" on our face is something we\\'d like to avoid.According to the National Eczema Association, 31.6 million people in the U.S. have some form of eczema, making it one of the most common skin conditions. If you\\'re experiencing red, irritated skin on your face (especially your eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, or chin), there\\'s a fairly good chance it\\'s facial eczema. You may already have it elsewhere on your body, or it could be on your face alone. And while there is no study evaluating the prevalence of facial eczema, specifically, New York City-based dermatologist Neil Sadick, MD, says he believes the disorder affects about a third of the population.With facial eczema, you\\'ll have to do a bit of detective work to identify what\\'s causing it. There are a few types — atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis being the two most common forms — and they act a little differently. Some types will resolve in a few weeks with treatment, while other cases are chronic and need constant management. But you\\'re not alone. There are solutions as well as ways to keep it under control.Facial eczema can be itchy, flaky, and frustrating — your face is usually the first thing people see — and with so many types of eczema to parse through, it can be overwhelming. To help, we spoke with several board-certified dermatologists to find out what exactly constitutes facial eczema, what triggers the condition, and most importantly, how to keep symptoms at bay.Meet the experts:Macrene Alexiades, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center of New York in New York City.Hadley King, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Anthony Rossi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Neil Sadick, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Adam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C.Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.Read MoreBody & Mind GuideSymptoms, treatment options, and personal experiences for various physical, mental, and health conditions and concerns.ArrowIn this story:What Is Facial Eczema?Causes of Facial EczemaHow to Prevent Facial EczemaHow to Treat Facial EczemaShould I Treat Facial Eczema Differently Than I Would Eczema on My Body?What Should I Do if Over-The-Counter Products Aren\\'t Cutting It?What Is Facial Eczema?\"Eczema is an inflammation of the skin caused by either an allergen or irritant,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Anthony Rossi, MD. It can also be genetic, and triggered by irritants.Facial eczema has many different symptoms that can manifest themselves differently from person to person, but some common things to look for are red patches, itchy skin, stinging, and dryness. With darker skin tones, it also tends to be scaly, says Dr. Rossi.Eczema is a common condition that can appear anywhere on the body, but if you\\'re grappling with facial eczema, it\\'s likely on the eyelids, eyebrows, cheeks, or chin. And while it is common, you definitely should bring it to your dermatologist. \"Eczema that develops near the eyes needs special attention because the eyes themselves can be affected,\" adds Dr. Alexiades. \"Those with eczema around the eyes are more susceptible to certain eye problems such as conjunctivitis, inflamed cornea, and changes in the shape of the cornea, a condition called keratoconus.\"Causes of Facial EczemaThere are a few different types of facial eczema — which will be key in not just identifying what you\\'re dealing with, but how you treat it. The most common type of facial eczema is atopic dermatitis. \"Atopic dermatitis is genetic and flares can be triggered by dry environmental conditions, not moisturizing, stress, and allergies,\" says New York-based board-certified dermatologist Hadley King, MD.The second type is contact dermatitis, which comes from exposure to an irritating substance or something you may be allergic to (common perpetrators are cosmetics, dyes, soaps, detergents, fragrance, or smoke — in addition to environmental allergens like pet dander or pollen). \"Some people break out in an eczema rash after eating certain foods, such as nuts, shellfish, milk, and eggs,\" says Dr. Alexiades.Try to note when you see an eczema flare and note any common denominators to your dermatologist. This should help both you and your dermatologist narrow it down and get to the root cause.How to Prevent Facial EczemaThe best way to prevent eczema on the face is the most obvious but perhaps the most important method: identify the trigger and remove it. \"For example, if you notice red patches when you wear jewelry, you may be allergic to nickel. Stop wearing jewelry and your eczema may go away,\" says Dr. Alexiades. \"If you notice red itchy patches after a night out, it may be perfume that is your trigger, in which case stop wearing fragrances and look for fragrance-free cosmetics.\"The same goes for cosmetics and skincare. \"Know what’s in your skincare and if you’re prone to allergies,\" says Dr. Rossi. It may be beneficial to go on a \"product diet.\" Pare down your routine to one gentle product (a cleanser is a good place to start) and add them back in slowly, one by one, to see if you can identify which product is causing your facial eczema. Patch testing—applying a small amount of a product to the sensitive skin on the inside of the arm to see if there is a reaction within 24 hours—can also help to narrow things down.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIf you find that your flare-ups happen when you\\'re stressed, you may need to identify some lifestyle changes like taking on fewer projects, getting more rest, or finding more time for mindfulness. Likewise, if you notice that your facial eczema gets worse in dry or hot weather, try to plan ahead for AC breaks, come prepared with sunscreen, and find a thicker and more reliable moisturizer that can hang on all day.How to Treat Facial EczemaSometimes, simply removing your facial eczema triggers will totally cure your skin within weeks. But if your facial eczema is very severe and you can\\'t identify any bad actors, you may want to try over-the-counter hydrocortisone or get a topical steroid prescription from your dermatologist. \"A topical corticosteroid cream will help treat any of the causes of facial eczema,\" says Dr. King. “Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects.” They can be used as needed to treat flares but not for ongoing maintenance, according to the National Eczema Association, since prolonged use can cause withdrawal side effects like red, irritated skin and pimple-like papules.Dr. Rossi adds that antihistamines can be an effective short-term solution if the eczema is caused by an allergen. Otherwise, \"there are more systemic medications for severe or widespread cases,\" he says.How to Curb Flare-upsNot all types of eczema have a surefire \"cure,\" but you can definitely make it more manageable and lessen your flare-ups. You may be able to curb irritation with good lifestyle habits, over-the-counter products, and consistent skincare with gentle but moisturizing products.\"Good, gentle care of your skin is the most important aspect of treating facial eczema,\" says Dr. Alexiades, who recommends fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products if you find that you’re prone to flare-ups. \"Consider a mild cleanser and wash your face with lukewarm water, since heat can cause a flare-up.\"Dr. Alexiades also touts the benefits of keeping your skin hydrated. She recommends moisturizers with emollient ingredients like ceramides and cosmetics that also have moisturizing ingredients. \"Having facial eczema doesn’t mean you can never wear makeup, but not all products are the same,\" she says. \"Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and shea butter.\" Moisturizers and cosmetics with moisturizing ingredients (like hyaluronic acid and shea butter) can help to protect the outer skin barrier—which can be damaged or compromised by eczema, according to the National Eczema Association.Should I treat facial eczema differently than I would eczema on my body?Yes. Both Sejal Shah, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, and Dr. Sadick recommend using milder products on your face because the skin is thinner and more sensitive than the skin on your body. \"I would use eczema skin-care products designed for face and body respectively as they contain different concentrations of active ingredients,\" says Dr. Sadick.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesAdam Friedman, MD, FAAD, an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., recommends using weaker topical steroids, as he says, \"facial skin is more sensitive to the skin thinning and lightening effect of topical steroids.\" According to a study by the National Eczema Association, prolonged use of strong topical steroids can cause a host of withdrawal symptoms once you stop using the cream—like burning, stinging, papules, or pimple-like bumps. However, short-term use is safe and effective with the guidance of a dermatologist.What should I do if over-the-counter products aren\\'t cutting it?Sadly, sometimes eczema on the face can prove extremely stubborn to the point where treatment may need to be prescribed by a doctor. \"If home treatments are not helping, you may need prescription medications,\" says Dr. Shah. \"I usually prescribe either a topical steroid or a topical calcineurin inhibitor, a non-steroidal medication that can reduce inflammation and treat eczema.\"Dr. Shah says she sometimes prescribes special moisturizers called barrier repair creams for patients. And if the eczema is severe and not responding to topical treatments, other options include phototherapy, aka light therapy. There\\'s a wide range of treatment options for facial eczema, so it often comes down to trial and error in order to figure out what works for you. We\\'d recommend always consulting your dermatologist before trying anything new.Read more about caring for skin conditions:6 Skin-Care Ingredients to Add to Your Routine If You Have EczemaHow to Treat Scalp Eczema, According to DermatologistsWhy Colloidal Oatmeal Should Be Part of Your Skin-Care RegimenYou can follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on all things beauty.', 'The 2022 Met Gala is here and back on the first Monday of May. This year, celebrities were challenged with the theme, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion,\" with an emphasis on gilded glamour. Tonight, stars are showing how they\\'re channeling the essence of the Gilded Age with black gowns, lengthy nails, and extravagant headpieces.The vintage waves and slicked-back chignons may be nice, but headpieces are the star of the show at this year\\'s version of the fashion event — and rightfully so. Simple headwear like bedazzled tiaras and golden headbands made their appearance alongside elaborate fascinators and massive hats. It\\'s clear that head coverings are key to the gilded glamour theme, and here are some of our favorite ones.Flaming DiscsGetty ImagesLa La Anthony arrived earlier in the night in a burgundy two-piece with a swirly manicure and a large red headpiece that captured our attention. On one side, there\\'s a large circular piece with red ovular pieces woven together. But, on the other side, the headpiece looks completely different — large and small candy apple-red roses shine, bringing this all-over red ensemble together.Hint of PinkGetty ImagesSarah Jessica Parker took our breaths away and clearly understood the gilded glamour assignment with her black-and-white Christopher John Roberts gown and detailed fascinator. This black netted piece covers part of her face, but it gets even better as your eyes travel up. Rolled pieces of black mesh pop out at the top alongside numerous strings with tiny diamond pieces in black and white. The fuchsia flower and leaves add a touch of color to this look that just makes sense.Abstract HaloGetty ImagesWinnie Harlow stepped on the carpet in a short abstract white dress topped with an intricate white-and-golden headpiece that we can\\'t quite describe. There\\'s thin golden rods that flow from the back of her head connecting to the clear-and-white, sharp abstract pieces that curl out from the sides of her head. This piece almost reminds us of the legs of an insect.Covered in SilverGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThis is far from the first headpiece Janelle Monáe has worn on the red carpet, and it won\\'t be the last one we ooooh and ahhhh over. The black-and-silver, striped hood connects to her bedazzled gown, which is the same color, and covers her entire head. It\\'s the epitome of glamour and excellence.Tiny TiarasGetty ImagesEmma Chamberlain was in the salon for hours the day before the Met Gala to achieve this light platinum blonde hair. Her blunt bob was parted down the middle and tucked behind her ears with a silver bedazzled tiara. This tiara isn\\'t in-your-face, but the delicate piece matches her studded accessories well.Pieces of GoldGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesTommy Dorfman made a statement with her hunter green, latex dress with black leather gloves. The small golden headband on her head complements the gold pieces on her cut-out dress. Tiny squarish shapes are all over the top of the headband.Birds of a Feather Getty ImagesQuannah Chasinghorse always brings her culture wherever she goes. For the Met Gala, she paired a large feather headpiece with a voluminous, baby blue tulle dress. The feathers were attached to intricate braids on one side of her head and look stunning with her jewelry.Bathed in WhiteGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesCynthia Erivo\\'s towering white headwrap references the Tignon Laws, which was a law in the late 1800s that forced Black women to cover their hair. The white wrap is also an ode to the many types of headwraps Black women wear around the globe. We\\'re loving the height and volume of this chalk-white headpiece.Wide BrimsGetty ImagesSZA was clearly embracing the saying \"go big or go home,\" with her hot pink gown, a massive black hat, and latex gloves and thigh-high boots. The sheer size of this hat was impressive, and we would love to know if it stayed put the whole night or if she had to take it off to avoid accidentally hitting someone. At the back of the hat is a fuzzy boa that reached below the singer\\'s waist.Sequins GaloreGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSequins and gems had a huge moment at the 2022 Met Gala. Jessica Chastain decided to shine in a long-sleeve, garnet gown with a silver snake that wrapped around the dress. She paired the look with a turban headband in the same red sequins as the dress for a matchy-matchy moment. The hair accessory also has a silver element with a jeweled brooch at the very center of her head — it\\'s lavish, glitzy, and flashy, which is apt for the glamourous theme.Netted VisionGetty ImagesClaire Danes\\'s slicked-back bob was accessorized with a black fascinator that covered most of her face and ears. This netted design was on the simpler side and almost looked like a bunch of small soda plastic rings woven together.One KnotGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesLily Aldridge is another celebrity who matched her entire outfit from head to toe. Her gown, gloves, and headscarf all had the same silver-studded black design. The bejeweled scarf was tied simply right below her neck for a chic but simple look.Golden GloryGetty ImagesNatasha Poonawalla did not skimp out on any gold on the red carpet. Her brown gown was covered in sequins and accessorized with several large gold pieces of jewelry. She even added a golden headband full of multicolored jewels in different sizes. But the main attraction was the golden corset-like piece that extends into a large headpiece. Three thin metal pieces formed a trio of circles around her head and neck, covering a portion of her face. Shorter pieces of gold curl outward on the rings matched the swirly metal on her chest area.With a TiltGetty ImagesMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNormani arrived in a velvet black two-piece set with a brand new hair color.

On June 15, the icon announced that her seventh album, titled Renaissance, is dropping on July 29. Even though she alerted her fans of the upcoming music a month in advance — a striking difference from when she released her self-titled album in 2013 without any promotion — she still made sure to keep us on our toes by sharing the exciting news in the middle of the night and appearing on the July cover of British Vogue just a few hours later.This cover is nothing short of magnificent — and the Beyhive agrees. The \"Spirit\" singer looks like royalty sitting on top of a horse in an all-black Maison Alaia gown with a massive feather headpiece. The rest of the photo shoot is just as breathtaking and extravagant. In one image, she appears in another black outfit but with a leather jacket, black box braids that hairstylist Jawara twisted into what looks like Bantu knots, and a glossy black lip, painted by her longtime makeup artist, Sir John. She looks like the baddest person to ever live sitting on top of a motorcycle instead of a horse.The hair and headpieces were clearly a focal priority in this shoot. They are striking, futuristic, and risky. In a few photos, she has dark hair instead of her usual blonde-highlighted strands, which is making some fans wonder if Queen Bey will be returning to her brunette era for this new album.Getty ImagesBut there is one other hairstyle that is sparking some strong reactions from the Beyhive. The hairstyle in question is the choppy baby fringe she wears with a gilded Schiaparelli Haute Couture outfit and jewelry. These short bangs are far from Beyonce\\'s norm and took several Twitter fans back to 2014, one of the few other times we have seen her with baby bangs.If you don\\'t remember that fringe, let me jog your memory for a second — they were thick, very blunt, and super short, stopping several inches about her forehead. She wore similar bangs in her \\'60s-inspired music video for \"Why Don\\'t You Love Me,\" which was released four years prior. She also had a pair of those stubby bangs in a brunette shade in her \"Telephone\" music video with pop star Lady Gaga.screenshot of Beyoncé from “Telephone” video\\nCourtesy of UMG/InterscopeA few fans noted how the resurgence of these bangs indicated that the Houston singer\\'s upcoming music is about to be epic.One user tweeted side-by-side photos of the spiky bangs and her baby fringe from 2014 and, \"Beyoncé is NOT playing she brought the choppy bangs out.\" Another fan compared the two photos and commented, \"Beyoncé even resurrected the chopped and screwed bangs. Act 1 taking no prisoners boyyyyy.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesNot everyone was enthused about her short bangs, though. \"Not the jagged bangs, Beyoncé, anything but that,\" one user tweeted in all caps. Another jokingly noted that the fringe was probably styled by one of her five-year-old twins. \"I love that Beyoncé always includes her kids in her work, the fact that she got rumi and sir to cut her bangs/style her hair,\" the tweet reads.Regardless of your feelings about the baby fringe, we\\'re sure you\\'re more than excited for the upcoming album — we definitely are. Some fans are thinking it\\'s going to include disco and house influences due to rumors about artists she is collaborating with and the overall vibe of the shoot; it blends retro elements, such as a giant disco ball and platform boots, and futuristic designs. We won\\'t fully know until July 29, but we\\'re sure that Beyoncé will deliver hits as she always has.Read more stories about bangs:21 Types of Bangs to Consider If You\\'re Ready to Take the PlungeBottleneck Bangs Are the New, Daintier Take on Curtain BangsYour Guide to Styling, Maintaining, and Growing Out Curtain BangsNow enjoy this pro-dancers entire daily routine:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'In our humble opinion, nothing beats the rush of getting a needle poked through your skin for a piercing. Among the various ways to express yourself through body modification, they\\'re relatively low risk and just plain ol\\' fun.Piercing trends tend to ebb and flow. Some locations, like the ear lobe, seemingly never go out of style while other placements, like the belly button, resurge in popularity every few years or so. The COVID-19 pandemic affected many folks\\' ability to get piercings as mask-covered areas became off-limits. But, as tattoo and piercing shops open back up, more people have been willing to experiment, whether it\\'s by adding new jewelry to old holes or getting something entirely new.We chatted with a few piercers to learn about all the ear and body piercing trends you should expect in the new year. Here are the piercing trends you\\'ll be seeing everywhere in 2022.Ear CurationsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyThe ear is a popular site for piercings, but recently more folks are seeking out ear curations, according to piercer Amber Maysonet who works at Live by the Sword Tattoo. \"It\\'s basically a mapping and planning for either now or future piercings for your ears,\" she explains. Ear curations involve giving the piercer the creative freedom to choose multiple piercings for you while taking into account your aesthetic and your ear\\'s anatomy to figure out the best placements and jewelry. Sometimes these curations also involve adding new jewelry to already existing piercings to ensure everything works together.Maysonet cites social media, especially TikTok, as the reason why she thinks more people are choosing these curations. \"When you look at [these piercings], especially on social media, you see how good everything goes together and how nice [they] look on somebody else, obviously you\\'re like, \\'OMG, I can do that,\\'\" she shares.At Brooklyn\\'s So Gold Studies, piercer and founder Cassi Lopez-March requires that clients have at least three existing piercings and be willing to get one to three additional piercings during an ear curation session. She finds that more of her clients are seeking out \"full-blown ear styling\" rather than coming in with pre-determined placements because the average person does not always know what they want. \"When someone gives us free reign to kind of have fun with it, that\\'s when the magic happens,\" she shares.OrbitalsCourtesy of Instagram/@cassisoclassyIf you google \"orbital piercing,\" you\\'ll see a couple of different piercing locations, but don\\'t let the internet confuse you, Cassi Lopez-March says. \"An actual orbital is just one ring that connects two holes,\" she explains. You can get two new piercings or use new jewelry to connect older ones. She has noticed this placement becoming extremely popular with clients who want to refresh their old holes and give them a new life. At her shop, they tend to add orbitals to the lobe area to connect second or even third piercings.NavalCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2017, I fulfilled one of my childhood dreams of getting a belly button piercing. I remember a friend of mine was a bit shocked that I chose the location given that it was no longer \"popular.\" But it looks like I may have been ahead of the curve (and honestly, I don\\'t make my decisions on trends alone) because both Maysonet and Lopez-March see a resurgence in belly rings coming soon.Just like fashion and beauty trends, nostalgia is winning once again with piercings, seeing as belly rings had their last heyday in the 2000s. But Maysonet has seen folks adding a bit of a twist to the placement by getting both the top and bottom of their bellies pierced rather than choosing just one or the other.Flat HelixCourtesy of Instagram/@studsFolks are becoming more interested in receiving multiple piercings at once rather than just one. \"Right now, I think the piercing trends of 2022 are being influenced by the excitement and relief of returning to travel, celebrations, and concerts with new trends of bold self-expression,\" Lisa Bubbers, co-founder of piercing studio Studs where they focus exclusively on ear piercings, shares. That\\'s why she predicts that a trio of piercings on the flat helix will be big in the new year.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe flat helix is specifically the flat area of cartilage located in the upper ear. Bubbers says it\\'s a great spot because you can try out a few different types of jewelry options and have fun with customization. She\\'s also noticed an increase in asymmetrical placements, which can be done in this area.EyebrowGetty ImagesRecently, we\\'ve noticed certain celebrities with new eyebrow piercings — some fake, some real. On September 27, Lil Nas X showed off his new eyebrow piercing on TikTok to fans\\' praise. (Since then we haven\\'t really seen it make another appearance, so who knows if the jewelry was just a fake-out.)Cardi B debuted her own eyebrow piercing during Paris Fashion Week in one of the best ways possible. She showed out in an extravagant red Mugler dress and cape with bedazzled red brows and a silver ring through her left eyebrow. The eyebrow was a popular piercing location in the \\'90s and 2000s, and it seems like it will be reentering the mainstream in 2022.Snakebites/StacksCourtesy of Instagram/@ileanastabbedmeMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesIn 2019, Studs created their signature \"Snakebite\" piercing, which model Kaia Gerber helped make popular. The name may be a bit confusing if you\\'re used to the Snakebite lip piercing — which typically means two piercings spaced out at each outer corner of the lower lip — but this is an ear piercing that involves stacking two holes close together on the outer cartilage of the mid-ear area. Bubbers says they expect to see folks trying the piercing in new places like the Forward Helix and Conch in 2022.The jewelry in these holes is just as important as the piercings themselves. Scrolling through Studs\\'s Instagram, you\\'ll see ears full of these Snakebite piercings with gold and silver jewelry in all shapes and sizes.NosesCourtesy of Instagram/@tinyneedleznycMaysonet has also seen an increase in nose piercings, both on the nostril and the septum. She cites the resurgence of punk, alternative, and even scene aesthetics as the impetus for this rise. We\\'re also willing to bet that once mask mandates are lifted in certain areas that it will allow more people to finally try the piercing placement.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesYou can get a simple septum or nostril piercing or go all out and try two piercings, whether that be with one hole in each nostril, two holes in one nostril, or a septum and nostril piercing. It\\'s up to you to decide what kind of fun you\\'re into.With the unpredictability of the past two years, there\\'s truly no knowing what will happen in the piercing world. But we are sure that more and more folks will continue to dip into creativity and give their piercer freedom to guide them along their piercing journey.Read more stories about body modification:Contraconch Piercings Are Gaining Popularity For Their Unexpected PlacementYour Complete Guide to Vulva PiercingsHow Your Belly Button Piercing Changes When You Get PregnantNow watch 100 years of piercings:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'It almost felt like the MTV VMAs were back to their pre-pandemic form tonight at the 2022 show.

In addition to these three celebs, Lizzo, Bad Bunny, and Anitta all blessed the stage with their voices.The performances were amazing, and our eyes were zoned in on what these stars were wearing from head to toe, both on and off the stage. They were already wowing us with their massive feather headpieces, face jewelry, and slicked-back hair, but we were also obsessing over all the manicures. Here are just a few that we are loving.Dove CameronGetty ImagesDove Cameron went for dark grunge vibes at the awards show. She paired her strapless leather and floral gown with smoked-out burgundy eye makeup, plum glossy lips, and stiletto-shaped nails.

For example, there were deep red rose charms and silver gems on each middle finger. If you look closely, you might have noticed the black scissor decals on each ring fingernail.Betty WhoGetty ImagesThe Australian-born singer-songwriter showed up with black-and-white graphic nails. Each hand had different nail designs. On one hand, there were various sizes of white and black stars on each nail. The other hand had white hearts on the index and ring fingers. The white design on the middle finger was actually an ode to the awards show; it\\'s the iconic MTV logo.Monét X ChangeGetty ImagesMonét X Change had already caught over eyes with her large afro puffs and bright tropical-inspired makeup, but we made sure not to forget her white swirly tips.

The medium-length, almond-shaped nails were full of sparkly gems and jewels.Lil Nas XGetty ImagesNow, hearing the words \"goth Big Bird\" probably sounds like the strangest and worst thing in the world, but we swear Lil Nas X\\'s VMAs outfit will make you rethink that. The rapper showed out with a massive black feather headpiece with matching pants. It\\'s hard to take your eyes off this elaborate feather piece, but the mismatched manicure he wore that night also deserves some fanfare.OPI Nail Lacquer in Bubble Bath$11OPI Nail Lacquer in Black Onyx$11Two nails on each hand were painted completely black by nail artist Temeka Jackson who used OPI GelColor polishes, which are exclusively available to nail artists, to complete this look. Thankfully, the two shades she used, Bubble Bath (pale pink) and Black Onyx (pitch black), are available in nail lacquer form, so this look can be recreated at home.

The different clips stitched together show the model in a pink velvet bathing suit (ah, a true sign of an L.A. winter) with frosty pink eye makeup and matching pink butterfly clips pulling her hair back from her face.\"Todays vibe,\" the nonchalant caption reads, along with a couple of emojis. Throughout the video, Bieber smiles and makes duck faces while she shows off her look. Her hair is middle-parted and styled with natural beach waves and baby braids. As for makeup, she\\'s opted for layered pink eye shadow: a lighter shade on her inner lids, and a darker hue on her outer lids. Pink glitter serves as her eyeliner, which rims both lash lines and extends outward into a baby wing. The monochromatic look also features a rosy blush, a pink lip color, and soft highlighter on her cheek bones.

On February 23, Variety revealed its latest cover, which features the \"Truth Hurts\" singer in full-blown 1920s flapper garb including a pixie haircut, art deco jewelry, and a metallic silver shift dress. You can read the accompanying interview and see more photos over at .The real star of the whole shoot, though — at least, if you ask us — is her makeup. You can get a closer look at it right here. For the cover, Alexx Mayo (Lizzo\\'s right-hand makeup artist) created a fittingly retro face complete with a defined Cupid\\'s bow and mint-colored eye shadow that reaches from her lash line all the way up to her eyebrows. Now, those eyebrows. Let\\'s talk about them.If you were born in a certain decade, you might be getting overplucking flashbacks from the razor-thin size, high placement, and rounded arches of these eyebrows — but like it or not, that\\'s about to be very en vogue. Not only are 1920s beauty trends making the rounds on TikTok right now, but thin, arched eyebrows are all over runways, too.AB+DM for VarietyNobody has the time to achieve this look for everyday wear, but if you want to play around with a similar brow shape, take a page from Joey Healy, who previously told Allure to “take a glue stick, warm it up, and carefully run it across the brow. What this does is take away the texture of the brow and flatten it.” Set it with a few layers of powder and foundation, and you\\'re set. \"Now you can have fun on top of that canvas; I personally like to use a pomade and a brow brush to draw on that thin brow,\" Healy said.

Follow Nicola on Instagram.', 'In a world where affordable “dupes” constantly go viral, is there really a difference when it comes to luxury makeup? Anyone who’s ever cracked open a Tom Ford eye shadow palette or swiped on a Valentino lipstick will tell you: You definitely feel the difference with a premium beauty product. There’s undeniable appeal in experiencing it, from the high-end, thoughtful packaging, to the long-lasting, super-luxe formulas, and, of course, the thrill of a designer purchase — without having to spend a fortune on a single item of clothing. You’re applying products to your face every day, so why not make the investment?Experts agree high-end products stand out. “As a dermatologist, I like for the ingredients and studies/results to inform my opinion about a product’s performance,” says Karen Kagha, MD, a Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist. “Combining that with great branding, as many luxury brand names have done for years, is the best of both worlds.”Another bonus? Formulas from luxury makeup brands have also become more advanced than ever. According to cosmetic chemist and licensed aesthetician Esther Olu, the increased popularity of skin care post-2020 has led to more makeup brands prioritizing the creation of skin-care-infused formulas. Think: Foundations with ingredients you’d find in a serum (like niacinamide, vitamin C, and hyaluronic acid), or concealers with peptides and caffeine you’d expect in an eye cream. “Consumers want a natural, skin-like finish while simultaneously taking care of their skin — without looking like they have makeup on,” she says. “That is how hybrid formulations have begun and since grown.”Given the rise in interest for higher-end products, we rounded up some luxury favorites at Sephora definitely worth their price tags:Westman Atelier Vital Skincare Dewy Foundation DropsThe latest from makeup artist Gucci Westman’s cosmetics line is like a serum and foundation wrapped in one. It contains tsubaki oil, which aids skin with hydration according to Olu. As for application, Soriano says fingertips are best. Target any red areas on the face first and then apply to the rest of the face. “Use the middle and ring finger as it gives great control,” she says. “The warmth in your hands will melt the makeup into the skin, giving it a natural ‘dewy’ appearance.”Yves Saint Laurent Nu Bare Look Hydrating Skin Tint FoundationIf you’re looking for dewy skin, here’s your new favorite foundation. It’s ideal for day-to-day light to medium coverage and feels more like a moisturizer, thanks to hydrating hyaluronic acid and glycerin in its formula. “These ingredients are essentially attracting, binding, and holding water into the skin,” Olu says. “As a result of using these ingredients in foundations, it gives the skin a more hydrated, plump, and softer look.”Gucci Blush de Beauté Powder BlushThis new blush – Gucci’s first powder blush – blends like a dream. With a matte finish, it achieves the natural-looking rosiness you’d get after receiving a compliment. “A great place to add cheek color is on the cheek bone,” Soriano says. “It’s just below the outer corner of the eye. It frames the eyes and lifts the face.” She also suggests using a blush-specific brush for application (her favorite is the Sephora Collection Pro Blush Brush #93).Valentino Rosso Valentino Refillable LipstickBehold, your forever tube of lipstick. The sleek red-and-gold logo-embellished case alone is worthy of a splurge, but the swappable shades (pick from 50) really seal the deal. Soriano calls the lipstick “pure luxury” and suggests the hue ‘Blushing Nude’ for fall. “It’s a great neutral color for a lot of skin tones, and can be elevated with a lip liner or one of satin finishes on top,” she says.Armani Beauty Luminous Silk FoundationArmani’s Best of Beauty-winning foundation needs no introduction – it’s achieved fan-favorite status for its skin-like, glowy finish. You get full coverage without the weight, thanks to an oil-free formula. “Having an oil-free foundation may help improve sensory experience,” Olu says, citing a less greasy texture and appearance.Hourglass Vanish Airbrush ConcealerLike the “Paris” Instagram filter in real life, this concealer gives your skin a soft-focus finish. The full-coverage, waterproof formula contains microspherical powders, which Olu explains are like tiny hollow beads. “Microspheres possess light-reflecting benefits, which give a temporary wrinkle-filling, optical blurring effect,” she says. “Because of this light-reflecting property, this allows microspheres to even out skin tone and minimize the appearance of fine lines.”Tom Ford Eye Color Quad Eyeshadow PaletteIf there’s only one eye shadow palette you ever use, this is it. Create a range of eye looks – from subtle to dramatic – with just four shades. The shadows are incomparable for their blendability and crease-poof, long-lasting finish. As for application, Soriano suggests to “work your way from light to dark, and from flat to shine.” For a smokey eye, use the darkest color over the lid and below the lash line. “Add your highlight colors to the inner corner and browline as the high-shine color in the center of the eye,” Soriano explains.Dior Forever Skin Glow FoundationLooking for a longwear foundation? This heat- and humidity-resistant foundation won’t budge all day. Soriano suggests using a sponge blender or wedge for best application. “This type of foundation is buildable, so depending on the finish you want, you can add layers slowly for a more long-lasting wear,” she says, “But, at the same time, still having that natural glow.”Pat McGrath Labs Mothership X Eyeshadow Palette: Moonlit SeductionPat McGrath is a master of pigments, and this 10-shade palette is packed with them. You get one-swipe color payoff, velvety blending, and no creasing with this mix of mattes and metallics. From holographic lavender glitter to everyday taupe, the combinations are endless. It also comes packaged beautifully in a case that puts each shade on display like jewelry.Yves Saint Laurent Rouge Pur Couture The Bold High Pigment LipstickHere’s a tube you’ll gladly pull out of your purse for reapplication, just because of its stylish design. The black-and-gold, logo-emblazoned lipstick also boasts highly pigmented, satin-finish colors while grape oil helps moisturize lips for a comfortable wear. “Go bold and wear a statement color,” Soriano advises. “My standout favorite is 1971 Rouge Provocation.It’s gorgeous, luxurious, and one of those amazing pigments that will suit so many skin complexions.”Dior Lip Glow OilThere’s a reason this Allure Best of Beauty winner keeps selling out. The plush formula, boosted with antioxidant-rich cherry oil, doubles as a treatment and a gloss that adjusts to your pH to create a flattering, custom shade. Makeup artist Nina Soriano is a “huge fan” of this non-sticky gloss. “It’s a wonderful hybrid of lip stain and lip shine in one,” she says. “My standout favorites are ‘Rosewood’ and ‘Mahogany.’ Both colors are great for that natural lip color.’”', \"Right before Christmas 2021, Saweetie shocked fans with a bleach-blonde buzz cut. Since then, the California rapper's lengthy wigs have been nowhere to be seen. She's been giving her buzz cut the press tour it truly deserves, but it seems the hair changes aren't done because the star's blonde buzz cut is now a bright pink color.Saweetie's new hair color was revealed in an Instagram carousel she posted to celebrate her new collaboration with MAC. In the first picture, she is sitting on a table in a black silk dress and robe with lace gloves, grape-colored thigh-high boots, and silver jewelry. You can't miss the bold pink color on her head. It's not quite bright enough to be considered neon, nor is it light enough to be a pastel color. We'd call it bubblegum pink.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.In the beginning of 2020, it was clear that pink had become the it color for hair. We saw celebrities like Ciara and Jennifer Lopez jump on the trend and try the bright hue. Perhaps they inspired Saweetie to try the color, or maybe she wanted to try it just because? She's not exactly new to the world of bright hair. Though she looked great as a blonde, this color change gives her short cut a fresh new look. We wonder whether this color will be short-lived or if it will become the star's new signature shade. Regardless, we're here for it all. But if she is planning to change the color anytime soon, we'd love to see a cool cobalt blue on her head.Read more stories about short hair:50 Short Haircuts and Hairstyles to Inspire Your New LookHow to Cut Your Short Hair at Home, According to ExpertsThe '90s Bixie — a Hybrid of a Bob and a Pixie — Is Back and It's the Short Hairstyle of 2022Now enjoy YouTuber Pony Park's quick makeup routine:Don't forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.\", 'The Holiday 2022 season is officially upon us, which means we have lots of present shopping to get done. While our friends and loved ones deserve gifts along the line of private yacht rentals and jewelry adorned with carats on carats of gold, our budgets tend to present restrictions. However, thanks to the power of the Internet (and a little e-retailer called Amazon), it\\'s relatively easy to gift our parents, siblings, and best friends thoughtful presents that won\\'t break the bank. Case in point: the below Amazon finds don\\'t cost a penny over $25.Cryotherapy facials are, for example, a service that could run well into the hundreds of dollars for a single session, but a reusable ice roller can encourage similar results for only $8. Hand-poured artisanal candles from Paddywax, available in unique scent combinations like Chamomile and Fig or Sea Salt and Sage and packaged in stunning amber vessels, feel far more decadent than their $25 price tag. Touchland\\'s rosewater hand sanitizer is a far cry from the drugstore variety that\\'s become a permanent fixture in their tote bag, making it a useful gift that delivers a touch of luxury to daily life. And silk pillowcases? There can be no greater joy than resting their heads on a cool-to-the-touch pillow that won\\'t tangle hair or cause facial creasing.If you\\'re struggling to check everyone off your list without sacrificing your savings, we\\'ve rounded up the best under-$25 gift ideas from Amazon.

Utilize both in your wind-down routine for the most luxurious, relaxing vibes.FaceTory\\'s Lip Sleeping Mask contains jojoba seed oil and shea butter to soften and soothe, but the hero ingredient in this product is strawberry fruit extract — an antioxidant-rich superstar that also increases radiance.

Just like her debut cover, she\\'s once again posing in front of a blue background with her name in all caps (as it should be).A constant trendsetter of the era, Dobson\\'s hair was short and curly on the first album cover, whereas now, it\\'s styled as a straight mullet, and she\\'s proving that she can keep up with the times faster than we can. The most important part, however, is her makeup — she rocked a frosty blue smoky with a glossy lip on her first album cover. Now, she\\'s wearing a vivid, vinyl blue eye shadow covering her entire lids, hopefully foreshadowing the power of her single to come, while her lip look remains more or less the same.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Her fit? She\\'s in a leather jacket with a gray T-shirt underneath, jeans, and a few layered necklaces, whereas her debut album features a staple early-2000s look: a white cami with red bra straps showing, low-rise jeans with a belt chain, and chunky silver jewelry.\"New single FCKN IN LOVE out 2.25.22,\" she wrote as the caption. It seems more than a few are psyched about her return, as the comments section is filled with clapping emojis and quite a few \"YASS\"es.

But as lovely as both of their manicures may be in their latest nailfie, it\\'s their lavish matching jewelry that\\'s commanding the most attention.On Tuesday, November 2, Jenner posted of her own and Stormi\\'s left hands with the caption \"Daddy got us matching rings \\U0001f90d⛈.\" She\\'s referring to the sparklers on her pointer finger and Stormi\\'s ring finger, gifted by Travis Scott. The toi et moi rings each feature two different diamond cuts — a pear shape and rectangular radiant cut — with Jenner\\'s being quite a bit larger than Stormi\\'s.

But yesterday brought good news! No, still no word on the new season — but one of its biggest stars, Evan Rachel Wood, has been keeping busy doing something extremely awesome: looking exactly like Madonna.Wood posted a photo of herself to Instagram on Wednesday, March 2, in which she\\'s dressed and made up to uncannily resemble Madonna circa 1984. The still is from Roku\\'s upcoming Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, a film about \"Weird Al\" Yankovic\\'s unusual and award-winning career, starring Daniel Radcliffe as the curly-haired king of parody songs. As those of us who lived through the ‘80s will recall, one of Yankovic’s biggest hits, \"Like a Surgeon,\" was based on Madonna\\'s \"Like a Virgin.\" (In fact, legend has it that it was actually Madonna\\'s idea.) So it makes perfect sense that she\\'d make an appearance in the biopic — and now that I see Wood\\'s photo, it makes perfect sense that she\\'d play her. With the help of makeup, hair, and wardrobe, the likeness is undeniable.\"The secret\\'s out!\" Wood wrote in the caption of the still, which shows her in a black and white, lacy, jewelry-heavy getup true to Madonna\\'s style at the time. Her dirty-blonde hair with dark roots is topped with a tulle headband. \"I am having WAY TOO MUCH FUN playing the iconic Madonna in @therokuchannel\\'s WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story with Daniel Radcliffe. ✨🙌🏻🙌🏻😱😱💋\"Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Allure reached out to the film\\'s talented makeup artist, Kat Bardot, who\\'s not yet at liberty to give details about the production\\'s star-transforming process. But what we can tell from the additional closeup she posted to Instagram of Wood is that she precisely shaped Wood\\'s lip line to look more like Madonna\\'s mouth, filling in with a glossy berry red shade. Wood\\'s eyes are fully lined with black pencil, and she\\'s wearing golden yellow and coppery brown shadow on her mobile lid and crease respectively. Her brows are perfectly fluffed, her cheeks are host to a bright pink blush, and of course, there\\'s a little dot next to her philtrum to represent Madonna\\'s beauty mark.In the caption, Bardot says this is \"one of a handful of looks\" she created for Wood as Madonna and that working with the actor \"has been an absolute joy.\" So I definitely can\\'t wait to see the other Madonna looks — not to mention how Radcliffe looks as Yankovic — when the movie premieres.

It is this same scarcity that has been the catalyst for change across various industries, with members of the Black community leading the charge. In the art world, 26-year-old sculptor Murjoni Merriweather is one of many addressing this grave imbalance. Her art, crafted from colorful braids, adorned with massive hoop earrings, and sometimes flourished with gold teeth, is the ultimate celebration of Black beauty.Merriweather\\'s work has built her a social media following about 43,000 strong on Instagram, where she goes by @mvrjoni. But before she became Instafamous (or anyone had even heard of the platform), Merriweather tells me on a Zoom call, she was just an art-loving second-grader doodling in her sketchbooks during class. An eighth-grade ceramics class got her interested in working with clay, though she wasn\\'t necessarily feeling it at first. \"I told my teacher, \\'I don\\'t like the [pottery] wheel. Can we do something else?\\',\" she recalls. That \"something else\" still involved clay but instead of making cups and bowls, Merriweather\\'s teacher encouraged her to focus on sculping.J A Z E L L E and A D H A R A\\nCourtesy of Murjoni MerriweatherAs Merriweather\\'s knowledge of art deepened, she started to notice a trend. Several class trips to museums revealed a marked lack of pieces that humanized Black people. It made her want to create art that is more true to the Black American experience. \"That\\'s what my work is about, a celebration of our culture in different parts of [the United States],\" she shares. But it wasn\\'t until college that Merriweather started producing the sculptures she\\'s known for. In 2014, she started at the Maryland Institute of Art where she majored in ceramics with a concentration in film and video. Her studies allowed her to dive deeper into her artistry and focus on portrait sculptures. The very first and one of her most notable pieces, known as S E E M E, was a class project she did in 2016.S E E M ES E E M E\\nCourtesy of Murjoni MerriweatherS E E M E depicts a Black man with a crop of short locs. His fingers pull at either side of his mouth to expose the grill on his bottom teeth and a single gold tooth on top. Merriweather wanted to highlight teeth jewelry, popular in many Black communities across the United States and other parts of the world. As with many aesthetic choices born in Black communities, they\\'re often seen as de classé at first — that is, until someone non-Black decides to adopt the trend. \"If somebody else wears [grills], it\\'s like, \\'Oh this is fashion,\\'\" Merriweather says. The piece aims to subvert the negative connotations associated with grills: \"I [sculpted his hands this way] because I feel like it\\'s a common pose that Black people do to proudly show off our grills,\" she explains. \"I wanted him to fit the stereotype of a \\'scary\\' Black man. He\\'s pulling his teeth apart [because] I want you to focus on what\\'s on his insides, rather judge him for his outside.\" S E E M E would up being the first piece in Merriweather\\'s beloved Grillz Collection, which launched in 2016.Merriweather is intentional about how she makes each piece, from the actual sculpting to the naming process. Each bust is given a name that is written in all caps with a space between each letter. \"I want people to actually sit with the name, take time with it, understand it, and respect it,\" she shares. Merriweather\\'s pieces were made to take up space — they are normally anywhere from 20 to 24 inches high, though the smallest ones can be eight to 12 inches and the larger ones are around 40 inches tall. She typically produces her work in bunches of three to five at a time, so it can take a month or two to complete if she\\'s going quickly. Merriweather needs about a week to sculpt before she fires the piece (which can take a few days) to preserve its form.Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesPolaroid of Murjoni Merriweather and artist Pink Siifu with the sculpture she made inspired by him, P I N K S I I F U\\nPhotographed by Marqel Allen/Courtesy of Murjoni MerriweatherThe Braided CollectionBefore she even touches the clay, Merriweather finds a muse, sometimes among her family and friends.

Other times, she\\'ll see someone with an interesting facial feature or hairstyle out in public that she must recreate with clay. She\\'ll get ideas from social media, too — those go in an Instagram folder. \"If I take a lot of inspiration from one person, I\\'ll name the sculpture after them,\" she says. \"A lot of my sculptures\\' names come from the actual people they were inspired by.\"D E N I C I A and K A M I L\\nCourtesy of Murjoni MerriweatherMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSuch is the case for a bust crafted from slime-green braids called K A M I L, which Merriweather made after seeing a photo of Kamil Oshundara on her Instagram Discover page. In the image that caught her attention, Oshundara\\'s kinky, neon-green was hair twisted into Bantu knots that Merriweather felt compelled to recreate. The result is a 35-inch masterpiece covered in multi-tonal neon green plaits the artist braided and dyed herself. She added a septum ring and a smattering of piercings to the statue\\'s ears to match Oshundara\\'s own. The sculpture, which appeared in the Shattered Glass show at the Jeffrey Deitch Gallery in Los Angeles, is one of Merriweather\\'s creations that has received the most recognition.K A M I L and D E N I C I A are two of many pieces part of the artist\\'s Braided Collection, which she first started working on in 2016. The series seeks to honor the diversity of Black hairstyles, using kanekalon braiding hair as its medium. The process is simple: she molds the clay, then attaches braids dyed in vivid rainbow hues like pink or orange to it. Merriweather is keen on emphasizing that each plait is done by hand to call attention to the time and care put into these hairstyles. \"The action of braiding reminds me of the work my mom put into my hair,\" she says, noting that she sometimes taps her mother or a friend to help her with the braids. \"A lot of Black women and even Black men have [a similar] upbringing of getting our hair done. That itself is a part of Black culture.\"Though Merriweather\\'s artwork affirms Black beauty, she admits that she struggled with loving herself. It felt almost contradictory for her to be making artwork about self-love as she wrestled with the concept. \"How can I tell someone to love themselves if I\\'m struggling to do that?\" she shares. Those feelings inspired her to create the S H I N I N \\' series in 2021.S H I N I N \\'S H I N I N \\' and E L A R A\\nCourtesy of Murjoni MerriweatherMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe name of this collection serves as a reminder that \"you can shine through anything, basically,\" Merriweather says. Each work is quite appropriately covered in glitter, partly a result of experimentation that started in 2016. The initial piece, which bears the name of the series, was covered in black glitter… and after some time, shattered. She placed it in a bin and didn\\'t look at it again until 2021 — the broken shards of the project inspired her to give it another go. If you ask some of her fans, the sculpture bears a strong resemblance to Merriweather: the person has a shaved head and a gap between their top front teeth. But any similarities, she says, are purely coincidental. Other pieces in the series are adorned with some of the obvious trappings of the modern Black American aesthetic: large hoop earrings and long fluttery lashes.The profundity of Merriweather\\'s sculptures lies not just in their beauty, but the feeling of familiarity they invoke. All the details, like the textured hairstyles, jewelry, and glossy lips, are inspired by Black people you may know: The lady you always run into buying hoop earrings at the Beauty Supply shop; the homegirl you bumped into on the subway; your uncle who always mans the grill at family cookouts. \"[I want] to immortalize each and every one of us,\" Merriweather says. It\\'s an undertaking she\\'ll be working on for a lifetime and then some, but she\\'s committed to the task.Read more stories about Black hair:The Makings of a Black Hair DesertNikki Nelms Creates Head-Turning Natural Hairstyles That Scream \\'Go Big or Go Home\\'It\\'s Time for Fluffy \"Cloud Hair\" to Have Its MomentNow enjoy our March 2022 cover star, Amanda Gorman, sharing her beauty favorites:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'Sylvie Macmillan is a member of The A List, which honors individuals who are driving and shaping the future of beauty.Sylvie Macmillan has pushed the boundaries of nail art, and we mean that literally.

Thanks, Dior, for healing our inner child with this look.Dries Van Noten: Black EyelinerGettyCall it the Julia Fox effect: we consider this thick black eyeliner seen on Dries Van Noten\\'s runway very muse-worthy, indeed.Koche: Bleached BuzzGettyBleached hair — and sometimes eyebrows — have been all over runways this season, and Koche\\'s is no exception.EENK: Copper HairGettyMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesEENK is both the name of a designer and the noise I made when I saw this perfect copper hair look walk down the runway. We\\'ve said it before, and we\\'ll scream it again: this is the color of 2022.Saint Laurent: Slicked-BackGettyIt would not be fashion week — or a Saint Laurent runway, either — without some slicked-back, face lift-giving ponytails.Vaquera: Metallic LipstickGettyMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSure, we\\'ve seen our fair share of power red lipsticks this fashion month, but we love that designers have also played with other bolds like black and metallics. At Vaquera, this model got the matchy-matchy treatment with silver lips and eyes.Anna Isabella: Glitter EyeGettyNormally shiny under-eyes are the result of a harsh flash, but we love Anna Isabella\\'s take on the look: a little ethereal, a little extraterrestrial, but totally fabulous.Dawei: Slick PixiesGettyMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesThe breeziness of a pixie has that very French je ne sais quoi quality about it, and this one on the Dawai runway is no exception. And if you stare at it long enough, you just might decide to chop off all your hair. We\\'re certainly considering it!Rochas: Crimson LipstickGettyWhen it comes to chilly fall days, your lips need two things: a good, hydrating balm to soothe wind-chapped lips, and a rich, deep hued red lipstick to pumpkin spice things up. It\\'s a rule the Rochas runway abided by well, sending this model out in a juicy oxblood shade.Balmain: CherGettyMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOK, sure, \"Cher\" isn\\'t a trend. But as the French (and us when we\\'re feeling fancy) say, Cher will always be iconique. The stick-straight black hair, the glamorous, often metallic makeup: she will always be a muse. So it makes sense that Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing would want to close out his show by walking alongside her.Chloe: Metallic Cat EyeGettyThe vibe is disco drama at Chloe. We love the model\\'s curly bangs and over-gown shag — and that metallic winged eye look is a chrome cherry on top.Acne Studios: Hair AccentsGettyMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesFact: bows will always be the cutest, most nostalgic hair trend you can go for. So we love this take on the look at Acne Studios runway: the model\\'s braids were fastened into a little bow adornment.Rick Owens: Blue GlazeGettyOn the Rick Owens runway, we learn how to color hair without making it a whole thing. Blink — or chalk it up to a reflection on the model\\'s glossy hair — and you\\'ll miss the blue glaze that adorns her crown.Off-White: Purple Cat EyeGettyMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesA look Prince would approve of, this sultry purple cat eye was seen on the Off-White runway. We can think of nothing more weird — and weird is a good thing, people! — than this paired with the model\\'s extra-long collar.Messika: Septum PiercingsGettyWhen you\\'re a Messika jewelry model like Cindy Bruna, wearing thousands of dollars worth of carats — all at once — is part of the job. The look is so shiny, in fact, that you might miss the dainty septum piercing… but we didn\\'t.Isabel Marant: Lived-in BlondeGettyMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSometimes, a too-perfect dye job takes away some of the fun. That\\'s why we\\'re digging Gigi Hadid\\'s look on the Isabel Marant runway. It looks like the model\\'s actually lived her life in this hair color, letting her roots show and working with, instead of against, a little bit of frizz. That\\'s a low maintenance trend we can champion.Ann Demeulemeester: Smudged EyesGettyDesigner Ann Demeulemeester is well-known for her smart, deconstructed suiting, and that look has moved north to her models\\' eyes. Purposeful smudging is certainly a beauty choice, and here it compliments an otherwise bare-looking face.Givenchy: The Bumpit ReturnsGettyMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesOK, so Givenchy models certainly didn\\'t go down the runway wearing bumpits (you know, the Y2K must-have that allows for some volume at the crown of your head). But the slicked-back look isn\\'t that far from 2006\\'s fetch-est going out hairstyle: the poof.L\\'Oréal: Gilded EyelinerGettyWhen a makeup brand like L\\'Oréal has a runway show, you\\'re bound to see some exquisite beauty looks — and this one didn\\'t disappoint. This gilded eye outline belongs in the Louvre.Valentino: Yellow BlondeGettyMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesAn icy-white blonde is fun and all that, but sometimes it\\'s nice to let hair dye do its thing (that is: fade). This Valentino look follows the punk ethos that not every dye job needs to be crisp and perfect. It\\'s Debbie Harry-esque perfection.Thom Browne: KidcoreGettyThe TikTok-approved kidcore trend hit Thom Browne\\'s runway in spectacular fashion. Where do we begin? The painted-on gold eyebrows, the lilac highlighter, or the metallic green lipstick? It\\'s all too good to pick just one.Comme des Garçons: Sculptural BeautyGettyMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesParis runways always bring out the true artistry that fuels fashion. The Comme des Garçons runway exemplified this, as models walked wearing elaborate wigs and hair sculptures. How you manage to strut with your vision being blocked by a gigantic bird cage is a mystery to us all, but proves once again that models are elite athletes — and should be respected as such!Miu Miu: Side-Parted Slicked PixieGettyMiu Miu is well-loved for its geek-chic stylings. As a former middle school geek (and current mid-20s geek), I could only wish to emulate the cerebral coolness found in this side-parted slicked pixie.Chanel: Plum LipstickGettyMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesYeah, yeah, it\\'s the season for black lipstick, and that\\'s all fine and good. But sometimes you want another deeply-hued option, and this glossy plum lip seen on Chanel\\'s runway fits the bill.Louis Vuitton: Coral GlossGettyIt\\'s very French to just throw on a lip gloss and go enjoy your day (I say this as someone who\\'s only time in France was spent during a four-hour layover in Charles de Gaulle airport). But seriously: this breezy coral lip gloss seen on Louis Vuitton\\'s runway is the perfect \"I-need-something-but-not-a-lot\" makeup.Zimmermann: Curly ShagGettyMost Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesParis Fashion Week is where good hair days go to party, and this curly shag seen on Zimmermann\\'s runway is perhaps the best example. It\\'s so bouncy, and so ‘80s, and we\\'ll be dreaming of it all fall long.Read more about beauty trends: I\\'m Officially Over Nostalgic Beauty TrendsWe\\'re Calling It Now: These Are the Biggest Beauty Trends of 2022Behold, the Coolest Fall Makeup Trends All in One PlaceAnd now, watch our October cover star Quannah Chasinghorse get ready in 10-minutes:Don\\'t forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.', 'In Alice in Wonderland, Alice embarks on a psychedelic journey. But you don\\'t have to go down a literal rabbit hole to find inspiration for kidcore, the trippy beauty look that uses big, bold strokes and vivid, colorful makeup to accentuate eyes, cheeks, and lips. And now, you may have to fall into a TikTok hole, either — we\\'re here to help.What is Kidcore exactly? Trixie Mattel, the famed drag queen who is not known for subtly, tells Allure that “if you have to ask about kidcore, then you don\\'t know. If you\\'re not doing kidcore, you\\'re doing \\'adultcore.\\'\"Well, if you put that way, \\'adultcore\\' definitely reminds me of all our grown-up responsibilities — no thanks. Luckily, kidcore isn\\'t just for children. Plenty of adults are inspired by the aesthetic. \"As we age, I feel adults tend to start dressing more neutral,\" Mattel adds. \"We attribute bright clothing to youth; kidcore is bringing back color to play with.\"And why has this Y2K, ripped-from-a-Lisa-Frank-journal look taken off? \"I think it\\'s popular because it\\'s all about the dopamine effect, or the mood-lifting effect, of wearing things because they bring you joy and are just fun to look at,\" explains Donni Davy, cofounder of Half Magic Beauty and makeup artist for Euphoria.We talk to beauty experts and kidcore look creators to better understand the kidcore aesthetic and how to create the playful looks.What is kidcore?According to makeup artist and TikToker Chuck, \"kidcore is the bright side of goth — it is the same aesthetic, in a different color scheme.\" But instead of dark, vampy hues, the goal is to be bright and bold.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\"It plays into childlike innocence and being imaginative with your makeup,\" says Will Sullivan, a New York City-based makeup artist. \"I\\'ve seen some people add fun little stickers to their face (à la Olivia Rodrigo) or just rock it with a very bold lip.\" There\\'s no one way to do kidcore, but Sullivan says one hallmark is blush \"placed on the center of the face to give a sort of childish complexion.\"Kidcore could be seen as the rebellious younger sibling of minimalism and the pared-back \"clean beauty\" you\\'ve probably also seen all over TikTok (think just a touch of lip balm and an Olaplex bun). \"Kidcore is \\'just kidding, you don\\'t have to grow up,\\'\" Davy says. \"It\\'s fashion, makeup, and hairstyles that bring you joy, despite how \\'too old for that,\\' you are. I think it’s about joy being cool.\"TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Despite the \"innocence\" associated with the look, kidcore creators don\\'t aim for fetishization. One shouldn\\'t confuse kidcore with the popular Lolita aesthetic, which is a style that originated in Harajuku, Japan, and often associated with frilly, doll-like, or Victorian era clothing. \"I think kidcore is being compared to Lolita because it has that same childlike styling, but the intentions behind the two are different,\" Sullivan explains. \"We might get the two confused because some of the aesthetics from Tumblr in 2012 are starting to make a comeback, including Lolita.\"TikTok creator Kaiiya says that \"people get Lolita fashion mixed up with the book Lolita, written by Vladimir Nabokov. The book and the fashion have nothing to do with each other.\" While kidcore\\'s exaggerated strokes of eye makeup and lipstick could, under some interpretations, veer into Lolita fashion territory, that is not a focus of the makeup trend.Why is kidcore popular now? Creator and influencer Temple Jones describes kidcore \"as an aesthetic and as a mindset [that] reminds you to keep your youthful heart on your sleeve.\" It\\'s a way to honor your inner child and find a way to be creative with no judgements or second guessing.\"For many, kidcore means bright highly saturated colors and tacky styles from the \\'90s, but to me it is really just whatever that makes you feel happy with a slight sense of nostalgia,\" says makeup artist Serena Adelaide.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.For makeup artist Abby Ruhman, kidcore is personal. She has alopecia, an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss. \"Being a woman who is completely bald has really taught me to play more with my eye makeup and inspires me to express my femininity in a way that\\'s approachable, fun, colorful and bold,\" she says. \"I hope my tutorials and videos online inspire others to remember their child-like excitement around makeup and push their own creative boundaries and not take it too seriously.\"How do I do kidcore makeup?Kidcore might seem intimidating — but there\\'s an easy way to try it out. Sullivan recommends starting with blush, adding it to the center of your face. \"I\\'d start with a blush you really like, and use a brush or your fingers to gently tap it onto the apples of your cheeks and with whatever is leftover, tap on the bridge of your nose,\" she says. \"This could definitely be an everyday look and you can amp it up with bright, primary colors around the eyes and lips.\"Most Popularmakeup-looksNorth West’s Latest Viral TikTok Proves She’s a Zombie-Makeup ProdigyBy Chelsea AvilawellnessEach Zodiac Sign\\'s Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellynailsBlake Lively\\'s \"Antique Grandma\" Manicure Is Exactly What My Nails Need NextBy Hannah CoatesSullivan uses Glossier Cloud Paint, and Allure also loves the Tower 28 BeachPlease Luminous Tinted Balm.Glossier Cloud Paint$20 at GlossierTower 28 BeachPlease Luminous Tinted Balm$24 at SephoraIf you want to do more than blush, you\\'ve got options. \"Kidcore can be simple, such as a poppy lipstick eye shadow color, a bare face with a few stickers, gems, sparkles, or even a fun set of lashes,\" Jones says. \"I recommend visiting local craft and dollar stores and getting things like stickers, small trinkets to make jewelry with, pom poms, fabric paints or markers, beads, glitter, and string.\"TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Adelaide suggests starting with liquid face paints that are easy to work with. \"I really love the About Face Fluid Eye Paints and Mehron Makeup AQ Palette,\" she says. \"I\\'d highly recommend getting a mixing plate so you can create new colors without having to buy too many products. Having said that, focus on buying primary colors like red, blue and yellow but also don\\'t forget white and black so you can create lighter or darker colors with just these minimal options.\"About Face Matte Fluid Eye Paint$16 at About FaceMehron Makeup AQ Palette$100 at MehronCan I wear kid core makeup everyday?Our experts all say that elements of kidcore can be embraced, even if the most elaborate look may be a bridge too far for your personal style or daily regimen. According to Davy, \"if you want to do a more subtle version of it, I think there are loads of ways to bring kidcore into your look.\" From a panel eyeliner or lipstick to kooky hair accessories or heart-shaped bags, you have no shortage of kidcore accessorizing to test out.Or take a page out of Davy\\'s book: \"I\\'m a big fan of an all-black outfit with outrageous socks, a fun purse, and maybe a neon disco ball manicure.\" Now, off we go to tend to our inner children.Read more about TikTok beauty trends:Why Is TikTok So Obsessed With the \"Clean\" Beauty Look?

There\\'s no more gratifying (and, yes, expensive) way to keep your lips luscious than by wearing a gold-plated locket around your neck — with a luxe lip gloss inside. It\\'s as fancy as fancy gets. The same goes for a monogrammed hair brush, a lavish hand soap and hand cream set that’s delivered on a tray, and an Hermès blush brush.These are the posh beauty products that have Allure editors\\' attention.

But, we must say, these little luxurious exceed all of our expectations in terms of quality, efficacy, and innovation, and for that, we don\\'t hesitate to say, they are worth the splurge. So, upgrade your bobby pins to a dazzling new crystal set; coddle your skin in a cream that transforms your face overnight; pamper yourself with upscale bath salts — and delight in knowing it will be money well spent.On that note, go ahead and treat yourself to some of the finer things.

Attachments — a new curler for extra-long hair, a comb for coily textures — cater to every length and curl type.Oribe Hair Alchemy Resilience Shampoo + ConditionerOribe Hair Alchemy Resilience Shampoo$49 at AmazonOribe Hair Alchemy Resilience Conditioner$52 at AmazonWhy it won: A shampoo and conditioner that help strengthen strands from the inside out sounds like first-rate marketing jargon, but we\\'ll be damned if this duo (with chia seed and bamboo leaf) didn’t leave our hair noticeably less brittle and breakage-prone.Jennifer Behr Supernova Bobby Pin Set in CrystalJennifer Behr Supernova Bobby Pin Set in Crystal$425 at Jennifer BehrWhy it won: Do yourself a favor and don\\'t wait until your wedding day or a black-tie dinner to wear a little sparkle in your hair. Tucked at the base of a low ponytail or just above your ear, these Swarovski crystal pins pair just as beautifully with a white T-shirt as a ballgown.Prose Boar Bristle BrushProse Boar Bristle Brush$72 at ProseWhy it won: As if selecting your own style of bristles isn\\'t personal enough (boar for finer hair, the addition of nylon is great for medium-to-thick), you can also have your monogram stamped onto the handle — perhaps the most elegant way one can say \"This is my brush. Hands off!\"Balmain Hair Couture Overnight Repair SerumBalmain Hair Couture Overnight Repair Serum$125 at Net-a-PorterWhy it won: We just added \"bottle of Balmain hair serum will last longer\" to the list of reasons we\\'re contemplating getting a bob. That\\'s how crazy we are for this blend of seed oils and vitamins which, when used weekly as an overnight treatment, leaves our strands soft, smooth, and incredibly shiny.BodyTata Harper Skincare Resurfacing Body SerumTata Harper Skincare Resurfacing Body Serum$155 at AmazonWhy it won: If your arms and legs feel rough, itchy, or dry, why not slip into something a bit more comfortable?

After you swirl mouthwash from a glass decanter or apply whitening serum with a delicate paintbrush, you\\'ll never look back.Homecourt Steeped Rose Tray SetHomecourt Steeped Rose Tray Set$95 at HomecourtWhy it won: The \"you\" you\\'ve always wanted to be definitely owns this four-piece set, which corrals onto one sleek tray the bottles of dish soap, hand wash, and lotion kicking around your kitchen sink.

That\\'s a roundabout way of saying there\\'s been a sudden loss of volume. But when used over time, this peptide-rich serum helps restore plumpness, especially between the brows and around nasolabial folds.La Mer The New Treatment LotionLa Mer The New Treatment Lotion$125 at NordstromWhy it won: Apply liquid on a dry sponge and it sits on the surface.

The quick-to-absorb blend of amino acids and plant extracts leaves skin remarkably soft and supple.Chantecaille Bio Lifting Mask+Chantecaille Bio Lifting Mask+$198 at ChantecailleWhy it won: This mask makes more promises than the membership coordinator at our local gym. But we\\'re pleased to report the peptide-laden formula actually delivers: After a few applications, tester Amber Angelle reported her skin felt firm and looked more lifted. Now, about that free personal-training session....SkinMedica TNS+ Advanced SerumSkinMedica TNS+ Advanced Serum$295 at AmazonWhy it won: With elastin-building growth factors, this serum might just be the closest science has gotten to a Magic Eraser for skin: A clinical study found that twice-daily application led to visible improvement in tone, texture, and the reduction of the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles after two weeks.MakeupJillian Dempsey Lip LocketJillian Dempsey Lip Locket Necklace$485 at Jillian DempseyWhy it won: Some people like to wear lockets that hold a portrait of their partner. We prefer this one, which secretly stores our favorite tinted lip balm — and that’s just about all you need to know about our relationship with makeup.Sisley-Paris Ombré Eclat Liquide Liquid EyeshadowSisley-Paris Ombre Éclat Liquide$58 at NordstromWhy it won: They say money can\\'t solve everything, but shelling out for this liquid shadow eliminated virtually every problem we\\'ve ever had with eye makeup (creasing, running, flaking). And it takes all of five seconds to apply and blend, says beauty and wellness editor Taylore Glynn.Hermès Blush Plus BrushHermès\\tRose Hermes Silky Blush$78 at NordstromHermès Blush Plus Brush$100 at HermèsWhy it won: We could tell you this powder is so finely milled, it spreads like butter. Or that the fibers of the brush — hand-assembled by a French artisan — are so soft, you could sleep on them. But as with everything packaged in an orange box, luxury is kind of understood, right?Gucci Beauty Palette Beauté Des Yeux FloralGucci Beauty Palette Beauté Des Yeux Floral$149 at Saks Fifth AvenueWhy it won: If you\\'re like us, you\\'ll hit pan on these 12 shadows — in a mix of matte, satin, and metallic finishes — in no time.
