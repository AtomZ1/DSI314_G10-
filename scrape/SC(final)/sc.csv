5 Jewelry Trends For This Season You Won't Want to Miss,"You’ve slipped on your favorite dress, slid on a pair of kitten heels, and slicked your hair back into the perfect bun. You’re almost ready to walk out the door but your look is missing one major thing: details. Whether you identify with the “less is more” or “more is more” school of thought regarding fashion, both parties can agree that the best outfits include some kind of accessory. Summer’s jewelry trends have been solidified (and spoiler alert: they’ll easily last through the fall) and they’re just what you need to add that extra dazzling detail to your outfit.One of my favorite things about jewelry trends is that they aren’t as volatile as fashion trends. High-quality jewelry usually has sentimental value and also often comes with a higher price tag. This means that jewelry trends stick around for a more extended period of time because people aren’t looking to part ways with their favorite pieces.I take the personal approach of investing in my everyday staples like a simple gold chain, studs, or name initial ring and then letting myself have fun with less expensive costume jewelry. I also think finding inspiration from your friends and family is helpful. For example, my mom has a gold coin jewelry set that she’s worn throughout the last 20 years. The set makes a statement and has never gone out of style—I always admire the look of it when she wears it so I’d be willing to invest in a similar piece!The top jewelry trends this summer fall into the investment and trend categories. For example, the chain link necklaces, sleek silver hoops, and floral jewelry all have incredible longevity. If they tire out at any point, you know they’ll always eventually come back. On the trendier end, we have charm bracelets and initial necklaces. Both of these trends are meant to be customized which makes them great gift options—fashion is always more fun when you can share it with a friend.iMaxTree.1. FloralsFlorals are often associated with summer dresses or the tablescape at a dinner party, but the trend is in full bloom in the accessories sphere. Floral earrings are especially having a moment and are a fun twist on the whimsical look of tucking a flower behind your ear. The style works with statement earrings, flower-encrusted hoops or bracelet charms.iMaxTree.2. Sleek Silver HoopsOk if you haven’t caught on by now, all the hot girls and guys are wearing silver hoops. Big or small, stacked or single, silver hoops are still the coolest thing you can put in your ears (sorry Airpods). Feel free to mix metals and add a combination of silver and gold to your ear stack.iMaxTree.3. Chain Link NecklacesYou’re going to want to link up with this jewelry trend—literally. Chain link necklaces are the perfect everyday accessory and can be customized to your lifestyle. For example, I wear two delicate link chain necklaces every day that add subtle detail to my outfitsandI don’t have to take them on and off to sleep, shower, etc. You can choose how heavy you want the metal to be, how many you want to layer and if you want to add charms to your stack.iMaxTree.4. Initial JewelryJewelry is so personal and the initial and name jewelry trend proves it! Wearing a customizable name necklace, initial ring or both is a fun way to make a “this is me!” statement. Initial jewelry can also be a meaningful way to show your connection to someone else—whether it’s your significant other, parent or child’s initials, adding a piece to your collection will keep them close to you all day.Getty Images.5. Charm BraceletsCharm bracelets are back and better than ever. Tap into early 2000’s nostalgia with a decked-out charm bracelet on your wrist. Charms are a fun way to show off your niche interests, give your friend a meaningful gift, celebrate a memory or create a #twinning moment. "
Bangles & Big Hoops Are Bringing The '80s Back To Jewelry Trends," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.It’s easy to get caught up in revamping your wardrobe to fit the season’s latest trends. But between the cut-outs, faux fur coats, low-rise jeans, and dip-dye, the fashion trends may begin to seem overwhelming when the outfit options become endless. When you’re standing in the dressing room of Zara trying to determine which item to purchase, let me remind you that jewelry is often what makes and completes an outfit. So keep your fashion simple, grab your favorite black sweater or white button-down and shift your energy to focus on the jewelry trends for 2023. From simple silver hoops to bold bangles, there’s a jewelry trend to add a little extra flair to any look.While clothing always tells a story, jewelry is considered to be more personal. You may already have a signature piece that you wear every day or something with deep sentimental value. Oftentimes, these personally valuable pieces lean on the side of individual taste more than a trend, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do both. The best part of jewelry? Layers, stacks and statements pieces. The hardest part is picking which pieces to pair together!I interviewed jewelry designer and curator, Stephanie Gottlieb, for an expert opinion on how to play into 2023’s biggest jewelry moments and the key to finding a balance between trendy and timeless.First and foremost, if you’re looking to invest in your personal jewelry collection, it’s best to prioritize purchasing pieces that will maintain quality and value.“I always recommend for a new buyer to start with the classics like diamond studs, a tennis bracelet, or a diamond stack bands and then if you’re wanting to introduce the trendy pieces do that after you’ve already built the wardrobe of the staples,” Gottlieb advises. But when it comes to trendy pieces, Gottlieb says the opposite, “Buy costume to start and upgrade over time as the budget allows. You can sprinkle in less expensive fashion-forward trendy pieces.”Tom Ford; iMaxTree.Her advice seems simple enough—invest in quality, play with quantity! Luckily, 2023’s jewelry trends give you the opportunity to do a bit of both. Classic silver and gold pieces aren’t going anywhere—if anything, they’re getting more popular. If you’ve already built a collection of Hailey Bieber-inspired gold hoops (I sure know I have), consider mixing in some silver metal and vice versa. Don’t be afraid to upgrade your classic metals but simply goingbigger.According to Gottlieb, “We’re going to see a big comeback of the ‘80s and still some of the ‘90s. Think lots of chunky gold jewelry, big hoops and geometric shapes.” Based on the Spring/Summer ‘23 runway shows, Gottlieb is spot on.Keep reading for the five biggest jewelry trends expected to shine throughout 2023 (hey, it’s never too early to start wearing them!).Tory Burch; Jonathan Simkhai, iMaxTree.Totally CuffedA silver or gold cuff is the perfect example of a way to make a subtle statement with just one piece. Cuff bracelets are proving themselves to be the easiest way to elevate any look. The silhouette is often just a thick, arched curve but the impact is big! For starters, cuffs are usually adjustable which means you can wear them in multiple ways. If you prefer a classic look, add a cuff (or two) around your wrist to shine under the sleeve of your shirt or sweater. To make the trend more interesting, slip the cuff up your forearm like the models wore at Missoni, or opt for a wrap-around cuff as seen on the models at Tory Burch.Courtesy of Banana Republic.Hammered Cuff BraceletThis silver cuff has a wave structure to it which will help reflect light and make it super eye-catching. Plus, it’s only $30 so it’s a great way to try out to trend without feeling handcuffed to it.   Hammered Cuff Bracelet $30 (was $50)     Buy Now Courtesy of Karine Sultan.Four Row CuffI love this tiered cuff for special occasions. Pair it with a strapless or slip dress to add dimension to your look.   Four Row Cuff$98     Buy Now Jil Sander; Missoni, iMaxTree.Superior SilverGold has been associated with first place for long enough, it’s silver’s time to shine. Oversized silver statement hoops were a staple on the spring/summer ’23 runway and the second I saw Bella Hadid wear them during the Jil Sander show, I was sold. I’m putting my bets in now that she repeats the silver hoops for a street-style moment. Oversized silver hoops are another ’80s trend but they look incredibly modern when paired with 2023’s runway trends. For everyday wear, consider downsizing the hoop size (your ears will thank you) and leave the big guys for special occasions.Courtesy of Stephanie Gottlieb.35mm Tube Hoop EarringsIf you plan on wearing a pair of earrings on a daily basis, it’s definitely worth investing in a pair that won’t irritate your ears or tarnish. This pair of tube hoops by Stephanie Gottlieb are actually made with 14k white gold and are well worth the higher price point.   35mm Tube Hoop Earrings $520     Buy Now Courtesy of Zara.Rectangular EarringsSometimes it’s just easier to go with a faux-hoop (aka stud). This pair from Zara has a unique rectangular shape that will pair great with your go=to blazer.   Rectangular Earrings $17.90     Buy Now Blumarine; Coach, iMaxTree.Strands of BeadsThinly beaded necklaces are the perfect trend for layering experts. Whether you’re stacking multiple strands of the same beads, mixing and matching, or just letting a singular strand speak for itself, this boho trend is a casual way to accessorize. Take notes from Blumarine, the totally Y2 K-inspired brand, and add a charm to a beaded strand, or get inspired by Coach’s quirky decision to add unusual objects to a long strand like a sports whistle. You don’t need to wear a flower crown or long skirt for beads to work with your outfit.Courtesy of Nordstrom.Carabiner Beaded NecklaceSpeaking of unconventional objects, this beaded necklace comes with an adorable carabiner charm and makes the perfect gift for an outdoorsy friend.   Carabiner Beaded Necklace $24.50 (was $49)     Buy Now Courtesy of Mejuri.Coastal Blue Lace Agate NecklaceMejuri is known for their everyday gold jewelry but turns out they have a great selection of beaded options as well. I love this blue agate necklace for a beachy vibe.   Coastal Blue Lace Agate Necklace$198     Buy Now Tory Burch; Ulla Johnson, iMaxTree.Back to BohoRemember when everyone had hair feathers? Me too. Well, we’re bringing the essence of the trend back in a significantly less-cringy way with dangly boho earrings. Whether the earrings have feathers, fringe or simple just hang past your collarbone, this earring trend is a fun alternative to the sparkly night-luxe earrings we were seeing last season (and work significantly better for daytime activities).Courtesy of Anthropologie.Circle Drop EarringsTe studs on this pair of circle drop earrings totally look like a full moon! Wear them to manifest good vibes for 2023.   Circle Drop Earrings $54     Buy Now Courtesy of Free People.Jaxon Stone HoopIt’s no surprise that Free People is the go-to for boho accessories. I love this pair of charm hoops with long tassel ends.   Jaxon Stone Hoop$28     Buy Now Patbo; Laquan Smith, iMaxTree.Bangin’ BanglesBangles are back and I’m not mad about it! Bangles are like a cuff bracelet’s fun younger sister–they may not be as sophisticated but they certainly know how to party! The ’80s-inspired accessory is a great way to play up a look for a night out and show off your personality. If you don’t already have bangles stored away from an old Halloween costume, take this trend as an opportunity to build your collection—and I literally mean build it! Building a stack of bangles is the most creative way to participate—geometric shapes, clear acrylics, and animal print patterns are all fair game.Courtesy of Asos.2-Pack Bangles in Clear and BlueThis is a trend you certainly don’t need to break the bank for. This set of 2 bangles is under $15 and would look amazing with a sparkly mini dress or skirt for girl’s night.   2-Pack Bangles in Clear and Blue $14.50     Buy Now Courtesy of Alexis Bittar.Molten 14K Goldplated Hinged Lucite BraceletIf you can’t help but splurge on a boujie bangle, I recommend this gold-plated lucite bracelet by Alexis Bittar.

"Trust Us, You Don't Want To Sleep On This Jewelry Trend"," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.I’m very lucky because my mom is a total fashion icon. When we go shopping together, we almost always leave with matching fashion finds. For this reason, the mother-daughter matching jewelry trend is perfect.I’ve been stealing her clothes, bags and jewelry for as long as I can remember and incorporating them into my own wardrobe. I even got caught trying to bring some of her items to college with me (my mission was unsuccessful). I love the idea of coordinating jewelry because it’s a way to bring everyday sentimental value to both of our looks. It also saves us from being too matchy-matchy and doubles our options (because we obviously still swap pieces).Coordinating jewelry, especially in a mother-daughter sense, doesn’t need to feel like a gimmick. Don’t get me wrong, I was a huge fan of matching friendship bracelets and half-heart necklaces as a kid but I want my grown-up jewelry to feel a little more elevated.Now I look for easy ways to build continuity between our collections. One way this can be done is by focusing on a motif, like the stars or the moon, and finding pieces within that theme. I also love the idea of choosing a stone or jewel and finding jewelry that features the same element.AP Images.Zoë Kravitz and her mom Lisa Bonet do an incredible job of coordinating jewelry in a way that still speaks to their individual personal styles. Kravitz’s gold earrings and body chain compliment Bonet’s bird brooch on her collar and gold hoops.A lot of jewelry brands also have signature styles that they incorporate throughout most of their pieces. By shopping for jewelry from the same brand, there’s a good chance that the design elements will be consistent throughout—you can take a brand’s signature style and make it one you and your mom are known for wearing.AP Images.If being subtle isn’t your thing, take a page out of Kris and Khloe Kardashian’s book and go bold. The Kardashian duo not only wore bright diamond earrings, but coordinated their twisted glitter dresses. This is a fun way to make sure everyone is aware of family ties at functions.Whether you’re pairing earrings and bracelets or rings and necklaces, mother-daughter jewelry is so sweet and sentimental. Mother’s Day is also quickly approaching so this is a great way to get your mom and yourself (for the sake of the trend of course) something special.Keep reading for my favorite coordinating picks.A Pearl PairPerhaps the most classic way to coordinate with your mom is by wearing complementary sets of pearls. Pearl jewelry is a staple of sophisticated style but can also allude to the more carefree fashion of the 1920s. Pearls are currently having a modern resurgence and are being incorporated into heavy chain necklaces, huggie earrings or other gem clusters. This means that even if you are a die-hard Y2K grunge-girl and your mom prefers a classic strand, you can still coordinate jewelry and have a meaningful connection.To The Moon & BackIf you’re into astrology or just love spending a long night under the stars, moon and star-themed jewelry is a great way to connect with your mom and the great unknown. Stars are super on-trend for jewelry right now so it’s easy to find celestial gems to wear. One of you can sport a crescent moon necklace while the other wears sparkly star earring studs (or vice versa) to stick with the theme. If you want to get multiple siblings in on the look, a moon and star charm bracelet is also a fun option for everyone to wear.Diamonds Are Your Mom’s Best FriendYou don’t have to have an heirloom engagement ring to connect to your family with diamonds. Diamonds come in all shapes and sizes which makes them easy to personalize and fun to mix and match. A matching pair of small diamond studs are great for everyday wear and will be a subtle daily reminder of your mom. Having different pieces in the same shape or setting is another way to have a subtle #twinning moment. Diamonds are also available in moissanite and lab-grown alternatives so you don’t have to break the bank to participate. "

I tend to pick a few more expensive pieces of jewelry and wear them for months without taking them off. Because of my long-time commitment to jewelry I end up gravitating towards timeless pieces but recently, the spring jewelry trends for 2022 have caught my eye.Suddenly, I’m interested in switching out my classic gold jewelry for understated silver.

13 Ways To Start Wearing Spring's Enamel Jewelry Trend Right Now,"I’m the type of gal who sticks to a few gold earrings or a simple gold chain and calls it a day, so I never thought I would be one to gravitate toward colorful jewelry. But if 2021 has taught me anything so far, it’s that I should probably branch out and try new things, and my newfound color obsession is making it that easy. Case in point: I have (somehow) fallen head over heels for the enamel jewelry trendthat has been taking over my social media feeds. Luckily for me, these rainbow-brite pieces don’t seem to be going away anytime soon.It all started when I spotted a pair of Mejuri’s enamel hoops while aimlessly browsing the web the other night and instantly fell in love. I thought it was simply because I was tired, so I shut my laptop and tried to forget about them—but I couldn’t. Turns out, that was just the beginning of my enamel jewelry spiral.

Monochrome Ring$75     Buy Now Courtesy of Roxanne Assoulin.These Funky Rainbow HoopsRoxanne Assoulin has won the fashion world over with her collection of playful and colorful jewelry, and these hoop earrings are actually a bit more subdued when compared to her other pieces.

Mejuri's New Enamel Rings Nail 2021's Hottest Jewelry Trend,"Our opportunities to experiment with style took a massive hit over the last year, but the accessories we chose to wear while working from home were our saving grace. I seriously miss the days prior to then where I could put on “real” pants and deck myself out in every blingy earring, bracelet and necklace in my jewelry box. Now that we’re starting to go out and about again, hopefully, Mejuri’s brand-new enamel rings can help me get a handle on some of 2021’s biggest jewelry trends.I once thought colorful jewelry was a thing of the past. Sure, I used to stack on bright bangles and plastic rings when I played dress-up as a kid, but I’ve opted for wearing more understated pieces made from gold or silver since becoming a real adult. That said, it looks like Mejuri is officially making colors cool again with their new selection of enamel pieces, and I’m surprisingly here for it. The collection includes two ring styles and a pair of hoop earrings that come in shades of green, brown and blue. If you’re a true magpie at heart, don’t fret—these enamel pieces are adorned with a single shiny stone in the center for an added blingy bonus.All trends really do end up coming back around. Similar to the pearl jewelry craze that took over my Instagram feed last month and revived the look I once considered stuffy and outdated, enamel is being completely reinvented in 2021. In Mejuri’s collection, the colors are more understated rather than bold or intense, so they’ll play well with your favorite metallic pieces and chunky gold chains. Just like everything else Mejuri sells, these rings are just bold enough to make a statement.Add a few of these rings into your collection for a playful pop of color this season. Read on to see all of the pretty shades.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

Bangles & Big Hoops Are Bringing The '80s Back To Jewelry Trends,"Sure, diamond rings and classic pendant necklace—from lockets to shell-adorned chokers, and everything in between— is definitely jewelry staples that every accessory lover should own at least one of in their personal collection, but if you’re looking to add a bit of either edge of elegance to your look, embellishing your wrist with statement arm candy is your best bet for looking subtle yet adding a little something extra to help refine your overall look.

"Trust Us, You Don't Want To Sleep On This Jewelry Trend","You’ve slipped on your favorite dress, slid on a pair of kitten heels, and slicked your hair back into the perfect bun. You’re almost ready to walk out the door but your look is missing one major thing: details. Whether you identify with the “less is more” or “more is more” school of thought regarding fashion, both parties can agree that the best outfits include some kind of accessory. Summer’s jewelry trends have been solidified (and spoiler alert: they’ll easily last through the fall) and they’re just what you need to add that extra dazzling detail to your outfit.One of my favorite things about jewelry trends is that they aren’t as volatile as fashion trends. High-quality jewelry usually has sentimental value and also often comes with a higher price tag. This means that jewelry trends stick around for a more extended period of time because people aren’t looking to part ways with their favorite pieces.I take the personal approach of investing in my everyday staples like a simple gold chain, studs, or name initial ring and then letting myself have fun with less expensive costume jewelry. I also think finding inspiration from your friends and family is helpful. For example, my mom has a gold coin jewelry set that she’s worn throughout the last 20 years. The set makes a statement and has never gone out of style—I always admire the look of it when she wears it so I’d be willing to invest in a similar piece!The top jewelry trends this summer fall into the investment and trend categories. For example, the chain link necklaces, sleek silver hoops, and floral jewelry all have incredible longevity. If they tire out at any point, you know they’ll always eventually come back. On the trendier end, we have charm bracelets and initial necklaces. Both of these trends are meant to be customized which makes them great gift options—fashion is always more fun when you can share it with a friend.iMaxTree.1. FloralsFlorals are often associated with summer dresses or the tablescape at a dinner party, but the trend is in full bloom in the accessories sphere. Floral earrings are especially having a moment and are a fun twist on the whimsical look of tucking a flower behind your ear. The style works with statement earrings, flower-encrusted hoops or bracelet charms.iMaxTree.2. Sleek Silver HoopsOk if you haven’t caught on by now, all the hot girls and guys are wearing silver hoops. Big or small, stacked or single, silver hoops are still the coolest thing you can put in your ears (sorry Airpods). Feel free to mix metals and add a combination of silver and gold to your ear stack.iMaxTree.3. Chain Link NecklacesYou’re going to want to link up with this jewelry trend—literally. Chain link necklaces are the perfect everyday accessory and can be customized to your lifestyle. For example, I wear two delicate link chain necklaces every day that add subtle detail to my outfitsandI don’t have to take them on and off to sleep, shower, etc. You can choose how heavy you want the metal to be, how many you want to layer and if you want to add charms to your stack.iMaxTree.4. Initial JewelryJewelry is so personal and the initial and name jewelry trend proves it! Wearing a customizable name necklace, initial ring or both is a fun way to make a “this is me!” statement. Initial jewelry can also be a meaningful way to show your connection to someone else—whether it’s your significant other, parent or child’s initials, adding a piece to your collection will keep them close to you all day.Getty Images.5. Charm BraceletsCharm bracelets are back and better than ever. Tap into early 2000’s nostalgia with a decked-out charm bracelet on your wrist. Charms are a fun way to show off your niche interests, give your friend a meaningful gift, celebrate a memory or create a #twinning moment. "
"Layer Up, Kids—The Top 2022 Jewelry Trends Are Here"," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.It’s easy to get caught up in revamping your wardrobe to fit the season’s latest trends. But between the cut-outs, faux fur coats, low-rise jeans, and dip-dye, the fashion trends may begin to seem overwhelming when the outfit options become endless. When you’re standing in the dressing room of Zara trying to determine which item to purchase, let me remind you that jewelry is often what makes and completes an outfit. So keep your fashion simple, grab your favorite black sweater or white button-down and shift your energy to focus on the jewelry trends for 2023. From simple silver hoops to bold bangles, there’s a jewelry trend to add a little extra flair to any look.While clothing always tells a story, jewelry is considered to be more personal. You may already have a signature piece that you wear every day or something with deep sentimental value. Oftentimes, these personally valuable pieces lean on the side of individual taste more than a trend, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do both. The best part of jewelry? Layers, stacks and statements pieces. The hardest part is picking which pieces to pair together!I interviewed jewelry designer and curator, Stephanie Gottlieb, for an expert opinion on how to play into 2023’s biggest jewelry moments and the key to finding a balance between trendy and timeless.First and foremost, if you’re looking to invest in your personal jewelry collection, it’s best to prioritize purchasing pieces that will maintain quality and value.“I always recommend for a new buyer to start with the classics like diamond studs, a tennis bracelet, or a diamond stack bands and then if you’re wanting to introduce the trendy pieces do that after you’ve already built the wardrobe of the staples,” Gottlieb advises. But when it comes to trendy pieces, Gottlieb says the opposite, “Buy costume to start and upgrade over time as the budget allows. You can sprinkle in less expensive fashion-forward trendy pieces.”Tom Ford; iMaxTree.Her advice seems simple enough—invest in quality, play with quantity! Luckily, 2023’s jewelry trends give you the opportunity to do a bit of both. Classic silver and gold pieces aren’t going anywhere—if anything, they’re getting more popular. If you’ve already built a collection of Hailey Bieber-inspired gold hoops (I sure know I have), consider mixing in some silver metal and vice versa. Don’t be afraid to upgrade your classic metals but simply goingbigger.According to Gottlieb, “We’re going to see a big comeback of the ‘80s and still some of the ‘90s. Think lots of chunky gold jewelry, big hoops and geometric shapes.” Based on the Spring/Summer ‘23 runway shows, Gottlieb is spot on.Keep reading for the five biggest jewelry trends expected to shine throughout 2023 (hey, it’s never too early to start wearing them!).Tory Burch; Jonathan Simkhai, iMaxTree.Totally CuffedA silver or gold cuff is the perfect example of a way to make a subtle statement with just one piece. Cuff bracelets are proving themselves to be the easiest way to elevate any look. The silhouette is often just a thick, arched curve but the impact is big! For starters, cuffs are usually adjustable which means you can wear them in multiple ways. If you prefer a classic look, add a cuff (or two) around your wrist to shine under the sleeve of your shirt or sweater. To make the trend more interesting, slip the cuff up your forearm like the models wore at Missoni, or opt for a wrap-around cuff as seen on the models at Tory Burch.Courtesy of Banana Republic.Hammered Cuff BraceletThis silver cuff has a wave structure to it which will help reflect light and make it super eye-catching. Plus, it’s only $30 so it’s a great way to try out to trend without feeling handcuffed to it.

Four Row Cuff$98     Buy Now Jil Sander; Missoni, iMaxTree.Superior SilverGold has been associated with first place for long enough, it’s silver’s time to shine. Oversized silver statement hoops were a staple on the spring/summer ’23 runway and the second I saw Bella Hadid wear them during the Jil Sander show, I was sold. I’m putting my bets in now that she repeats the silver hoops for a street-style moment. Oversized silver hoops are another ’80s trend but they look incredibly modern when paired with 2023’s runway trends. For everyday wear, consider downsizing the hoop size (your ears will thank you) and leave the big guys for special occasions.Courtesy of Stephanie Gottlieb.35mm Tube Hoop EarringsIf you plan on wearing a pair of earrings on a daily basis, it’s definitely worth investing in a pair that won’t irritate your ears or tarnish.

Take notes from Blumarine, the totally Y2 K-inspired brand, and add a charm to a beaded strand, or get inspired by Coach’s quirky decision to add unusual objects to a long strand like a sports whistle.

5 Summer Jewelry Trends That Work From The Beach To Happy Hour," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.I’m very lucky because my mom is a total fashion icon. When we go shopping together, we almost always leave with matching fashion finds. For this reason, the mother-daughter matching jewelry trend is perfect.I’ve been stealing her clothes, bags and jewelry for as long as I can remember and incorporating them into my own wardrobe. I even got caught trying to bring some of her items to college with me (my mission was unsuccessful). I love the idea of coordinating jewelry because it’s a way to bring everyday sentimental value to both of our looks. It also saves us from being too matchy-matchy and doubles our options (because we obviously still swap pieces).Coordinating jewelry, especially in a mother-daughter sense, doesn’t need to feel like a gimmick. Don’t get me wrong, I was a huge fan of matching friendship bracelets and half-heart necklaces as a kid but I want my grown-up jewelry to feel a little more elevated.Now I look for easy ways to build continuity between our collections. One way this can be done is by focusing on a motif, like the stars or the moon, and finding pieces within that theme. I also love the idea of choosing a stone or jewel and finding jewelry that features the same element.AP Images.Zoë Kravitz and her mom Lisa Bonet do an incredible job of coordinating jewelry in a way that still speaks to their individual personal styles. Kravitz’s gold earrings and body chain compliment Bonet’s bird brooch on her collar and gold hoops.A lot of jewelry brands also have signature styles that they incorporate throughout most of their pieces. By shopping for jewelry from the same brand, there’s a good chance that the design elements will be consistent throughout—you can take a brand’s signature style and make it one you and your mom are known for wearing.AP Images.If being subtle isn’t your thing, take a page out of Kris and Khloe Kardashian’s book and go bold. The Kardashian duo not only wore bright diamond earrings, but coordinated their twisted glitter dresses. This is a fun way to make sure everyone is aware of family ties at functions.Whether you’re pairing earrings and bracelets or rings and necklaces, mother-daughter jewelry is so sweet and sentimental. Mother’s Day is also quickly approaching so this is a great way to get your mom and yourself (for the sake of the trend of course) something special.Keep reading for my favorite coordinating picks.A Pearl PairPerhaps the most classic way to coordinate with your mom is by wearing complementary sets of pearls. Pearl jewelry is a staple of sophisticated style but can also allude to the more carefree fashion of the 1920s. Pearls are currently having a modern resurgence and are being incorporated into heavy chain necklaces, huggie earrings or other gem clusters. This means that even if you are a die-hard Y2K grunge-girl and your mom prefers a classic strand, you can still coordinate jewelry and have a meaningful connection.To The Moon & BackIf you’re into astrology or just love spending a long night under the stars, moon and star-themed jewelry is a great way to connect with your mom and the great unknown. Stars are super on-trend for jewelry right now so it’s easy to find celestial gems to wear. One of you can sport a crescent moon necklace while the other wears sparkly star earring studs (or vice versa) to stick with the theme. If you want to get multiple siblings in on the look, a moon and star charm bracelet is also a fun option for everyone to wear.Diamonds Are Your Mom’s Best FriendYou don’t have to have an heirloom engagement ring to connect to your family with diamonds. Diamonds come in all shapes and sizes which makes them easy to personalize and fun to mix and match. A matching pair of small diamond studs are great for everyday wear and will be a subtle daily reminder of your mom. Having different pieces in the same shape or setting is another way to have a subtle #twinning moment. Diamonds are also available in moissanite and lab-grown alternatives so you don’t have to break the bank to participate. "

"2020's Top Jewelry Trends Are All About Drama, So Layer Up","I’m the type of gal who sticks to a few gold earrings or a simple gold chain and calls it a day, so I never thought I would be one to gravitate toward colorful jewelry. But if 2021 has taught me anything so far, it’s that I should probably branch out and try new things, and my newfound color obsession is making it that easy. Case in point: I have (somehow) fallen head over heels for the enamel jewelry trendthat has been taking over my social media feeds. Luckily for me, these rainbow-brite pieces don’t seem to be going away anytime soon.It all started when I spotted a pair of Mejuri’s enamel hoops while aimlessly browsing the web the other night and instantly fell in love. I thought it was simply because I was tired, so I shut my laptop and tried to forget about them—but I couldn’t. Turns out, that was just the beginning of my enamel jewelry spiral. Now, I’ve found tons of different options at literally every price point imaginable, and they’re all sitting in my cart waiting for me to pull the proverbial trigger and place a slew of orders.So, I’ve rounded up 13 of my favorite pieces of enamel jewelry to share with you, in hopes that I won’t be the only one impulse-shopping. And when I say these price points are good, I mean it!

Chunky Chain Bracelets to Instantly Elevate Your Look,"Our opportunities to experiment with style took a massive hit over the last year, but the accessories we chose to wear while working from home were our saving grace. I seriously miss the days prior to then where I could put on “real” pants and deck myself out in every blingy earring, bracelet and necklace in my jewelry box. Now that we’re starting to go out and about again, hopefully, Mejuri’s brand-new enamel rings can help me get a handle on some of 2021’s biggest jewelry trends.I once thought colorful jewelry was a thing of the past. Sure, I used to stack on bright bangles and plastic rings when I played dress-up as a kid, but I’ve opted for wearing more understated pieces made from gold or silver since becoming a real adult. That said, it looks like Mejuri is officially making colors cool again with their new selection of enamel pieces, and I’m surprisingly here for it. The collection includes two ring styles and a pair of hoop earrings that come in shades of green, brown and blue. If you’re a true magpie at heart, don’t fret—these enamel pieces are adorned with a single shiny stone in the center for an added blingy bonus.All trends really do end up coming back around. Similar to the pearl jewelry craze that took over my Instagram feed last month and revived the look I once considered stuffy and outdated, enamel is being completely reinvented in 2021. In Mejuri’s collection, the colors are more understated rather than bold or intense, so they’ll play well with your favorite metallic pieces and chunky gold chains. Just like everything else Mejuri sells, these rings are just bold enough to make a statement.Add a few of these rings into your collection for a playful pop of color this season.

"This Spring, Shell Pendants Might Just Replace Last Year’s Coin Jewelry Obsession","While some look to the runways to see what all the models are wearing on their bodies, I’m more interested in what they’ve got on their ears. And on their fingers, and around their necks—do you see where I’m going with this? Earrings, rings and necklaces are the keys to my heart, and lucky for me, all the 2020 jewelry trends are full-on obsession-worthy.Designers like Christian Siriano made a case for chunky, punk-inspired chains, while others, like Ulla Johnson and Zimmermann, showed off more playful looks like fun mismatched earrings and charm necklaces, respectively. There’s no shortage of statement jewelry calling my name this season, and I can’t wait to pair all these trends with cozy fall and winter ensembles.One of the best parts about jewelry is that it has the ability to elevate any outfit. Wearing a white tee and jeans? Add a chunky gold chain necklace or some fun dangly earrings and suddenly it’s a whole lewk. Unsure of how to wear your favorite LBD this season? Just add some statement jewelry (in either colorful hues or classics like gold and silver) and spice things up a bit. There are endless ways to use jewelry to amp up even the simplest of outfits—as well as add to maximalist looks. In other words, if your jewelry collection isn’t totally stacked right now, it’s time to shop some of the latest trends.Below, you’ll find a few very cool 2020 jewelry trends worth trying this year, as well as wearing into 2021.

Anklets Are Summer 2019's Coolest Jewelry Trend,"Sure, diamond rings and classic pendant necklace—from lockets to shell-adorned chokers, and everything in between— is definitely jewelry staples that every accessory lover should own at least one of in their personal collection, but if you’re looking to add a bit of either edge of elegance to your look, embellishing your wrist with statement arm candy is your best bet for looking subtle yet adding a little something extra to help refine your overall look.

"So Everyone Is Obsessed With Pearls Now, Right?","It’s hardly a stretch to make the argument that last year’s biggest overarching jewelry trend was the Instagram-famous coin necklace, endorsed by countless influencers, style editors and street style stars alike. It makes sense that this classic jewelry style went remarkably viral, as coin necklaces offer the utmost versatility, thanks to their infinitely stackable appeal (the coin and nameplate duo have remained a popular layering combo)—punctuated, of course, by their inherently vintage charm. This spring, though, there’s a new influencer-approved jewelry trend on the block: seashell jewelry.Not only are gilded seashell-shaped designs cropping up as adornments on necklaces, but the resort-ready motif is also a dominant embellishment for rings, statement earrings and hair accessories this season. Even ’90s-era puka shells are coming back to life in modernized jewelry styles that—don’t worry—aren’t exact replicas of the throwback styles beloved by teenage surfers of decades’ past.Before you begin to cringe at this beachy trend’s somewhat startling resurrection, know that today’s puka-imbued jewelry has been revised with polished updates that prevent the designs from looking like an artifact of ’90s ska culture—or some overpriced souvenir purchased at the hotel gift shop during your childhood family vacation. And, if you still need further proof that the unlikely style’s return to fashion is, in fact, a thing, look to none other than Gigi Hadid, who was spotted sporting a puka choker during Paris Fashion Week.Of course, if you can’t even entertain the idea of bringing back the vacation-inspired chokers of your youth, there are plenty of other shell-designed iterations of this under-the-sea trend that feel a bit more refined. Traditional conch shell designs, spiraling shark eyes, and sophisticated sand dollars with opalescent finishes feel more sophisticated (and office-appropriate) than kitsch or novel.And let’s be clear about one thing: last year’s coin necklaces are a timeless, ultra-wearable jewelry piece, so we’re certainly not writing them off as a thing of the past. But if you’ve grown tired of the endlessly ubiquitous coin trend, opt for one of these fresh, under-the-sea (and summer-ready) alternatives, instead.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

Why Jewelry Is the Best Staple Piece to Pass Down Generations,"I’ve never had a particularly kitschy fashion sense, but lately, accessorizing with a bit of whimsy just brings me joy—hence why I’m leaning into 2020’s fruit jewelry trend so damn hard. Somewhere between the cottagecore/picnic aesthetic and the classic Girl Next Door exists a perfect blend of the two: The Girl Next Door Who Owns Too Many Plants, Has A Window Sill Garden & Wears Fruit Jewelry. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m happy to announce that I am she. She is me. We are one.But to be clear, I’m not the only one in love with the look. After luxury brands like Mercedes Salazar debuted fun, fruity accessories for summer (I’ve been dreaming about their Tropics Strawberry Earrings for months) and Insta-famous brands like Et Toi Paris littered my Explore Page with cutesy fruitsy jewelry, it seemed the trend was everywhere—and don’t even get me started about the amount of fruit jewelry on Etsy. It’s not to be believed, y’all. Whether or not you think a salad complements your meal, a fruit-themed accessory can and will complement your outfit, so don’t hesitate to try the trend out.Bella Gerard.My personal recommendation for cute statement fruit jewelry that doesn’t look cheesy? I’ve been lovingUK-based brand I’MMANY London‘s Summer Capsule ’20, full of strawberries, grapes and the like. I’MMANY’s collection is about as chic as produce-themed jewelry can get, and the star of the show are undoubtedly their wide array of cherry earrings. You can shop single-drop stems or two-cherry earrings, and choose from a classic red hue to more playful colorways like iridescent lilac, pink and light gray.Bella Gerard.   Double Cherry Drop Earrings$124.60     Buy Now Besides the gold-plated brass brass stems, the coloring on theDouble Cherry Drop Earringslooks so realistic—like, it almost looks as if I went to the grocery store and Michael’s and DIY’d these babies myself. While cherries can sometimes look a little too retro or kitschy, these are actually super classy, and I especially love the idea of pairing them with an all-white outfit, a reddish lip stain and some faux freckles for good measure.Bella Gerard.   Red StrawberryHuggie Hoop Earring$56.64     Buy Now A slightly smaller statement that’s just as sweet is theRed StrawberryHuggie Hoop Earring, sold singular so that you can mix and match with I’MMANY’s other huggie hoops, should you choose to. Fruit jewelry is already as bold as I’ll go, so I played it safe with two red strawberries, but there are also sweet little leaves and berries of all sorts of colors to choose from. My favorite part? That itty-bitty pearl detail at the top, of course.Bella Gerard.If you’re ready to spice up your neutral summer wardrobe with a few statement accessories, the fruit jewelry trend is the move, and I can’t recommend I’MMANY London’s selection enough. Did I mention they also have a Garden Society Collection full of even more produce? Suddenly, I’m in need of a red pepper necklace and a lettuce leaf charm bracelet.

Kylie Jenner Is Fielding Criticism Over Baby Girl Stormi's Personalized Hoop Earrings,"There are few celebs I admire more than Hailey Bieber when it comes to off-duty style. I honestly can’t think of a time when I didn’t want to copy something she’s worn—and if her Instagram feed is any indication, it looks like Bieber is ready to serve up inspo for my entire summer wardrobe, especiallymy beach outfits! The model just posted a pic in the most delicate gold body chain and I’m obsessed with her take on styling body jewelry for 2021.ICYMI: It’s May, people! Summer is here and no one is more ready for warm weather than Hailey Bieber. I mean, she’s already showing off her bikini collection on the ‘gram and I’m taking detailed notes! Her most recent post featured a baby pink string bikini from TRIANGL paired with the real star of the show, a glimmering body chain by Jacquie Aiche styled with two coordinating diamond necklaces. She topped off her look with a pair of chunky gold hoop earrings and a few Y2K-inspired mini ponytails around the crown of her head. Yup, copying this look ASAP!         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Hailey Rhode Baldwin Bieber (@haileybieber)If the words “body chain” traumatize you, fear not. These are not the chunky waist chains of the early aughts! Bieber’s version is of a far more delicate nature, which feels much more modern and chic. It also makes the accessory more wearable in my eyes. You can style it like she did over a bikini or wear it under any number of crop tops for some added glitz. Forget other jewelry trends of the season: This summer is all about the beachy body bling.Bieber’s chain was covered in diamonds and costs more than a few thousand bucks, so no, it’s not exactly affordable. But you can still get the look for less! I was able to source a few inexpensive options for you to buy right now if you are trying to copy her blingy bikini vibes.

Hailey Bieber's Go-To Choker Is More Than 50% Off & We're Shocked It Hasn't Sold Out Yet,"When I was a wee elementary schooler, nothing—and I meannothing—made me feel as cool as I did when I wore an anklet. The early-aughts anklets trend empowered me to feel like a beach beauty and badass surfer girl rolled into one. As I lived in middle Tennessee, I was basically never wearing an anklet on or near the beach (or really, anywhere other than Kroger or Target). But I feltcool. I felttransported. I felt like the kind of fashion-forward 8-year-old I knew I was every time I spent hours styling and re-styling my Polly Pocket dolls. 2019’s take on the anklets trend has basically left me feeling the exact same way.These days, my time outdoors is no longer spent near-exclusively at Kroger and Target. And my time spent indoors is no longer spent near-exclusively styling Polly Pocket dolls. (Don’t fret—I’ve been sans Polly Pocket since middle school. You are not reading a fashion story penned by a 25-year-old who still plays with dolls.) I am still in middle Tennessee, so decidedly far from basically any beach—leaving me anything but a beach beauty or badass surfer girl (or some endlessly cool hybrid of the two). I’m an editor who spends her days writing in coffeeshops, working out at the YMCA and—when I’m feeling fancy—eating at Nashville’s trendiest restaurants. None of these settings lend themselves particularly well to anklets, especially now that I’m a 25-year-old with a full-time job andnot an elementary schooler who can basically wear anything she damn well pleases.It’s been challenging, then, for me to wrap my head around the 2019 anklet renaissance. As a fan of basically every retro revival to hit the zeitgeist, I’m predisposed to love it. But as a bona fide adult with a 9-to-5, I’m perplexed as to how—and where—to wear it. Anklets’ beachy connotations leave them feeling ill-fit for the office—let alone any semi-fancy affair, like a party or nice dinner. But I’ve reached a simple conclusion: Anklets are simply too fun to overthink. They’re abundantly on offer in every fast-fashion retailer imaginable, they’re priced competitively, and they’refun. They still make me feel cool and fashion-forward, even if I haven’t figured out their best sartorial application. And they still transport me—just in a slightly different way. Instead of making me feel like my toes are in the sand, they make me feel like my toes are in the fluffy carpet that lined the floors of the house where I grew up—or in a pair of jelly sandals, following my mom’s grocery cart as she darted from aisle to aisle at Kroger.Nostalgia is a beautiful thing.

"The Cutest Ways To Say 'I'm Vaxxed, Not Anti-Mask' This Summer","These ain’t your grandma’s pearls! The pearl jewelry trend blowing up this season is all about adding modern twists to the classic strand. We’re talking statement earrings, mismatched sizes and plenty of stackable rings. After tons of pearls were spotted at the inauguration ceremony this week, I realized just how badly I wanted a strand of my own. The second I typed “pearls” into Google, though, hundreds of options popped up. I should have figured that just about everyone in the world would want some, too.Pearls are often typecast as stuffy, but the look received a revival via TikTok when Gen-Z fashion gurus started showing off their Vivienne Westwood necklaces as the finishing touch to their cool-girl vintage ‘fits. The VW versions retail for hundreds of dollars and are pretty much sold out everywhere at the moment, but there are tons of other trendy brands selling pearls right now to consider. Brands like Mejuri, Missoma and Maison Irem sell alternatives that I can actually afford and totally love, so it looks like I’ll be purchasing more than a few pieces this season.Surprisingly, real pearls on their own aren’t all that expensive, so this use this trend as the perfect excuse to treat yourself without breaking the bank. Whether you opt for a string of real pearls or go for an authentic-looking (and cheaper) imitation version, you’re gonna want to wear these pieces with everything.Keep reading if you’re ready to think of this classic style in a whole new light.

"2018 Might Be Long Gone, but Coin Jewelry Isn't","As someone who was never an avid jewelry wearer growing up (I also attribute this to my horrible taste in fashion — early 2000s kids will know), I’ll be the first to admit that when I heard of using jewelry as an heirloom, I was a bit confused. I mean, why not leave me a house or better yet, a briefcase full of cash? But then I received a present from my mother for Christmas. It was a ring and I was instantly in love — it’s also a much more practical gift than a briefcase of cash. I thought to myself, this is a ring I will wear forever, as it’s simple, classy, and timeless. So timeless in fact that I thought, “this is a staple piece I could hopefully pass down to my future kids.”Passing down jewelry from generation to generation is not a new concept, but it is one that I feel isn’t as prominent as it used to be. Maybe that’s because the jewelry trends have changed so much throughout the years, we wouldn’t be seen wearing something from the early 1900s. Or perhaps, you’re more inclined to wear vintage clothing rather than vintage jewelry (no judgment, here!). Either way, I am 100% prepared to make the case for why jewelry is the way to go when it comes to keeping something in the family. If you’re a skeptic, buckle up because, by the end of this article, I’ll make a jewelry heirloom believer out of you.It helps preserve memoriesOur loved ones unfortunately aren’t going to be around forever. Luckily, we have ways of remembering them, whether it be our memories, old photographs, the names we choose to give (I can attest to this as my middle name is my grandmother’s name), and of course, jewelry. If you consider yourself a fashionista already starting to think about your legacy and how you want future generations to remember you, passing down a timeless infinity bracelet will ensure you’re always known as “the one in the family who had great style.”Pandora.   Pandora Moments Infinity Knot Snake…$85     Buy Now Things always come back in styleLet’s face it — trends always come back in style. Round glasses? Check. Wide-leg pants? Check. Thin eyebrows? Check (unfortunately). My point is if you think those earrings you’re thinking of passing down won’t be in, come 20 years from now, chances are you’re mistaken. Trust me, I’ve seen firsthand how fashion has evolved over time and one thing’s for sure — fashion always makes a comeback. Take the Sparkling Halo Heart Hoop Earrings from Pandora for example. They’re giving me early 1900s Titanic Hope Diamond vibes and I am so here for it.Pandora.   Sparkling Halo Heart Hoop Earrings$115     Buy Now It’s practical andsentimentalJewelry is something we’ll actually wear if passed down (as opposed to a ball gown). Whether you’re going to work, a fancy event, or spending an evening out with friends, accessories are the perfect addition to an outfit. And if you’re wearing (or decide to pass down) a piece of jewelry to or from a family member, that piece will always hold some sentimental value. One practical, yet stylish Pandora jewelry piece is its Sparkling Tennis Bracelet. It makes the perfect gift for any occasion given its history dating back to the 80s, and one that anyone would be thrilled to wear for years.Pandora.   Sparkling Tennis Bracelet$115     Buy Now It’s valuableBecause it’s a family heirloom that is passed down, that means it only needs to be paid for by the initial wearer. It’s no secret that jewelry can get expensive (think thousands of dollars), which is why passing a piece down generations is a thoughtful gesture. The value of a certain accessory can also go up over time so you’ll definitely want to get something that’s worth every penny like Pandora’s gold-plated Sparkling Round Halo Ring.Pandora.   Sparkling Round Halo Ring$115     Buy Now You can make something new from itFun fact: any piece of jewelry can be repurposed or redesigned into a brand new piece. So, if you’re looking to make your grandmother’s old diamond earrings into a ring, or earrings into a necklace, it is possible. If not, there are plenty of jewelers out there who know how to clean and repair old items. Until then, enjoy the staple pieces like these 14k gold-plated stud earrings with clear cubic zirconia while you can until you pass them on for the next person in your family to wear.Pandora.   Sparkling Round Halo Stud Earrings$115     Buy Now It always makes the perfect giftWhether you’re passing down a piece of jewelry for Mother’s Day, a birthday, or just because, accessories are always a great way to show the style icon in your life how much you love them.

5 Jewelry Trends For This Season You Won't Want to Miss,"Giving your children piercings and other body modifications is a tricky topic for lots of people—meaning even Kylie Jenner gets mom-shamed for Stormi’s hoop earrings. The Keeping Up With the Kardashiansstar debuted baby Stormi’s latest look on the ‘gram, only to be met with a barrage of criticism over the hoops. Clearly, plenty of these commenters never had their ears pierced as babies (a practice that is commonplace inmanycultures and communities). Or even if they did; some appear to just be trolling the star and her daughter, for hate’s sake.The toddler, who recently celebrated her second birthday with Kylie and dad Travis Scott, didn’t seem bothered. Yet concerned citizens weighed in via Instagram’s comments section, levying cries of abuse and Stormi acting too “grown-up” for these big, bad hoops (which, lest we forget to mention, are even personalized with her name).One user went so far as to suggest that Stormi could face undeserved criticism for looking “ghetto” with these earrings. “lil sis this little baby is cute… however she’s too young for earrings this size…” wrote Instagram user @antoniamoore9229.“From a mother of another black girl…we don’t put earrings on our little girls that size and style because we don’t want people to talk about our kids in negative ways…and calling our children ghetto,” the user added. “she’s an adorable little girl…please save the earrings for her until she’s 12 or 15 years old.” Um.         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Kylie 🤍 (@kyliejenner)We’re going to chalk that one up to a difference in perspectives. What weshouldbe weighing in on is why anyone would term Black jewelry trends as “ghetto” in the first place, whether or not they’re on a baby (this writer from the Bronx wore hoops as young as Stormi, thank you very much).

"Layer Up, Kids—The Top 2022 Jewelry Trends Are Here","As anyone with an Instagram knows all too well, coin jewelry pervaded the zeitgeist in 2018. Celebrities and “it” girls, alike, adorned their necks with lightweight metal discs meant to look like money—breathing new life into the layered jewelry trend that’s endured for years on end. Though the shell jewelry movement threatened to upend coin jewelry’s reign, it turns out the two aren’t mutually exclusive, after all. Both coin jewelry and shell jewelry are making their way into 2019—offering us a veritable plethora of statement jewelry to choose from.This summer’s coin jewelry trend isn’t the far cry from last year’s you might expect. Coin pendants still abound, leaving minimalists with plenty of ways into the continued trend. But 2019’s coin jewelry movement has seen some maximalist remixes, too. Heavy coin chokers are on offer—so are lengthy chain necklaces, crafted from coin-covered string upon coin-covered string. Now that the aughts have crept into our day-to-day, coin belts are seeing some traction too. As are coin statement earrings—and layered necklaces that capitalize on both the coin jewelry trend and its competitor, the shell jewelry trend, at once.All this is to say: Your favorite retailers have ensured that it’s never too late to hop aboard the coin jewelry bandwagon. If last year’s trend came and went before you had a chance to wrap your sartorial mind around it, you’re in luck, because you still have a whopping season (who knows—maybe even more) to embrace coin jewelry in all its shiny glory.1.

5 Summer Jewelry Trends That Work From The Beach To Happy Hour,"You’ve slipped on your favorite dress, slid on a pair of kitten heels, and slicked your hair back into the perfect bun. You’re almost ready to walk out the door but your look is missing one major thing: details. Whether you identify with the “less is more” or “more is more” school of thought regarding fashion, both parties can agree that the best outfits include some kind of accessory. Summer’s jewelry trends have been solidified (and spoiler alert: they’ll easily last through the fall) and they’re just what you need to add that extra dazzling detail to your outfit.One of my favorite things about jewelry trends is that they aren’t as volatile as fashion trends. High-quality jewelry usually has sentimental value and also often comes with a higher price tag. This means that jewelry trends stick around for a more extended period of time because people aren’t looking to part ways with their favorite pieces.I take the personal approach of investing in my everyday staples like a simple gold chain, studs, or name initial ring and then letting myself have fun with less expensive costume jewelry. I also think finding inspiration from your friends and family is helpful. For example, my mom has a gold coin jewelry set that she’s worn throughout the last 20 years. The set makes a statement and has never gone out of style—I always admire the look of it when she wears it so I’d be willing to invest in a similar piece!The top jewelry trends this summer fall into the investment and trend categories. For example, the chain link necklaces, sleek silver hoops, and floral jewelry all have incredible longevity. If they tire out at any point, you know they’ll always eventually come back. On the trendier end, we have charm bracelets and initial necklaces. Both of these trends are meant to be customized which makes them great gift options—fashion is always more fun when you can share it with a friend.iMaxTree.1. FloralsFlorals are often associated with summer dresses or the tablescape at a dinner party, but the trend is in full bloom in the accessories sphere. Floral earrings are especially having a moment and are a fun twist on the whimsical look of tucking a flower behind your ear. The style works with statement earrings, flower-encrusted hoops or bracelet charms.iMaxTree.2. Sleek Silver HoopsOk if you haven’t caught on by now, all the hot girls and guys are wearing silver hoops. Big or small, stacked or single, silver hoops are still the coolest thing you can put in your ears (sorry Airpods). Feel free to mix metals and add a combination of silver and gold to your ear stack.iMaxTree.3. Chain Link NecklacesYou’re going to want to link up with this jewelry trend—literally. Chain link necklaces are the perfect everyday accessory and can be customized to your lifestyle. For example, I wear two delicate link chain necklaces every day that add subtle detail to my outfitsandI don’t have to take them on and off to sleep, shower, etc. You can choose how heavy you want the metal to be, how many you want to layer and if you want to add charms to your stack.iMaxTree.4. Initial JewelryJewelry is so personal and the initial and name jewelry trend proves it! Wearing a customizable name necklace, initial ring or both is a fun way to make a “this is me!” statement. Initial jewelry can also be a meaningful way to show your connection to someone else—whether it’s your significant other, parent or child’s initials, adding a piece to your collection will keep them close to you all day.Getty Images.5. Charm BraceletsCharm bracelets are back and better than ever. Tap into early 2000’s nostalgia with a decked-out charm bracelet on your wrist. Charms are a fun way to show off your niche interests, give your friend a meaningful gift, celebrate a memory or create a #twinning moment. "
"Five 2021 Jewelry Trends To Invest In, From Pendants To Pearls"," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.It’s easy to get caught up in revamping your wardrobe to fit the season’s latest trends. But between the cut-outs, faux fur coats, low-rise jeans, and dip-dye, the fashion trends may begin to seem overwhelming when the outfit options become endless. When you’re standing in the dressing room of Zara trying to determine which item to purchase, let me remind you that jewelry is often what makes and completes an outfit. So keep your fashion simple, grab your favorite black sweater or white button-down and shift your energy to focus on the jewelry trends for 2023. From simple silver hoops to bold bangles, there’s a jewelry trend to add a little extra flair to any look.While clothing always tells a story, jewelry is considered to be more personal. You may already have a signature piece that you wear every day or something with deep sentimental value. Oftentimes, these personally valuable pieces lean on the side of individual taste more than a trend, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do both. The best part of jewelry? Layers, stacks and statements pieces. The hardest part is picking which pieces to pair together!I interviewed jewelry designer and curator, Stephanie Gottlieb, for an expert opinion on how to play into 2023’s biggest jewelry moments and the key to finding a balance between trendy and timeless.First and foremost, if you’re looking to invest in your personal jewelry collection, it’s best to prioritize purchasing pieces that will maintain quality and value.“I always recommend for a new buyer to start with the classics like diamond studs, a tennis bracelet, or a diamond stack bands and then if you’re wanting to introduce the trendy pieces do that after you’ve already built the wardrobe of the staples,” Gottlieb advises. But when it comes to trendy pieces, Gottlieb says the opposite, “Buy costume to start and upgrade over time as the budget allows. You can sprinkle in less expensive fashion-forward trendy pieces.”Tom Ford; iMaxTree.Her advice seems simple enough—invest in quality, play with quantity! Luckily, 2023’s jewelry trends give you the opportunity to do a bit of both. Classic silver and gold pieces aren’t going anywhere—if anything, they’re getting more popular. If you’ve already built a collection of Hailey Bieber-inspired gold hoops (I sure know I have), consider mixing in some silver metal and vice versa. Don’t be afraid to upgrade your classic metals but simply goingbigger.According to Gottlieb, “We’re going to see a big comeback of the ‘80s and still some of the ‘90s. Think lots of chunky gold jewelry, big hoops and geometric shapes.” Based on the Spring/Summer ‘23 runway shows, Gottlieb is spot on.Keep reading for the five biggest jewelry trends expected to shine throughout 2023 (hey, it’s never too early to start wearing them!).Tory Burch; Jonathan Simkhai, iMaxTree.Totally CuffedA silver or gold cuff is the perfect example of a way to make a subtle statement with just one piece. Cuff bracelets are proving themselves to be the easiest way to elevate any look. The silhouette is often just a thick, arched curve but the impact is big! For starters, cuffs are usually adjustable which means you can wear them in multiple ways. If you prefer a classic look, add a cuff (or two) around your wrist to shine under the sleeve of your shirt or sweater. To make the trend more interesting, slip the cuff up your forearm like the models wore at Missoni, or opt for a wrap-around cuff as seen on the models at Tory Burch.Courtesy of Banana Republic.Hammered Cuff BraceletThis silver cuff has a wave structure to it which will help reflect light and make it super eye-catching. Plus, it’s only $30 so it’s a great way to try out to trend without feeling handcuffed to it.

Pair it with a strapless or slip dress to add dimension to your look.   Four Row Cuff$98     Buy Now Jil Sander; Missoni, iMaxTree.Superior SilverGold has been associated with first place for long enough, it’s silver’s time to shine. Oversized silver statement hoops were a staple on the spring/summer ’23 runway and the second I saw Bella Hadid wear them during the Jil Sander show, I was sold. I’m putting my bets in now that she repeats the silver hoops for a street-style moment. Oversized silver hoops are another ’80s trend but they look incredibly modern when paired with 2023’s runway trends. For everyday wear, consider downsizing the hoop size (your ears will thank you) and leave the big guys for special occasions.Courtesy of Stephanie Gottlieb.35mm Tube Hoop EarringsIf you plan on wearing a pair of earrings on a daily basis, it’s definitely worth investing in a pair that won’t irritate your ears or tarnish. This pair of tube hoops by Stephanie Gottlieb are actually made with 14k white gold and are well worth the higher price point.   35mm Tube Hoop Earrings $520     Buy Now Courtesy of Zara.Rectangular EarringsSometimes it’s just easier to go with a faux-hoop (aka stud).

Whether you’re stacking multiple strands of the same beads, mixing and matching, or just letting a singular strand speak for itself, this boho trend is a casual way to accessorize. Take notes from Blumarine, the totally Y2 K-inspired brand, and add a charm to a beaded strand, or get inspired by Coach’s quirky decision to add unusual objects to a long strand like a sports whistle. You don’t need to wear a flower crown or long skirt for beads to work with your outfit.Courtesy of Nordstrom.Carabiner Beaded NecklaceSpeaking of unconventional objects, this beaded necklace comes with an adorable carabiner charm and makes the perfect gift for an outdoorsy friend.

Well, we’re bringing the essence of the trend back in a significantly less-cringy way with dangly boho earrings.

13 Ways To Start Wearing Spring's Enamel Jewelry Trend Right Now," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.I’m very lucky because my mom is a total fashion icon. When we go shopping together, we almost always leave with matching fashion finds. For this reason, the mother-daughter matching jewelry trend is perfect.I’ve been stealing her clothes, bags and jewelry for as long as I can remember and incorporating them into my own wardrobe. I even got caught trying to bring some of her items to college with me (my mission was unsuccessful). I love the idea of coordinating jewelry because it’s a way to bring everyday sentimental value to both of our looks. It also saves us from being too matchy-matchy and doubles our options (because we obviously still swap pieces).Coordinating jewelry, especially in a mother-daughter sense, doesn’t need to feel like a gimmick. Don’t get me wrong, I was a huge fan of matching friendship bracelets and half-heart necklaces as a kid but I want my grown-up jewelry to feel a little more elevated.Now I look for easy ways to build continuity between our collections. One way this can be done is by focusing on a motif, like the stars or the moon, and finding pieces within that theme. I also love the idea of choosing a stone or jewel and finding jewelry that features the same element.AP Images.Zoë Kravitz and her mom Lisa Bonet do an incredible job of coordinating jewelry in a way that still speaks to their individual personal styles. Kravitz’s gold earrings and body chain compliment Bonet’s bird brooch on her collar and gold hoops.A lot of jewelry brands also have signature styles that they incorporate throughout most of their pieces. By shopping for jewelry from the same brand, there’s a good chance that the design elements will be consistent throughout—you can take a brand’s signature style and make it one you and your mom are known for wearing.AP Images.If being subtle isn’t your thing, take a page out of Kris and Khloe Kardashian’s book and go bold. The Kardashian duo not only wore bright diamond earrings, but coordinated their twisted glitter dresses. This is a fun way to make sure everyone is aware of family ties at functions.Whether you’re pairing earrings and bracelets or rings and necklaces, mother-daughter jewelry is so sweet and sentimental. Mother’s Day is also quickly approaching so this is a great way to get your mom and yourself (for the sake of the trend of course) something special.Keep reading for my favorite coordinating picks.A Pearl PairPerhaps the most classic way to coordinate with your mom is by wearing complementary sets of pearls. Pearl jewelry is a staple of sophisticated style but can also allude to the more carefree fashion of the 1920s. Pearls are currently having a modern resurgence and are being incorporated into heavy chain necklaces, huggie earrings or other gem clusters. This means that even if you are a die-hard Y2K grunge-girl and your mom prefers a classic strand, you can still coordinate jewelry and have a meaningful connection.To The Moon & BackIf you’re into astrology or just love spending a long night under the stars, moon and star-themed jewelry is a great way to connect with your mom and the great unknown. Stars are super on-trend for jewelry right now so it’s easy to find celestial gems to wear. One of you can sport a crescent moon necklace while the other wears sparkly star earring studs (or vice versa) to stick with the theme. If you want to get multiple siblings in on the look, a moon and star charm bracelet is also a fun option for everyone to wear.Diamonds Are Your Mom’s Best FriendYou don’t have to have an heirloom engagement ring to connect to your family with diamonds. Diamonds come in all shapes and sizes which makes them easy to personalize and fun to mix and match. A matching pair of small diamond studs are great for everyday wear and will be a subtle daily reminder of your mom. Having different pieces in the same shape or setting is another way to have a subtle #twinning moment. Diamonds are also available in moissanite and lab-grown alternatives so you don’t have to break the bank to participate. "

"This Spring, Shell Pendants Might Just Replace Last Year’s Coin Jewelry Obsession","I’m the type of gal who sticks to a few gold earrings or a simple gold chain and calls it a day, so I never thought I would be one to gravitate toward colorful jewelry. But if 2021 has taught me anything so far, it’s that I should probably branch out and try new things, and my newfound color obsession is making it that easy. Case in point: I have (somehow) fallen head over heels for the enamel jewelry trendthat has been taking over my social media feeds. Luckily for me, these rainbow-brite pieces don’t seem to be going away anytime soon.It all started when I spotted a pair of Mejuri’s enamel hoops while aimlessly browsing the web the other night and instantly fell in love.

Now, I’ve found tons of different options at literally every price point imaginable, and they’re all sitting in my cart waiting for me to pull the proverbial trigger and place a slew of orders.So, I’ve rounded up 13 of my favorite pieces of enamel jewelry to share with you, in hopes that I won’t be the only one impulse-shopping. And when I say these price points are good, I mean it!

Kitschy Fruit Jewelry Is All Over Instagram & I'm Fully Embracing It,"Our opportunities to experiment with style took a massive hit over the last year, but the accessories we chose to wear while working from home were our saving grace. I seriously miss the days prior to then where I could put on “real” pants and deck myself out in every blingy earring, bracelet and necklace in my jewelry box. Now that we’re starting to go out and about again, hopefully, Mejuri’s brand-new enamel rings can help me get a handle on some of 2021’s biggest jewelry trends.I once thought colorful jewelry was a thing of the past. Sure, I used to stack on bright bangles and plastic rings when I played dress-up as a kid, but I’ve opted for wearing more understated pieces made from gold or silver since becoming a real adult. That said, it looks like Mejuri is officially making colors cool again with their new selection of enamel pieces, and I’m surprisingly here for it. The collection includes two ring styles and a pair of hoop earrings that come in shades of green, brown and blue. If you’re a true magpie at heart, don’t fret—these enamel pieces are adorned with a single shiny stone in the center for an added blingy bonus.All trends really do end up coming back around. Similar to the pearl jewelry craze that took over my Instagram feed last month and revived the look I once considered stuffy and outdated, enamel is being completely reinvented in 2021. In Mejuri’s collection, the colors are more understated rather than bold or intense, so they’ll play well with your favorite metallic pieces and chunky gold chains. Just like everything else Mejuri sells, these rings are just bold enough to make a statement.Add a few of these rings into your collection for a playful pop of color this season.

Hailey Bieber's Gold Body Chain Makes Her Bikini Look Even Hotter,"While some look to the runways to see what all the models are wearing on their bodies, I’m more interested in what they’ve got on their ears. And on their fingers, and around their necks—do you see where I’m going with this? Earrings, rings and necklaces are the keys to my heart, and lucky for me, all the 2020 jewelry trends are full-on obsession-worthy.Designers like Christian Siriano made a case for chunky, punk-inspired chains, while others, like Ulla Johnson and Zimmermann, showed off more playful looks like fun mismatched earrings and charm necklaces, respectively. There’s no shortage of statement jewelry calling my name this season, and I can’t wait to pair all these trends with cozy fall and winter ensembles.One of the best parts about jewelry is that it has the ability to elevate any outfit. Wearing a white tee and jeans? Add a chunky gold chain necklace or some fun dangly earrings and suddenly it’s a whole lewk. Unsure of how to wear your favorite LBD this season? Just add some statement jewelry (in either colorful hues or classics like gold and silver) and spice things up a bit.

Why Jewelry Is the Best Staple Piece to Pass Down Generations,"Sure, diamond rings and classic pendant necklace—from lockets to shell-adorned chokers, and everything in between— is definitely jewelry staples that every accessory lover should own at least one of in their personal collection, but if you’re looking to add a bit of either edge of elegance to your look, embellishing your wrist with statement arm candy is your best bet for looking subtle yet adding a little something extra to help refine your overall look. Chunky, chain bracelets are a classic option that transcends the fickle cycle of jewelry trends, and they always somehow manage to look both chic and bold without coming across as over-the-top, super-trendy, or downright gaudy.Whether you prefer a braided silver-toned style or a slimmer gold-toned bracelet, these wrist upgrades have the power to add that ambiguous yet all too common, “something’s missing” touch to your outfit with just one signature piece.

Kylie Jenner Is Fielding Criticism Over Baby Girl Stormi's Personalized Hoop Earrings,"It’s hardly a stretch to make the argument that last year’s biggest overarching jewelry trend was the Instagram-famous coin necklace, endorsed by countless influencers, style editors and street style stars alike. It makes sense that this classic jewelry style went remarkably viral, as coin necklaces offer the utmost versatility, thanks to their infinitely stackable appeal (the coin and nameplate duo have remained a popular layering combo)—punctuated, of course, by their inherently vintage charm. This spring, though, there’s a new influencer-approved jewelry trend on the block: seashell jewelry.Not only are gilded seashell-shaped designs cropping up as adornments on necklaces, but the resort-ready motif is also a dominant embellishment for rings, statement earrings and hair accessories this season. Even ’90s-era puka shells are coming back to life in modernized jewelry styles that—don’t worry—aren’t exact replicas of the throwback styles beloved by teenage surfers of decades’ past.Before you begin to cringe at this beachy trend’s somewhat startling resurrection, know that today’s puka-imbued jewelry has been revised with polished updates that prevent the designs from looking like an artifact of ’90s ska culture—or some overpriced souvenir purchased at the hotel gift shop during your childhood family vacation. And, if you still need further proof that the unlikely style’s return to fashion is, in fact, a thing, look to none other than Gigi Hadid, who was spotted sporting a puka choker during Paris Fashion Week.Of course, if you can’t even entertain the idea of bringing back the vacation-inspired chokers of your youth, there are plenty of other shell-designed iterations of this under-the-sea trend that feel a bit more refined. Traditional conch shell designs, spiraling shark eyes, and sophisticated sand dollars with opalescent finishes feel more sophisticated (and office-appropriate) than kitsch or novel.And let’s be clear about one thing: last year’s coin necklaces are a timeless, ultra-wearable jewelry piece, so we’re certainly not writing them off as a thing of the past. But if you’ve grown tired of the endlessly ubiquitous coin trend, opt for one of these fresh, under-the-sea (and summer-ready) alternatives, instead.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

Hailey Bieber's Go-To Choker Is More Than 50% Off & We're Shocked It Hasn't Sold Out Yet,"I’ve never had a particularly kitschy fashion sense, but lately, accessorizing with a bit of whimsy just brings me joy—hence why I’m leaning into 2020’s fruit jewelry trend so damn hard. Somewhere between the cottagecore/picnic aesthetic and the classic Girl Next Door exists a perfect blend of the two: The Girl Next Door Who Owns Too Many Plants, Has A Window Sill Garden & Wears Fruit Jewelry. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m happy to announce that I am she. She is me. We are one.But to be clear, I’m not the only one in love with the look. After luxury brands like Mercedes Salazar debuted fun, fruity accessories for summer (I’ve been dreaming about their Tropics Strawberry Earrings for months) and Insta-famous brands like Et Toi Paris littered my Explore Page with cutesy fruitsy jewelry, it seemed the trend was everywhere—and don’t even get me started about the amount of fruit jewelry on Etsy. It’s not to be believed, y’all. Whether or not you think a salad complements your meal, a fruit-themed accessory can and will complement your outfit, so don’t hesitate to try the trend out.Bella Gerard.My personal recommendation for cute statement fruit jewelry that doesn’t look cheesy? I’ve been lovingUK-based brand I’MMANY London‘s Summer Capsule ’20, full of strawberries, grapes and the like. I’MMANY’s collection is about as chic as produce-themed jewelry can get, and the star of the show are undoubtedly their wide array of cherry earrings. You can shop single-drop stems or two-cherry earrings, and choose from a classic red hue to more playful colorways like iridescent lilac, pink and light gray.Bella Gerard.   Double Cherry Drop Earrings$124.60     Buy Now Besides the gold-plated brass brass stems, the coloring on theDouble Cherry Drop Earringslooks so realistic—like, it almost looks as if I went to the grocery store and Michael’s and DIY’d these babies myself. While cherries can sometimes look a little too retro or kitschy, these are actually super classy, and I especially love the idea of pairing them with an all-white outfit, a reddish lip stain and some faux freckles for good measure.Bella Gerard.   Red StrawberryHuggie Hoop Earring$56.64     Buy Now A slightly smaller statement that’s just as sweet is theRed StrawberryHuggie Hoop Earring, sold singular so that you can mix and match with I’MMANY’s other huggie hoops, should you choose to. Fruit jewelry is already as bold as I’ll go, so I played it safe with two red strawberries, but there are also sweet little leaves and berries of all sorts of colors to choose from. My favorite part? That itty-bitty pearl detail at the top, of course.Bella Gerard.If you’re ready to spice up your neutral summer wardrobe with a few statement accessories, the fruit jewelry trend is the move, and I can’t recommend I’MMANY London’s selection enough. Did I mention they also have a Garden Society Collection full of even more produce? Suddenly, I’m in need of a red pepper necklace and a lettuce leaf charm bracelet.

"The Cutest Ways To Say 'I'm Vaxxed, Not Anti-Mask' This Summer","There are few celebs I admire more than Hailey Bieber when it comes to off-duty style. I honestly can’t think of a time when I didn’t want to copy something she’s worn—and if her Instagram feed is any indication, it looks like Bieber is ready to serve up inspo for my entire summer wardrobe, especiallymy beach outfits! The model just posted a pic in the most delicate gold body chain and I’m obsessed with her take on styling body jewelry for 2021.ICYMI: It’s May, people! Summer is here and no one is more ready for warm weather than Hailey Bieber. I mean, she’s already showing off her bikini collection on the ‘gram and I’m taking detailed notes! Her most recent post featured a baby pink string bikini from TRIANGL paired with the real star of the show, a glimmering body chain by Jacquie Aiche styled with two coordinating diamond necklaces. She topped off her look with a pair of chunky gold hoop earrings and a few Y2K-inspired mini ponytails around the crown of her head. Yup, copying this look ASAP!         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Hailey Rhode Baldwin Bieber (@haileybieber)If the words “body chain” traumatize you, fear not. These are not the chunky waist chains of the early aughts! Bieber’s version is of a far more delicate nature, which feels much more modern and chic. It also makes the accessory more wearable in my eyes. You can style it like she did over a bikini or wear it under any number of crop tops for some added glitz. Forget other jewelry trends of the season: This summer is all about the beachy body bling.Bieber’s chain was covered in diamonds and costs more than a few thousand bucks, so no, it’s not exactly affordable. But you can still get the look for less! I was able to source a few inexpensive options for you to buy right now if you are trying to copy her blingy bikini vibes. Each of the body chains below retail for under $15 bucks; read on to snag one for yourself.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

"2018 Might Be Long Gone, but Coin Jewelry Isn't","When I was a wee elementary schooler, nothing—and I meannothing—made me feel as cool as I did when I wore an anklet. The early-aughts anklets trend empowered me to feel like a beach beauty and badass surfer girl rolled into one. As I lived in middle Tennessee, I was basically never wearing an anklet on or near the beach (or really, anywhere other than Kroger or Target). But I feltcool. I felttransported. I felt like the kind of fashion-forward 8-year-old I knew I was every time I spent hours styling and re-styling my Polly Pocket dolls. 2019’s take on the anklets trend has basically left me feeling the exact same way.These days, my time outdoors is no longer spent near-exclusively at Kroger and Target. And my time spent indoors is no longer spent near-exclusively styling Polly Pocket dolls. (Don’t fret—I’ve been sans Polly Pocket since middle school. You are not reading a fashion story penned by a 25-year-old who still plays with dolls.) I am still in middle Tennessee, so decidedly far from basically any beach—leaving me anything but a beach beauty or badass surfer girl (or some endlessly cool hybrid of the two). I’m an editor who spends her days writing in coffeeshops, working out at the YMCA and—when I’m feeling fancy—eating at Nashville’s trendiest restaurants. None of these settings lend themselves particularly well to anklets, especially now that I’m a 25-year-old with a full-time job andnot an elementary schooler who can basically wear anything she damn well pleases.It’s been challenging, then, for me to wrap my head around the 2019 anklet renaissance. As a fan of basically every retro revival to hit the zeitgeist, I’m predisposed to love it. But as a bona fide adult with a 9-to-5, I’m perplexed as to how—and where—to wear it. Anklets’ beachy connotations leave them feeling ill-fit for the office—let alone any semi-fancy affair, like a party or nice dinner. But I’ve reached a simple conclusion: Anklets are simply too fun to overthink. They’re abundantly on offer in every fast-fashion retailer imaginable, they’re priced competitively, and they’refun. They still make me feel cool and fashion-forward, even if I haven’t figured out their best sartorial application. And they still transport me—just in a slightly different way. Instead of making me feel like my toes are in the sand, they make me feel like my toes are in the fluffy carpet that lined the floors of the house where I grew up—or in a pair of jelly sandals, following my mom’s grocery cart as she darted from aisle to aisle at Kroger.Nostalgia is a beautiful thing.

5 Upcoming Fall Fashion Trends That Are Actually Groundbreaking,"These ain’t your grandma’s pearls! The pearl jewelry trend blowing up this season is all about adding modern twists to the classic strand. We’re talking statement earrings, mismatched sizes and plenty of stackable rings. After tons of pearls were spotted at the inauguration ceremony this week, I realized just how badly I wanted a strand of my own. The second I typed “pearls” into Google, though, hundreds of options popped up. I should have figured that just about everyone in the world would want some, too.Pearls are often typecast as stuffy, but the look received a revival via TikTok when Gen-Z fashion gurus started showing off their Vivienne Westwood necklaces as the finishing touch to their cool-girl vintage ‘fits. The VW versions retail for hundreds of dollars and are pretty much sold out everywhere at the moment, but there are tons of other trendy brands selling pearls right now to consider. Brands like Mejuri, Missoma and Maison Irem sell alternatives that I can actually afford and totally love, so it looks like I’ll be purchasing more than a few pieces this season.Surprisingly, real pearls on their own aren’t all that expensive, so this use this trend as the perfect excuse to treat yourself without breaking the bank. Whether you opt for a string of real pearls or go for an authentic-looking (and cheaper) imitation version, you’re gonna want to wear these pieces with everything.Keep reading if you’re ready to think of this classic style in a whole new light.

10 Summer Camp Jewelry Pieces That Make You Look Craftier Than You Are,"As someone who was never an avid jewelry wearer growing up (I also attribute this to my horrible taste in fashion — early 2000s kids will know), I’ll be the first to admit that when I heard of using jewelry as an heirloom, I was a bit confused. I mean, why not leave me a house or better yet, a briefcase full of cash? But then I received a present from my mother for Christmas. It was a ring and I was instantly in love — it’s also a much more practical gift than a briefcase of cash. I thought to myself, this is a ring I will wear forever, as it’s simple, classy, and timeless. So timeless in fact that I thought, “this is a staple piece I could hopefully pass down to my future kids.”Passing down jewelry from generation to generation is not a new concept, but it is one that I feel isn’t as prominent as it used to be. Maybe that’s because the jewelry trends have changed so much throughout the years, we wouldn’t be seen wearing something from the early 1900s. Or perhaps, you’re more inclined to wear vintage clothing rather than vintage jewelry (no judgment, here!). Either way, I am 100% prepared to make the case for why jewelry is the way to go when it comes to keeping something in the family. If you’re a skeptic, buckle up because, by the end of this article, I’ll make a jewelry heirloom believer out of you.It helps preserve memoriesOur loved ones unfortunately aren’t going to be around forever. Luckily, we have ways of remembering them, whether it be our memories, old photographs, the names we choose to give (I can attest to this as my middle name is my grandmother’s name), and of course, jewelry. If you consider yourself a fashionista already starting to think about your legacy and how you want future generations to remember you, passing down a timeless infinity bracelet will ensure you’re always known as “the one in the family who had great style.”Pandora.   Pandora Moments Infinity Knot Snake…$85     Buy Now Things always come back in styleLet’s face it — trends always come back in style. Round glasses? Check. Wide-leg pants? Check. Thin eyebrows? Check (unfortunately). My point is if you think those earrings you’re thinking of passing down won’t be in, come 20 years from now, chances are you’re mistaken. Trust me, I’ve seen firsthand how fashion has evolved over time and one thing’s for sure — fashion always makes a comeback. Take the Sparkling Halo Heart Hoop Earrings from Pandora for example. They’re giving me early 1900s Titanic Hope Diamond vibes and I am so here for it.Pandora.   Sparkling Halo Heart Hoop Earrings$115     Buy Now It’s practical andsentimentalJewelry is something we’ll actually wear if passed down (as opposed to a ball gown). Whether you’re going to work, a fancy event, or spending an evening out with friends, accessories are the perfect addition to an outfit. And if you’re wearing (or decide to pass down) a piece of jewelry to or from a family member, that piece will always hold some sentimental value. One practical, yet stylish Pandora jewelry piece is its Sparkling Tennis Bracelet. It makes the perfect gift for any occasion given its history dating back to the 80s, and one that anyone would be thrilled to wear for years.Pandora.   Sparkling Tennis Bracelet$115     Buy Now It’s valuableBecause it’s a family heirloom that is passed down, that means it only needs to be paid for by the initial wearer. It’s no secret that jewelry can get expensive (think thousands of dollars), which is why passing a piece down generations is a thoughtful gesture. The value of a certain accessory can also go up over time so you’ll definitely want to get something that’s worth every penny like Pandora’s gold-plated Sparkling Round Halo Ring.Pandora.   Sparkling Round Halo Ring$115     Buy Now You can make something new from itFun fact: any piece of jewelry can be repurposed or redesigned into a brand new piece. So, if you’re looking to make your grandmother’s old diamond earrings into a ring, or earrings into a necklace, it is possible. If not, there are plenty of jewelers out there who know how to clean and repair old items. Until then, enjoy the staple pieces like these 14k gold-plated stud earrings with clear cubic zirconia while you can until you pass them on for the next person in your family to wear.Pandora.   Sparkling Round Halo Stud Earrings$115     Buy Now It always makes the perfect giftWhether you’re passing down a piece of jewelry for Mother’s Day, a birthday, or just because, accessories are always a great way to show the style icon in your life how much you love them.

Your Love of All Things Tropical Can Officially Extend into the Jewelry Sphere,"Giving your children piercings and other body modifications is a tricky topic for lots of people—meaning even Kylie Jenner gets mom-shamed for Stormi’s hoop earrings. The Keeping Up With the Kardashiansstar debuted baby Stormi’s latest look on the ‘gram, only to be met with a barrage of criticism over the hoops. Clearly, plenty of these commenters never had their ears pierced as babies (a practice that is commonplace inmanycultures and communities). Or even if they did; some appear to just be trolling the star and her daughter, for hate’s sake.The toddler, who recently celebrated her second birthday with Kylie and dad Travis Scott, didn’t seem bothered. Yet concerned citizens weighed in via Instagram’s comments section, levying cries of abuse and Stormi acting too “grown-up” for these big, bad hoops (which, lest we forget to mention, are even personalized with her name).One user went so far as to suggest that Stormi could face undeserved criticism for looking “ghetto” with these earrings. “lil sis this little baby is cute… however she’s too young for earrings this size…” wrote Instagram user @antoniamoore9229.“From a mother of another black girl…we don’t put earrings on our little girls that size and style because we don’t want people to talk about our kids in negative ways…and calling our children ghetto,” the user added. “she’s an adorable little girl…please save the earrings for her until she’s 12 or 15 years old.” Um.         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Kylie 🤍 (@kyliejenner)We’re going to chalk that one up to a difference in perspectives. What weshouldbe weighing in on is why anyone would term Black jewelry trends as “ghetto” in the first place, whether or not they’re on a baby (this writer from the Bronx wore hoops as young as Stormi, thank you very much).

"Name Jewelry Is Having a Moment, Because Carrie Bradshaw Is a Forever Fashion Icon","As anyone with an Instagram knows all too well, coin jewelry pervaded the zeitgeist in 2018. Celebrities and “it” girls, alike, adorned their necks with lightweight metal discs meant to look like money—breathing new life into the layered jewelry trend that’s endured for years on end. Though the shell jewelry movement threatened to upend coin jewelry’s reign, it turns out the two aren’t mutually exclusive, after all. Both coin jewelry and shell jewelry are making their way into 2019—offering us a veritable plethora of statement jewelry to choose from.This summer’s coin jewelry trend isn’t the far cry from last year’s you might expect. Coin pendants still abound, leaving minimalists with plenty of ways into the continued trend. But 2019’s coin jewelry movement has seen some maximalist remixes, too. Heavy coin chokers are on offer—so are lengthy chain necklaces, crafted from coin-covered string upon coin-covered string. Now that the aughts have crept into our day-to-day, coin belts are seeing some traction too. As are coin statement earrings—and layered necklaces that capitalize on both the coin jewelry trend and its competitor, the shell jewelry trend, at once.All this is to say: Your favorite retailers have ensured that it’s never too late to hop aboard the coin jewelry bandwagon. If last year’s trend came and went before you had a chance to wrap your sartorial mind around it, you’re in luck, because you still have a whopping season (who knows—maybe even more) to embrace coin jewelry in all its shiny glory.1.

The Best Mask Straps & Accessories To Make Wearing One Way More Fun,"Ah, fall fashion. I couldn’t love it more if I tried! Fall is definitely my favorite season when it comes to styling, as I can combine my favorite aspects of winter (like chic jackets and fun layering) and summer (like showing some skin and playing with color) to create an especially dreamy wardrobe. This season, I really want to go all out, so I’m shopping the top fall fashion trends early to get ahead of the game.What’s in, you ask? The classics. Oversized blazers and slacks will be making a highly anticipated return but this year, they’re joined by cozy striped sweaters and ballet flats (cue gasp). Yes, ballet flats! The shoe we all thought was doomed to being an early 2000’s fashion faux pas has made a triumphant comeback. Hopefully, you’re ready to give them a second turn.Denim is also eager for a reinvention beyond baggy jeans and jackets and is coming in at full force in dress form. I dare you to layer a denim tank dress over a striped sweater (it’ll be amazing).As for accessories, maximalist jewelry is still all the rage. Statement pendants are the coolest way to express yourself this season.

Just ask Hailey Bieber, who’s always seen in a new pair of parachute pants when she’s off duty or supporting Justin at a show. This trend is a callback to the ’90s and we’re here for it. Especially when it’s paired with a tighter top to balance out the weight of the ensemble. Even better: basically any shoe looks good with these bottoms. Ballet flats, chunky sneakers, boots, trainers you name it.Courtesy of Urban Outfitters.Balloon Cargo PantsGet the look of cargo pants with the comfort of cotton bottoms when you wear these balloon trousers. This pair from Urban Outfitters comes in so many unique colorways that will help you add a pop of color to whatever outfit you’ve got planned. In our opinion, the bolder and brighter you go, the better.   iets frans… Balloon Cargo Pant$75     Buy Now Courtesy of Everlane.The Way-High Drape PantYes, it’s possible to bring the baggy pants trend to the office. Case in point: these checkered bottoms from Everlane. They still give your legs the freedom to move around unrestricted but have a bit more structure to them so that HR would approve.   The Way-High Drape Pant$128     Buy Now Sailor StripesStripes are a pattern that comes in so many widths, colors, and formats that it never goes out of style—unlike cheetah print which runs in just as fast as it runs out. However, there are moments where stripes break out of their preppy affiliation and find their way into every aesthetic. This is one of those moments. Sailor-style stripes in the classic navy and white pairing are about to be hanging over every fashionable set of shoulders this fall. The pattern looks great in a loose-knit weave sweater, long sleeve t-shirt or even on a blazer. Pro tip: always check the men’s selection of sweaters if you love an oversized look.Courtesy of Mango.Striped Knit SweaterIs it a little too early to be wearing a full-on sweater? Yes. Will you be dreaming of this sweater the second temperatures hit 50 degrees? Also, yes. Make the move and get this cuffed sweater in anticipation of cooler days ahead.

Knitted Half Zip Sweater$135     Buy Now Ballet FlatsBallet flats have been trying to make a comeback for a few seasons but I’m here to report that it’s finally show time. Now before you decide this trend isn’t for you, I beg you to take a deep breath and let go of the grudge you have against ballet flats. I promise that nobody is asking you to wear them with skinny jeans or a skater skirt. Instead, picture yourself wearing them with linen slacks, chic midi skirts, vintage denim and even a low-rise mini skirt. Cool right? I’m so excited to embrace this trend and become the shining star of Balletcore.Courtesy of Zara.Bow Trim Leather Ballet FlatsLeave it to Zara to have the coolest (and most affordable) version of the trend.

Hoop Earrings So Truly Massive You Could Probably Fit Your Head Through Them,"Anyone who knows me well will not be surprised to hear that tropical jewelry sits at the intersection of everything I love about fashion. The tropical print revival has long been one of my favorite trends, as its roots in “ugly” fashion run deep. Call me ascetic, but few things sound more fun than digging up some fascinating, by-all-contemporary-definitions ugly piece of clothing and rendering it trendy, chic, covetable. Nothing—not even a shirt embraced only by frat bros and dads on vacation—can trump creative styling. Tropical prints are fun, and unexpected, and challenging. And statement jewelry is delightfully campy no matter what form it’s taking. 2019’s tropical jewelry trend, then, is a marriage of two lovely, lovely things.Summer 2019 has, by all measures, really only just begun—but it’s already seen an array of statement jewelry trends enter the zeitgeist. Fruit jewelry has shown us our taste buds and our taste in clothing have more in common than we’d think. Last year’s shell jewelry trend is back and perhaps even more eye-catching than ever. And the somewhat recent friendship bracelet trend has reminded us all of the importance of wearing our hearts on our sleeves (or really, on our wrists). Tropical jewelry is joining a vast and varied cast of statement-making players—all of which are sitting idly by on digital shelves, just waiting to add a healthy dose of personality (and a trendy dose of camp) to your accessories arsenal.Though some of this season’s other jewelry trends are limited in terms of form (friendshipbracelets, for instance), tropical jewelry spans genres. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a necklace person, or an earrings person, or awhatever person—you’re sure to find a trendy piece that’ll work for you (though it bears mentioning that tropical earrings are particularly abundant). So what are you waiting for? I’m serving you a veritable plethora of ways to keep your love of the tropics close to heart and mind at all times—all you have to do is scroll down.1.

5 Jewelry Trends For This Season You Won't Want to Miss,"And the award goes to…the STATEMENT NECKLACE! If you didn’t have time to watch the Oscars red carpet, I hate to break it to you, but you missed a lot of great looks. To bring you up to speed, allow me to present the number one Oscars 2020 jewelry trend: Necklaces.The abundance of statement necklaces on the carpet positively blew me away, and it seemed like everyone from Janelle Monae to Florence Pugh had a neck drenched in diamonds. Even though these celebs wowed in dresses that were eye-catching all on their own, many chose to couple them with chunky necklaces that were just as impressive, and it’s an accessory trick I’ll most definitely be copying for my next night-out look.Check out the biggest and blingiest necklaces of the night below, as well as a few glitzy options for trying out the look yourself.Photo: ShutterstockJanelle MonaeJanelle Monae’s spectacular hooded gown is the kind of dress that needs no accessorizing, and yet she took things one step further with a blinged-out choker to match her sparkling ensemble.Photo: ShutterstockMindy KalingMindy Kaling’s necklace isn’t just gorgeous— it’s ex$pensive. During her red carpet interview, Kaling told Ryan Seacrest that she had to have a bodyguard accompany her all night just to make sure it was safe! The Zaxie To the Moon and Back CZ Tennis Necklace gives off the same dripping-in-diamonds vibes, but at just under $100, it’s likely quite a bit more affordable than Kaling’s priceless piece.Photo: ZaxieZaxie CZ Tennis Necklace$95Buy NowPhoto: ShutterstockZazie BeetzZazie Beets wins my vote for Best Statement Necklace of the night. This thing is major, people! The diamond and emerald masterpiece truly belongs in a museum.Photo: David Fisher/ShutterstockGreta GerwigGreta Gerwig joined Zazie in rocking an emerald-and-diamond look, and the gorgeous green gems really made her eyes pop. If you’re vining with these emerald looks, consider rocking the Charter Club Crystal Collar Necklace for just under $40.Photo: Macy’sCharter Club Crystal Collar Necklace$39.50Buy NowPhoto: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP/ShutterstockKristin CavallariKristin Cavallari’s matching necklace and earring combo has inspired me to start buying all my jewelry in sets. So good!Photo: ShutterstockLily SinghLily Singh scrapped the diamond approach worn by so many other celebs and instead layered two pearl necklaces with a chunky golden chain. To copy Singh’s look, try the BaubleBar Duo Pearl Choker Necklace, which can be doubled up on the neck for a similar layered look.Photo: BaubleBarBaubleBar Duo Pearl Choker Necklace$44Buy NowPhoto: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP/ShutterstockFlorence PughThank heavens my queen, Florence Pugh, has signed off on the statement necklace trend. Now I can really love it. Hers featured a massive teardrop-shaped ruby to contrast the turquoise color of her gown.Photo: Broadimage/ShutterstockJulia Louis-DreyfusSpaghetti straps are typically thought of as a casual silhouette, so Julia Louis-Dreyfus dressed hers up with diamonds, natch. The Cristabelle Crystal Baguette Thick Collar Necklace does a good job of mimicking Louis-Dreyfus’s necklace’s perfect balance of blingy, but not too over-the-top sparkle.

"Trust Us, You Don't Want To Sleep On This Jewelry Trend","Surely it would surprise no one to hear me call name tags a necessary evil. No onewants to adorn themselves with a glorified human label—an adhesive one that ruins their outfit, no less.But. One of 2019’s most visible sartorial movements—the name jewelry trend—has called this logic into question. Maybe we don’t mind wearing glorified human labels. Maybe we enjoy adorning ourselves with our names. Maybe welike accessories that do the talking—or at least, the introducing—for us.In its first iteration, the name jewelry trend was perhaps most iconically sported by two abject style goddesses: Carrie Bradshaw (of fictionalSex and the City fame) and Princess Diana. Diana was spotted, on many occasions, sporting a short necklace emblazoned with the letter D. And asSATC fans know well, Carrie wore a “Carrie” necklace throughout the show’s tenure. (The necklace even became a central plot point in one episode.) This trend, as all trends are wont to do, trickled out of the zeitgeist. And then it trickled back in. Name jewelry is now available in basically every jewelry format—earrings, chokers, bracelets, hair accessories—and basically every name format, too (which is really just to say, you can go to Diana initial route, or the Carrie full-name route).And those who find themselves a bit put off by the whole wearing their name 24/7 thing can rest assured knowing a sub-iteration of the trend has re-emerged, alongside the name jewelry one.Word jewelry—accessories inscribed with various words (notnecessarily names)—is as abundantly on offer as name jewelry is. You can sport your favorite curse word. Or announce how #blessed you are to the world. You can don jewelry that renders you a self-proclaimed queen. Hell, you can even wear Marc Jacob’s name in hoop earring form, if that were ever a thing you’d dreamt of.So crack open a dictionary and remind yourself of all your favorite words. Odds are, they’re currently available in accessory form, just waiting to be sported by the likes of you.[sc-button price=”85″ url=”https://www.shopbop.com/logo-hoop-marc-jacobs/vp/v=1/1513051330.htm” title=”Marc Jacobs The Logo Hoops”]We weren’t kidding when we said the Marc Jacobs thing.

Enter: mask straps, chains and other accessories that turn your (necessary) face mask into a full-blown lewk.If you’re skeptical about adding accessories—and, in particular, achain—to your mask, I hear you. But these beauts aren’t your grandma’s glasses chain. Both chunkyand dainty chains and straps have had a major comeback (They look really cute on sunglasses, FYI!), and the trend has transitioned seamlessly to work with all your favorite face masks. Typically, you just clip the accessories onto your mask and go!

You could opt for a pearl-adorned mask chain to give your mask a bit of a 1920s or preppy vibe, for one. Or, pair your simple black face mask with a colorful mask to spice things up. You can also go with a classic gold link mask chain, too—especially if you’re really into 2020’s jewelry trends. And if chains aren’t your thing, there are headbands and hair clips to help you keep your mask looking cute AF as well!

5 Summer Jewelry Trends That Work From The Beach To Happy Hour,"Each year brings with it several trendy retro revivals—most cyclical, most expected. Trends come and go, and then come back again; such is the way the sartorial world works, and we’re typically excited to see old favorites making a comeback. But every so often, a vintage trend creeps into the zeitgeist and sees a resurgence none of us could have possibly predicted. Such was the case with dad sneakers, tropical prints and the enduring bike short. And now, sunglasses chains (known by many as sunglasses lanyards) are seeing a similar treatment.Earlier this month, a Free People representative told StyleCaster that sunglasses lanyards—chains that attach to the sides of your sunglasses and drape behind your head, like a backwards necklace—were poised to be big come summer 2019. And the summer accessories that retailers have on offer have only backed up this assertion. Nasty Gal, Urban Outfitters and Free People are littered with chains meant to adorn your sunglasses (or even your regular glasses), because in the age of maximalism, everything deserves a little accessorizing.We get it—this is oneseriously strange trend. Eyeglass chains feel classically vintage, whereas lanyards reek of frat bro origins. This is one odd couple that never deserved a meet-cute. Yet they got one, and when the result of this union is as sophisticated-yet-unabashedly-fun as sunglasses chains are, it’s kind of hard to be mad, no?1.

"Five 2021 Jewelry Trends To Invest In, From Pendants To Pearls","Jewelry trends are among the strangest around. In 2018, we thought it advisable to hang faces from our ears. So far in 2019, we’ve grown attached to adorning ourselves with glorified nametags, sporting fruit-shaped baubles of all kinds and extending our tropical print obsession into the accessory sphere. We’ve also taken our mild obsession with hoop earrings to a new level; the hoop earrings trend has become the big hoop earrings trend, which has since become thetruly massive hoop earrings trend. A huge hoop is simply not an adequately huge hoop unless it’s huge enough to stick your entire head through.Our initial resurrection of the hoop earrings trend was a nod to the early aughts, when hoop earrings were as abundant as low-rise jeans, butterfly clips and chainmail. Metallic textiles and shiny embellishments abounded, accentuated by the circular metal hoops we hung from our ears. Though we’ve revived a great many 2000s-inspired sartorial movements, hoops have pervaded the zeitgeist unlike any other (perhaps because they’re a bit more approachable than, say, that iconic sparkly cowl mini that hardly covered Paris Hilton’s body at all). But, as we and our camp-loving hearts are wont to do, we’ve taken hoop earrings to their most voluminous extreme. We’ve demanded that they not only be circles, but that they be enormous circles—gargantuan circles. If a hoop earring isn’t big enough to graze our shoulders—or more dramatically, our collarbones—is it even a hoop earring at all?!We’d be remiss not to admit that wearing truly massive hoop earrings is a power move in its own right. And surely, being able to shove your head through your earring is a pretty impressive party trick. But all we really want to know is: Where will it end? Will we not be satisfied until hoops have become so colossal that we can fit our entire selves through them? That we can hula hoop with them? That we can loop them ’round our houses—nay, our yards? Will hoop earrings continue growing and growing until they envelop our earth?Only time will tell. For now, there is shopping to be done—and there are huge hoop earrings to be had.

13 Ways To Start Wearing Spring's Enamel Jewelry Trend Right Now,"Growing up, pearl jewelry epitomized one thing and one thing only: classic glamour. Pearl pieces were to be paired exclusively with ball gowns and fancy gloves, making them a favorite of mine any time I went to play dress-up. As time went on, though, pearl jewelry was remixed, and then remixed again. It no longer felt exclusively reserved for the upper echelons of society; new iterations left the jewelry trend accessible to any aesthetic. And these days, pearl pieces are almost as commonplace as rhinestones were during the early aughts.Now that we’ve lifted the veil of exclusivity that once barred pearl jewelry from the masses, out-of-the-box pearl pieces have made their way into fast-fashion retailers. Pearl-covered barrettes are on the sartorial menu. So are pearl-lined chokers and pearl-dotted bobby pins. Pearl-covered hoops have offered jewelry designers a way to capitalize on two earring trends at once; the hoop-drop hybrid feels endlessly edgy, no matter how many times it’s done.The best thing about pearl jewelry isn’t its classic appeal or its aesthetic versatility—but the fact that it’s never a bad buy. No one will ever reminisce on the pearl jewelry they’ve purchased with buyer’s remorse or trend-follower’s regret. Pearl pieces are nevernot chic, no matter how out-of-the-box they are. Pearl jewelry is a no-fail purchase, and given the immense variety of unique pearl jewelry on the market right now, there’s never been a better time to stock up.1.

Mejuri's New Enamel Rings Nail 2021's Hottest Jewelry Trend,"You’ve slipped on your favorite dress, slid on a pair of kitten heels, and slicked your hair back into the perfect bun. You’re almost ready to walk out the door but your look is missing one major thing: details. Whether you identify with the “less is more” or “more is more” school of thought regarding fashion, both parties can agree that the best outfits include some kind of accessory. Summer’s jewelry trends have been solidified (and spoiler alert: they’ll easily last through the fall) and they’re just what you need to add that extra dazzling detail to your outfit.One of my favorite things about jewelry trends is that they aren’t as volatile as fashion trends. High-quality jewelry usually has sentimental value and also often comes with a higher price tag. This means that jewelry trends stick around for a more extended period of time because people aren’t looking to part ways with their favorite pieces.I take the personal approach of investing in my everyday staples like a simple gold chain, studs, or name initial ring and then letting myself have fun with less expensive costume jewelry. I also think finding inspiration from your friends and family is helpful. For example, my mom has a gold coin jewelry set that she’s worn throughout the last 20 years. The set makes a statement and has never gone out of style—I always admire the look of it when she wears it so I’d be willing to invest in a similar piece!The top jewelry trends this summer fall into the investment and trend categories. For example, the chain link necklaces, sleek silver hoops, and floral jewelry all have incredible longevity. If they tire out at any point, you know they’ll always eventually come back. On the trendier end, we have charm bracelets and initial necklaces. Both of these trends are meant to be customized which makes them great gift options—fashion is always more fun when you can share it with a friend.iMaxTree.1. FloralsFlorals are often associated with summer dresses or the tablescape at a dinner party, but the trend is in full bloom in the accessories sphere. Floral earrings are especially having a moment and are a fun twist on the whimsical look of tucking a flower behind your ear. The style works with statement earrings, flower-encrusted hoops or bracelet charms.iMaxTree.2. Sleek Silver HoopsOk if you haven’t caught on by now, all the hot girls and guys are wearing silver hoops. Big or small, stacked or single, silver hoops are still the coolest thing you can put in your ears (sorry Airpods). Feel free to mix metals and add a combination of silver and gold to your ear stack.iMaxTree.3. Chain Link NecklacesYou’re going to want to link up with this jewelry trend—literally. Chain link necklaces are the perfect everyday accessory and can be customized to your lifestyle. For example, I wear two delicate link chain necklaces every day that add subtle detail to my outfitsandI don’t have to take them on and off to sleep, shower, etc. You can choose how heavy you want the metal to be, how many you want to layer and if you want to add charms to your stack.iMaxTree.4. Initial JewelryJewelry is so personal and the initial and name jewelry trend proves it! Wearing a customizable name necklace, initial ring or both is a fun way to make a “this is me!” statement. Initial jewelry can also be a meaningful way to show your connection to someone else—whether it’s your significant other, parent or child’s initials, adding a piece to your collection will keep them close to you all day.Getty Images.5. Charm BraceletsCharm bracelets are back and better than ever. Tap into early 2000’s nostalgia with a decked-out charm bracelet on your wrist. Charms are a fun way to show off your niche interests, give your friend a meaningful gift, celebrate a memory or create a #twinning moment. "
"2020's Top Jewelry Trends Are All About Drama, So Layer Up"," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.It’s easy to get caught up in revamping your wardrobe to fit the season’s latest trends. But between the cut-outs, faux fur coats, low-rise jeans, and dip-dye, the fashion trends may begin to seem overwhelming when the outfit options become endless. When you’re standing in the dressing room of Zara trying to determine which item to purchase, let me remind you that jewelry is often what makes and completes an outfit. So keep your fashion simple, grab your favorite black sweater or white button-down and shift your energy to focus on the jewelry trends for 2023. From simple silver hoops to bold bangles, there’s a jewelry trend to add a little extra flair to any look.While clothing always tells a story, jewelry is considered to be more personal. You may already have a signature piece that you wear every day or something with deep sentimental value. Oftentimes, these personally valuable pieces lean on the side of individual taste more than a trend, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do both. The best part of jewelry? Layers, stacks and statements pieces. The hardest part is picking which pieces to pair together!I interviewed jewelry designer and curator, Stephanie Gottlieb, for an expert opinion on how to play into 2023’s biggest jewelry moments and the key to finding a balance between trendy and timeless.First and foremost, if you’re looking to invest in your personal jewelry collection, it’s best to prioritize purchasing pieces that will maintain quality and value.“I always recommend for a new buyer to start with the classics like diamond studs, a tennis bracelet, or a diamond stack bands and then if you’re wanting to introduce the trendy pieces do that after you’ve already built the wardrobe of the staples,” Gottlieb advises. But when it comes to trendy pieces, Gottlieb says the opposite, “Buy costume to start and upgrade over time as the budget allows. You can sprinkle in less expensive fashion-forward trendy pieces.”Tom Ford; iMaxTree.Her advice seems simple enough—invest in quality, play with quantity! Luckily, 2023’s jewelry trends give you the opportunity to do a bit of both. Classic silver and gold pieces aren’t going anywhere—if anything, they’re getting more popular. If you’ve already built a collection of Hailey Bieber-inspired gold hoops (I sure know I have), consider mixing in some silver metal and vice versa. Don’t be afraid to upgrade your classic metals but simply goingbigger.According to Gottlieb, “We’re going to see a big comeback of the ‘80s and still some of the ‘90s. Think lots of chunky gold jewelry, big hoops and geometric shapes.” Based on the Spring/Summer ‘23 runway shows, Gottlieb is spot on.Keep reading for the five biggest jewelry trends expected to shine throughout 2023 (hey, it’s never too early to start wearing them!).Tory Burch; Jonathan Simkhai, iMaxTree.Totally CuffedA silver or gold cuff is the perfect example of a way to make a subtle statement with just one piece. Cuff bracelets are proving themselves to be the easiest way to elevate any look. The silhouette is often just a thick, arched curve but the impact is big! For starters, cuffs are usually adjustable which means you can wear them in multiple ways. If you prefer a classic look, add a cuff (or two) around your wrist to shine under the sleeve of your shirt or sweater. To make the trend more interesting, slip the cuff up your forearm like the models wore at Missoni, or opt for a wrap-around cuff as seen on the models at Tory Burch.Courtesy of Banana Republic.Hammered Cuff BraceletThis silver cuff has a wave structure to it which will help reflect light and make it super eye-catching. Plus, it’s only $30 so it’s a great way to try out to trend without feeling handcuffed to it.   Hammered Cuff Bracelet $30 (was $50)     Buy Now Courtesy of Karine Sultan.Four Row CuffI love this tiered cuff for special occasions. Pair it with a strapless or slip dress to add dimension to your look.   Four Row Cuff$98     Buy Now Jil Sander; Missoni, iMaxTree.Superior SilverGold has been associated with first place for long enough, it’s silver’s time to shine. Oversized silver statement hoops were a staple on the spring/summer ’23 runway and the second I saw Bella Hadid wear them during the Jil Sander show, I was sold. I’m putting my bets in now that she repeats the silver hoops for a street-style moment. Oversized silver hoops are another ’80s trend but they look incredibly modern when paired with 2023’s runway trends. For everyday wear, consider downsizing the hoop size (your ears will thank you) and leave the big guys for special occasions.Courtesy of Stephanie Gottlieb.35mm Tube Hoop EarringsIf you plan on wearing a pair of earrings on a daily basis, it’s definitely worth investing in a pair that won’t irritate your ears or tarnish. This pair of tube hoops by Stephanie Gottlieb are actually made with 14k white gold and are well worth the higher price point.   35mm Tube Hoop Earrings $520     Buy Now Courtesy of Zara.Rectangular EarringsSometimes it’s just easier to go with a faux-hoop (aka stud). This pair from Zara has a unique rectangular shape that will pair great with your go=to blazer.   Rectangular Earrings $17.90     Buy Now Blumarine; Coach, iMaxTree.Strands of BeadsThinly beaded necklaces are the perfect trend for layering experts. Whether you’re stacking multiple strands of the same beads, mixing and matching, or just letting a singular strand speak for itself, this boho trend is a casual way to accessorize. Take notes from Blumarine, the totally Y2 K-inspired brand, and add a charm to a beaded strand, or get inspired by Coach’s quirky decision to add unusual objects to a long strand like a sports whistle. You don’t need to wear a flower crown or long skirt for beads to work with your outfit.Courtesy of Nordstrom.Carabiner Beaded NecklaceSpeaking of unconventional objects, this beaded necklace comes with an adorable carabiner charm and makes the perfect gift for an outdoorsy friend.   Carabiner Beaded Necklace $24.50 (was $49)     Buy Now Courtesy of Mejuri.Coastal Blue Lace Agate NecklaceMejuri is known for their everyday gold jewelry but turns out they have a great selection of beaded options as well. I love this blue agate necklace for a beachy vibe.   Coastal Blue Lace Agate Necklace$198     Buy Now Tory Burch; Ulla Johnson, iMaxTree.Back to BohoRemember when everyone had hair feathers? Me too. Well, we’re bringing the essence of the trend back in a significantly less-cringy way with dangly boho earrings. Whether the earrings have feathers, fringe or simple just hang past your collarbone, this earring trend is a fun alternative to the sparkly night-luxe earrings we were seeing last season (and work significantly better for daytime activities).Courtesy of Anthropologie.Circle Drop EarringsTe studs on this pair of circle drop earrings totally look like a full moon! Wear them to manifest good vibes for 2023.   Circle Drop Earrings $54     Buy Now Courtesy of Free People.Jaxon Stone HoopIt’s no surprise that Free People is the go-to for boho accessories. I love this pair of charm hoops with long tassel ends.   Jaxon Stone Hoop$28     Buy Now Patbo; Laquan Smith, iMaxTree.Bangin’ BanglesBangles are back and I’m not mad about it! Bangles are like a cuff bracelet’s fun younger sister–they may not be as sophisticated but they certainly know how to party! The ’80s-inspired accessory is a great way to play up a look for a night out and show off your personality. If you don’t already have bangles stored away from an old Halloween costume, take this trend as an opportunity to build your collection—and I literally mean build it! Building a stack of bangles is the most creative way to participate—geometric shapes, clear acrylics, and animal print patterns are all fair game.Courtesy of Asos.2-Pack Bangles in Clear and BlueThis is a trend you certainly don’t need to break the bank for. This set of 2 bangles is under $15 and would look amazing with a sparkly mini dress or skirt for girl’s night.   2-Pack Bangles in Clear and Blue $14.50     Buy Now Courtesy of Alexis Bittar.Molten 14K Goldplated Hinged Lucite BraceletIf you can’t help but splurge on a boujie bangle, I recommend this gold-plated lucite bracelet by Alexis Bittar.

Chunky Chain Bracelets to Instantly Elevate Your Look," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.I’m very lucky because my mom is a total fashion icon. When we go shopping together, we almost always leave with matching fashion finds. For this reason, the mother-daughter matching jewelry trend is perfect.I’ve been stealing her clothes, bags and jewelry for as long as I can remember and incorporating them into my own wardrobe. I even got caught trying to bring some of her items to college with me (my mission was unsuccessful). I love the idea of coordinating jewelry because it’s a way to bring everyday sentimental value to both of our looks. It also saves us from being too matchy-matchy and doubles our options (because we obviously still swap pieces).Coordinating jewelry, especially in a mother-daughter sense, doesn’t need to feel like a gimmick. Don’t get me wrong, I was a huge fan of matching friendship bracelets and half-heart necklaces as a kid but I want my grown-up jewelry to feel a little more elevated.Now I look for easy ways to build continuity between our collections. One way this can be done is by focusing on a motif, like the stars or the moon, and finding pieces within that theme. I also love the idea of choosing a stone or jewel and finding jewelry that features the same element.AP Images.Zoë Kravitz and her mom Lisa Bonet do an incredible job of coordinating jewelry in a way that still speaks to their individual personal styles. Kravitz’s gold earrings and body chain compliment Bonet’s bird brooch on her collar and gold hoops.A lot of jewelry brands also have signature styles that they incorporate throughout most of their pieces. By shopping for jewelry from the same brand, there’s a good chance that the design elements will be consistent throughout—you can take a brand’s signature style and make it one you and your mom are known for wearing.AP Images.If being subtle isn’t your thing, take a page out of Kris and Khloe Kardashian’s book and go bold. The Kardashian duo not only wore bright diamond earrings, but coordinated their twisted glitter dresses. This is a fun way to make sure everyone is aware of family ties at functions.Whether you’re pairing earrings and bracelets or rings and necklaces, mother-daughter jewelry is so sweet and sentimental. Mother’s Day is also quickly approaching so this is a great way to get your mom and yourself (for the sake of the trend of course) something special.Keep reading for my favorite coordinating picks.A Pearl PairPerhaps the most classic way to coordinate with your mom is by wearing complementary sets of pearls. Pearl jewelry is a staple of sophisticated style but can also allude to the more carefree fashion of the 1920s. Pearls are currently having a modern resurgence and are being incorporated into heavy chain necklaces, huggie earrings or other gem clusters. This means that even if you are a die-hard Y2K grunge-girl and your mom prefers a classic strand, you can still coordinate jewelry and have a meaningful connection.To The Moon & BackIf you’re into astrology or just love spending a long night under the stars, moon and star-themed jewelry is a great way to connect with your mom and the great unknown. Stars are super on-trend for jewelry right now so it’s easy to find celestial gems to wear. One of you can sport a crescent moon necklace while the other wears sparkly star earring studs (or vice versa) to stick with the theme. If you want to get multiple siblings in on the look, a moon and star charm bracelet is also a fun option for everyone to wear.Diamonds Are Your Mom’s Best FriendYou don’t have to have an heirloom engagement ring to connect to your family with diamonds. Diamonds come in all shapes and sizes which makes them easy to personalize and fun to mix and match. A matching pair of small diamond studs are great for everyday wear and will be a subtle daily reminder of your mom. Having different pieces in the same shape or setting is another way to have a subtle #twinning moment. Diamonds are also available in moissanite and lab-grown alternatives so you don’t have to break the bank to participate. "

I tend to pick a few more expensive pieces of jewelry and wear them for months without taking them off. Because of my long-time commitment to jewelry I end up gravitating towards timeless pieces but recently, the spring jewelry trends for 2022 have caught my eye.Suddenly, I’m interested in switching out my classic gold jewelry for understated silver.

Spring fashion trends keep getting brighter and brighter so it’s no surprise that jewelry is headed in the same direction.From blingy choker neckalces (yep, they’re back again) inspired by Olivia Rodrigo’s Grammys look to Old Hollywood drop earrings, there are plenty of pieces to up your accessory game.

Anklets Are Summer 2019's Coolest Jewelry Trend,"I’m the type of gal who sticks to a few gold earrings or a simple gold chain and calls it a day, so I never thought I would be one to gravitate toward colorful jewelry. But if 2021 has taught me anything so far, it’s that I should probably branch out and try new things, and my newfound color obsession is making it that easy. Case in point: I have (somehow) fallen head over heels for the enamel jewelry trendthat has been taking over my social media feeds. Luckily for me, these rainbow-brite pieces don’t seem to be going away anytime soon.It all started when I spotted a pair of Mejuri’s enamel hoops while aimlessly browsing the web the other night and instantly fell in love. I thought it was simply because I was tired, so I shut my laptop and tried to forget about them—but I couldn’t. Turns out, that was just the beginning of my enamel jewelry spiral. Now, I’ve found tons of different options at literally every price point imaginable, and they’re all sitting in my cart waiting for me to pull the proverbial trigger and place a slew of orders.So, I’ve rounded up 13 of my favorite pieces of enamel jewelry to share with you, in hopes that I won’t be the only one impulse-shopping. And when I say these price points are good, I mean it! There’s a gorgeous enamel yin yang ring that you can buy on Amazon for under $12 bucks—although big spenders may want the original almost-$700 Bea Bongiasca ring that put the enamel look on the map.As Cyndi Lauper once said: I see your true colors and they’re shining through on any of these pieces of colorful enamel jewelry.

"So Everyone Is Obsessed With Pearls Now, Right?","Our opportunities to experiment with style took a massive hit over the last year, but the accessories we chose to wear while working from home were our saving grace. I seriously miss the days prior to then where I could put on “real” pants and deck myself out in every blingy earring, bracelet and necklace in my jewelry box. Now that we’re starting to go out and about again, hopefully, Mejuri’s brand-new enamel rings can help me get a handle on some of 2021’s biggest jewelry trends.I once thought colorful jewelry was a thing of the past. Sure, I used to stack on bright bangles and plastic rings when I played dress-up as a kid, but I’ve opted for wearing more understated pieces made from gold or silver since becoming a real adult. That said, it looks like Mejuri is officially making colors cool again with their new selection of enamel pieces, and I’m surprisingly here for it. The collection includes two ring styles and a pair of hoop earrings that come in shades of green, brown and blue. If you’re a true magpie at heart, don’t fret—these enamel pieces are adorned with a single shiny stone in the center for an added blingy bonus.All trends really do end up coming back around. Similar to the pearl jewelry craze that took over my Instagram feed last month and revived the look I once considered stuffy and outdated, enamel is being completely reinvented in 2021. In Mejuri’s collection, the colors are more understated rather than bold or intense, so they’ll play well with your favorite metallic pieces and chunky gold chains. Just like everything else Mejuri sells, these rings are just bold enough to make a statement.Add a few of these rings into your collection for a playful pop of color this season. Read on to see all of the pretty shades.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

"The Cutest Ways To Say 'I'm Vaxxed, Not Anti-Mask' This Summer","Sure, diamond rings and classic pendant necklace—from lockets to shell-adorned chokers, and everything in between— is definitely jewelry staples that every accessory lover should own at least one of in their personal collection, but if you’re looking to add a bit of either edge of elegance to your look, embellishing your wrist with statement arm candy is your best bet for looking subtle yet adding a little something extra to help refine your overall look. Chunky, chain bracelets are a classic option that transcends the fickle cycle of jewelry trends, and they always somehow manage to look both chic and bold without coming across as over-the-top, super-trendy, or downright gaudy.Whether you prefer a braided silver-toned style or a slimmer gold-toned bracelet, these wrist upgrades have the power to add that ambiguous yet all too common, “something’s missing” touch to your outfit with just one signature piece.

"2018 Might Be Long Gone, but Coin Jewelry Isn't","It’s hardly a stretch to make the argument that last year’s biggest overarching jewelry trend was the Instagram-famous coin necklace, endorsed by countless influencers, style editors and street style stars alike. It makes sense that this classic jewelry style went remarkably viral, as coin necklaces offer the utmost versatility, thanks to their infinitely stackable appeal (the coin and nameplate duo have remained a popular layering combo)—punctuated, of course, by their inherently vintage charm. This spring, though, there’s a new influencer-approved jewelry trend on the block: seashell jewelry.Not only are gilded seashell-shaped designs cropping up as adornments on necklaces, but the resort-ready motif is also a dominant embellishment for rings, statement earrings and hair accessories this season. Even ’90s-era puka shells are coming back to life in modernized jewelry styles that—don’t worry—aren’t exact replicas of the throwback styles beloved by teenage surfers of decades’ past.Before you begin to cringe at this beachy trend’s somewhat startling resurrection, know that today’s puka-imbued jewelry has been revised with polished updates that prevent the designs from looking like an artifact of ’90s ska culture—or some overpriced souvenir purchased at the hotel gift shop during your childhood family vacation. And, if you still need further proof that the unlikely style’s return to fashion is, in fact, a thing, look to none other than Gigi Hadid, who was spotted sporting a puka choker during Paris Fashion Week.Of course, if you can’t even entertain the idea of bringing back the vacation-inspired chokers of your youth, there are plenty of other shell-designed iterations of this under-the-sea trend that feel a bit more refined. Traditional conch shell designs, spiraling shark eyes, and sophisticated sand dollars with opalescent finishes feel more sophisticated (and office-appropriate) than kitsch or novel.And let’s be clear about one thing: last year’s coin necklaces are a timeless, ultra-wearable jewelry piece, so we’re certainly not writing them off as a thing of the past. But if you’ve grown tired of the endlessly ubiquitous coin trend, opt for one of these fresh, under-the-sea (and summer-ready) alternatives, instead.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

5 Upcoming Fall Fashion Trends That Are Actually Groundbreaking,"I’ve never had a particularly kitschy fashion sense, but lately, accessorizing with a bit of whimsy just brings me joy—hence why I’m leaning into 2020’s fruit jewelry trend so damn hard. Somewhere between the cottagecore/picnic aesthetic and the classic Girl Next Door exists a perfect blend of the two: The Girl Next Door Who Owns Too Many Plants, Has A Window Sill Garden & Wears Fruit Jewelry. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m happy to announce that I am she. She is me. We are one.But to be clear, I’m not the only one in love with the look. After luxury brands like Mercedes Salazar debuted fun, fruity accessories for summer (I’ve been dreaming about their Tropics Strawberry Earrings for months) and Insta-famous brands like Et Toi Paris littered my Explore Page with cutesy fruitsy jewelry, it seemed the trend was everywhere—and don’t even get me started about the amount of fruit jewelry on Etsy. It’s not to be believed, y’all. Whether or not you think a salad complements your meal, a fruit-themed accessory can and will complement your outfit, so don’t hesitate to try the trend out.Bella Gerard.My personal recommendation for cute statement fruit jewelry that doesn’t look cheesy? I’ve been lovingUK-based brand I’MMANY London‘s Summer Capsule ’20, full of strawberries, grapes and the like. I’MMANY’s collection is about as chic as produce-themed jewelry can get, and the star of the show are undoubtedly their wide array of cherry earrings. You can shop single-drop stems or two-cherry earrings, and choose from a classic red hue to more playful colorways like iridescent lilac, pink and light gray.Bella Gerard.   Double Cherry Drop Earrings$124.60     Buy Now Besides the gold-plated brass brass stems, the coloring on theDouble Cherry Drop Earringslooks so realistic—like, it almost looks as if I went to the grocery store and Michael’s and DIY’d these babies myself. While cherries can sometimes look a little too retro or kitschy, these are actually super classy, and I especially love the idea of pairing them with an all-white outfit, a reddish lip stain and some faux freckles for good measure.Bella Gerard.   Red StrawberryHuggie Hoop Earring$56.64     Buy Now A slightly smaller statement that’s just as sweet is theRed StrawberryHuggie Hoop Earring, sold singular so that you can mix and match with I’MMANY’s other huggie hoops, should you choose to. Fruit jewelry is already as bold as I’ll go, so I played it safe with two red strawberries, but there are also sweet little leaves and berries of all sorts of colors to choose from. My favorite part? That itty-bitty pearl detail at the top, of course.Bella Gerard.If you’re ready to spice up your neutral summer wardrobe with a few statement accessories, the fruit jewelry trend is the move, and I can’t recommend I’MMANY London’s selection enough. Did I mention they also have a Garden Society Collection full of even more produce? Suddenly, I’m in need of a red pepper necklace and a lettuce leaf charm bracelet.

10 Summer Camp Jewelry Pieces That Make You Look Craftier Than You Are,"There are few celebs I admire more than Hailey Bieber when it comes to off-duty style. I honestly can’t think of a time when I didn’t want to copy something she’s worn—and if her Instagram feed is any indication, it looks like Bieber is ready to serve up inspo for my entire summer wardrobe, especiallymy beach outfits! The model just posted a pic in the most delicate gold body chain and I’m obsessed with her take on styling body jewelry for 2021.ICYMI: It’s May, people! Summer is here and no one is more ready for warm weather than Hailey Bieber. I mean, she’s already showing off her bikini collection on the ‘gram and I’m taking detailed notes! Her most recent post featured a baby pink string bikini from TRIANGL paired with the real star of the show, a glimmering body chain by Jacquie Aiche styled with two coordinating diamond necklaces. She topped off her look with a pair of chunky gold hoop earrings and a few Y2K-inspired mini ponytails around the crown of her head. Yup, copying this look ASAP!         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Hailey Rhode Baldwin Bieber (@haileybieber)If the words “body chain” traumatize you, fear not. These are not the chunky waist chains of the early aughts! Bieber’s version is of a far more delicate nature, which feels much more modern and chic. It also makes the accessory more wearable in my eyes. You can style it like she did over a bikini or wear it under any number of crop tops for some added glitz. Forget other jewelry trends of the season: This summer is all about the beachy body bling.Bieber’s chain was covered in diamonds and costs more than a few thousand bucks, so no, it’s not exactly affordable. But you can still get the look for less! I was able to source a few inexpensive options for you to buy right now if you are trying to copy her blingy bikini vibes.

Your Love of All Things Tropical Can Officially Extend into the Jewelry Sphere,"When I was a wee elementary schooler, nothing—and I meannothing—made me feel as cool as I did when I wore an anklet. The early-aughts anklets trend empowered me to feel like a beach beauty and badass surfer girl rolled into one. As I lived in middle Tennessee, I was basically never wearing an anklet on or near the beach (or really, anywhere other than Kroger or Target). But I feltcool. I felttransported. I felt like the kind of fashion-forward 8-year-old I knew I was every time I spent hours styling and re-styling my Polly Pocket dolls. 2019’s take on the anklets trend has basically left me feeling the exact same way.These days, my time outdoors is no longer spent near-exclusively at Kroger and Target. And my time spent indoors is no longer spent near-exclusively styling Polly Pocket dolls. (Don’t fret—I’ve been sans Polly Pocket since middle school. You are not reading a fashion story penned by a 25-year-old who still plays with dolls.) I am still in middle Tennessee, so decidedly far from basically any beach—leaving me anything but a beach beauty or badass surfer girl (or some endlessly cool hybrid of the two). I’m an editor who spends her days writing in coffeeshops, working out at the YMCA and—when I’m feeling fancy—eating at Nashville’s trendiest restaurants. None of these settings lend themselves particularly well to anklets, especially now that I’m a 25-year-old with a full-time job andnot an elementary schooler who can basically wear anything she damn well pleases.It’s been challenging, then, for me to wrap my head around the 2019 anklet renaissance. As a fan of basically every retro revival to hit the zeitgeist, I’m predisposed to love it. But as a bona fide adult with a 9-to-5, I’m perplexed as to how—and where—to wear it. Anklets’ beachy connotations leave them feeling ill-fit for the office—let alone any semi-fancy affair, like a party or nice dinner. But I’ve reached a simple conclusion: Anklets are simply too fun to overthink. They’re abundantly on offer in every fast-fashion retailer imaginable, they’re priced competitively, and they’refun. They still make me feel cool and fashion-forward, even if I haven’t figured out their best sartorial application. And they still transport me—just in a slightly different way. Instead of making me feel like my toes are in the sand, they make me feel like my toes are in the fluffy carpet that lined the floors of the house where I grew up—or in a pair of jelly sandals, following my mom’s grocery cart as she darted from aisle to aisle at Kroger.Nostalgia is a beautiful thing.

These Etsy Valentine's Day Gifts Put Chocolates & Flowers To Shame,"These ain’t your grandma’s pearls! The pearl jewelry trend blowing up this season is all about adding modern twists to the classic strand. We’re talking statement earrings, mismatched sizes and plenty of stackable rings. After tons of pearls were spotted at the inauguration ceremony this week, I realized just how badly I wanted a strand of my own. The second I typed “pearls” into Google, though, hundreds of options popped up. I should have figured that just about everyone in the world would want some, too.Pearls are often typecast as stuffy, but the look received a revival via TikTok when Gen-Z fashion gurus started showing off their Vivienne Westwood necklaces as the finishing touch to their cool-girl vintage ‘fits. The VW versions retail for hundreds of dollars and are pretty much sold out everywhere at the moment, but there are tons of other trendy brands selling pearls right now to consider. Brands like Mejuri, Missoma and Maison Irem sell alternatives that I can actually afford and totally love, so it looks like I’ll be purchasing more than a few pieces this season.Surprisingly, real pearls on their own aren’t all that expensive, so this use this trend as the perfect excuse to treat yourself without breaking the bank. Whether you opt for a string of real pearls or go for an authentic-looking (and cheaper) imitation version, you’re gonna want to wear these pieces with everything.Keep reading if you’re ready to think of this classic style in a whole new light.

We're Living For All The Statement Necklaces On The Oscars Red Carpet,"As someone who was never an avid jewelry wearer growing up (I also attribute this to my horrible taste in fashion — early 2000s kids will know), I’ll be the first to admit that when I heard of using jewelry as an heirloom, I was a bit confused. I mean, why not leave me a house or better yet, a briefcase full of cash? But then I received a present from my mother for Christmas. It was a ring and I was instantly in love — it’s also a much more practical gift than a briefcase of cash. I thought to myself, this is a ring I will wear forever, as it’s simple, classy, and timeless. So timeless in fact that I thought, “this is a staple piece I could hopefully pass down to my future kids.”Passing down jewelry from generation to generation is not a new concept, but it is one that I feel isn’t as prominent as it used to be. Maybe that’s because the jewelry trends have changed so much throughout the years, we wouldn’t be seen wearing something from the early 1900s. Or perhaps, you’re more inclined to wear vintage clothing rather than vintage jewelry (no judgment, here!). Either way, I am 100% prepared to make the case for why jewelry is the way to go when it comes to keeping something in the family. If you’re a skeptic, buckle up because, by the end of this article, I’ll make a jewelry heirloom believer out of you.It helps preserve memoriesOur loved ones unfortunately aren’t going to be around forever. Luckily, we have ways of remembering them, whether it be our memories, old photographs, the names we choose to give (I can attest to this as my middle name is my grandmother’s name), and of course, jewelry. If you consider yourself a fashionista already starting to think about your legacy and how you want future generations to remember you, passing down a timeless infinity bracelet will ensure you’re always known as “the one in the family who had great style.”Pandora.   Pandora Moments Infinity Knot Snake…$85     Buy Now Things always come back in styleLet’s face it — trends always come back in style. Round glasses? Check. Wide-leg pants? Check. Thin eyebrows? Check (unfortunately). My point is if you think those earrings you’re thinking of passing down won’t be in, come 20 years from now, chances are you’re mistaken. Trust me, I’ve seen firsthand how fashion has evolved over time and one thing’s for sure — fashion always makes a comeback. Take the Sparkling Halo Heart Hoop Earrings from Pandora for example. They’re giving me early 1900s Titanic Hope Diamond vibes and I am so here for it.Pandora.   Sparkling Halo Heart Hoop Earrings$115     Buy Now It’s practical andsentimentalJewelry is something we’ll actually wear if passed down (as opposed to a ball gown). Whether you’re going to work, a fancy event, or spending an evening out with friends, accessories are the perfect addition to an outfit. And if you’re wearing (or decide to pass down) a piece of jewelry to or from a family member, that piece will always hold some sentimental value. One practical, yet stylish Pandora jewelry piece is its Sparkling Tennis Bracelet. It makes the perfect gift for any occasion given its history dating back to the 80s, and one that anyone would be thrilled to wear for years.Pandora.   Sparkling Tennis Bracelet$115     Buy Now It’s valuableBecause it’s a family heirloom that is passed down, that means it only needs to be paid for by the initial wearer. It’s no secret that jewelry can get expensive (think thousands of dollars), which is why passing a piece down generations is a thoughtful gesture.

Sparkling Round Halo Ring$115     Buy Now You can make something new from itFun fact: any piece of jewelry can be repurposed or redesigned into a brand new piece. So, if you’re looking to make your grandmother’s old diamond earrings into a ring, or earrings into a necklace, it is possible. If not, there are plenty of jewelers out there who know how to clean and repair old items. Until then, enjoy the staple pieces like these 14k gold-plated stud earrings with clear cubic zirconia while you can until you pass them on for the next person in your family to wear.Pandora.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashiansstar debuted baby Stormi’s latest look on the ‘gram, only to be met with a barrage of criticism over the hoops. Clearly, plenty of these commenters never had their ears pierced as babies (a practice that is commonplace inmanycultures and communities). Or even if they did; some appear to just be trolling the star and her daughter, for hate’s sake.The toddler, who recently celebrated her second birthday with Kylie and dad Travis Scott, didn’t seem bothered. Yet concerned citizens weighed in via Instagram’s comments section, levying cries of abuse and Stormi acting too “grown-up” for these big, bad hoops (which, lest we forget to mention, are even personalized with her name).One user went so far as to suggest that Stormi could face undeserved criticism for looking “ghetto” with these earrings. “lil sis this little baby is cute… however she’s too young for earrings this size…” wrote Instagram user @antoniamoore9229.“From a mother of another black girl…we don’t put earrings on our little girls that size and style because we don’t want people to talk about our kids in negative ways…and calling our children ghetto,” the user added. “she’s an adorable little girl…please save the earrings for her until she’s 12 or 15 years old.” Um.         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Kylie 🤍 (@kyliejenner)We’re going to chalk that one up to a difference in perspectives. What weshouldbe weighing in on is why anyone would term Black jewelry trends as “ghetto” in the first place, whether or not they’re on a baby (this writer from the Bronx wore hoops as young as Stormi, thank you very much).

Are Sunglasses Lanyards...Cool Now?,"One of the hardest things about shedding the mask post-vaccine, aside from, you know, the trauma of the last 18 months, was wanting to tell the world you’re vaccinated and safe to take off the covering.

The best Covid vaccine merchandise will tell that friend you see on the street that you’re safe to hug and celebrate how freaking cool science is at the same time.Of course, we’re not totally getting rid of masks but when you’re able to not wear one, why not swap it for a beaded bracelet or graphic tee?

Hoop Earrings So Truly Massive You Could Probably Fit Your Head Through Them,"As anyone with an Instagram knows all too well, coin jewelry pervaded the zeitgeist in 2018. Celebrities and “it” girls, alike, adorned their necks with lightweight metal discs meant to look like money—breathing new life into the layered jewelry trend that’s endured for years on end. Though the shell jewelry movement threatened to upend coin jewelry’s reign, it turns out the two aren’t mutually exclusive, after all. Both coin jewelry and shell jewelry are making their way into 2019—offering us a veritable plethora of statement jewelry to choose from.This summer’s coin jewelry trend isn’t the far cry from last year’s you might expect. Coin pendants still abound, leaving minimalists with plenty of ways into the continued trend. But 2019’s coin jewelry movement has seen some maximalist remixes, too. Heavy coin chokers are on offer—so are lengthy chain necklaces, crafted from coin-covered string upon coin-covered string. Now that the aughts have crept into our day-to-day, coin belts are seeing some traction too. As are coin statement earrings—and layered necklaces that capitalize on both the coin jewelry trend and its competitor, the shell jewelry trend, at once.All this is to say: Your favorite retailers have ensured that it’s never too late to hop aboard the coin jewelry bandwagon. If last year’s trend came and went before you had a chance to wrap your sartorial mind around it, you’re in luck, because you still have a whopping season (who knows—maybe even more) to embrace coin jewelry in all its shiny glory.1.

"47 Out-of-the-Box Pearl Pieces to Shop, Because Can You Ever Have Too Many Pearls?","Ah, fall fashion. I couldn’t love it more if I tried! Fall is definitely my favorite season when it comes to styling, as I can combine my favorite aspects of winter (like chic jackets and fun layering) and summer (like showing some skin and playing with color) to create an especially dreamy wardrobe. This season, I really want to go all out, so I’m shopping the top fall fashion trends early to get ahead of the game.What’s in, you ask? The classics. Oversized blazers and slacks will be making a highly anticipated return but this year, they’re joined by cozy striped sweaters and ballet flats (cue gasp). Yes, ballet flats! The shoe we all thought was doomed to being an early 2000’s fashion faux pas has made a triumphant comeback. Hopefully, you’re ready to give them a second turn.Denim is also eager for a reinvention beyond baggy jeans and jackets and is coming in at full force in dress form. I dare you to layer a denim tank dress over a striped sweater (it’ll be amazing).As for accessories, maximalist jewelry is still all the rage. Statement pendants are the coolest way to express yourself this season. Keep reading for the cutest options on the market.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do. Mejuri and Urban Outfitters are STYLECASTER sponsors, however, all products in this article were independently selected by our editors. Please note that if you purchase something by clicking on a link within this story, we may receive a small commission of the sale.Super Oversized PantsWhen it comes to fall bottoms, the baggier the pant, the better. Just ask Hailey Bieber, who’s always seen in a new pair of parachute pants when she’s off duty or supporting Justin at a show. This trend is a callback to the ’90s and we’re here for it. Especially when it’s paired with a tighter top to balance out the weight of the ensemble. Even better: basically any shoe looks good with these bottoms. Ballet flats, chunky sneakers, boots, trainers you name it.Courtesy of Urban Outfitters.Balloon Cargo PantsGet the look of cargo pants with the comfort of cotton bottoms when you wear these balloon trousers. This pair from Urban Outfitters comes in so many unique colorways that will help you add a pop of color to whatever outfit you’ve got planned. In our opinion, the bolder and brighter you go, the better.   iets frans… Balloon Cargo Pant$75     Buy Now Courtesy of Everlane.The Way-High Drape PantYes, it’s possible to bring the baggy pants trend to the office. Case in point: these checkered bottoms from Everlane. They still give your legs the freedom to move around unrestricted but have a bit more structure to them so that HR would approve.   The Way-High Drape Pant$128     Buy Now Sailor StripesStripes are a pattern that comes in so many widths, colors, and formats that it never goes out of style—unlike cheetah print which runs in just as fast as it runs out. However, there are moments where stripes break out of their preppy affiliation and find their way into every aesthetic. This is one of those moments. Sailor-style stripes in the classic navy and white pairing are about to be hanging over every fashionable set of shoulders this fall. The pattern looks great in a loose-knit weave sweater, long sleeve t-shirt or even on a blazer. Pro tip: always check the men’s selection of sweaters if you love an oversized look.Courtesy of Mango.Striped Knit SweaterIs it a little too early to be wearing a full-on sweater? Yes. Will you be dreaming of this sweater the second temperatures hit 50 degrees? Also, yes. Make the move and get this cuffed sweater in anticipation of cooler days ahead. This chocolate version is available in sizes XXS-4X.   Striped Knit Sweater $59.99     Buy Now Courtesy of Cos.Knitted Half Zip SweaterIf you were obsessed with the summer edition of the coastal grandmother esthetic, then you need a half-zip to keep the fun going through the fall.

Knitted Half Zip Sweater$135     Buy Now Ballet FlatsBallet flats have been trying to make a comeback for a few seasons but I’m here to report that it’s finally show time. Now before you decide this trend isn’t for you, I beg you to take a deep breath and let go of the grudge you have against ballet flats. I promise that nobody is asking you to wear them with skinny jeans or a skater skirt. Instead, picture yourself wearing them with linen slacks, chic midi skirts, vintage denim and even a low-rise mini skirt. Cool right? I’m so excited to embrace this trend and become the shining star of Balletcore.Courtesy of Zara.Bow Trim Leather Ballet FlatsLeave it to Zara to have the coolest (and most affordable) version of the trend. This pair of metallic ballet flats are a great maximalist take on the trend. They also come in pink and black.

The Chicest Fall Accessories Trends—and Ways to Shop Them All,"Anyone who knows me well will not be surprised to hear that tropical jewelry sits at the intersection of everything I love about fashion. The tropical print revival has long been one of my favorite trends, as its roots in “ugly” fashion run deep. Call me ascetic, but few things sound more fun than digging up some fascinating, by-all-contemporary-definitions ugly piece of clothing and rendering it trendy, chic, covetable. Nothing—not even a shirt embraced only by frat bros and dads on vacation—can trump creative styling. Tropical prints are fun, and unexpected, and challenging. And statement jewelry is delightfully campy no matter what form it’s taking. 2019’s tropical jewelry trend, then, is a marriage of two lovely, lovely things.Summer 2019 has, by all measures, really only just begun—but it’s already seen an array of statement jewelry trends enter the zeitgeist. Fruit jewelry has shown us our taste buds and our taste in clothing have more in common than we’d think. Last year’s shell jewelry trend is back and perhaps even more eye-catching than ever. And the somewhat recent friendship bracelet trend has reminded us all of the importance of wearing our hearts on our sleeves (or really, on our wrists). Tropical jewelry is joining a vast and varied cast of statement-making players—all of which are sitting idly by on digital shelves, just waiting to add a healthy dose of personality (and a trendy dose of camp) to your accessories arsenal.Though some of this season’s other jewelry trends are limited in terms of form (friendshipbracelets, for instance), tropical jewelry spans genres. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a necklace person, or an earrings person, or awhatever person—you’re sure to find a trendy piece that’ll work for you (though it bears mentioning that tropical earrings are particularly abundant). So what are you waiting for? I’m serving you a veritable plethora of ways to keep your love of the tropics close to heart and mind at all times—all you have to do is scroll down.1.

All the Spring Flats We're Eyeing Right Now,"And the award goes to…the STATEMENT NECKLACE! If you didn’t have time to watch the Oscars red carpet, I hate to break it to you, but you missed a lot of great looks. To bring you up to speed, allow me to present the number one Oscars 2020 jewelry trend: Necklaces.The abundance of statement necklaces on the carpet positively blew me away, and it seemed like everyone from Janelle Monae to Florence Pugh had a neck drenched in diamonds. Even though these celebs wowed in dresses that were eye-catching all on their own, many chose to couple them with chunky necklaces that were just as impressive, and it’s an accessory trick I’ll most definitely be copying for my next night-out look.Check out the biggest and blingiest necklaces of the night below, as well as a few glitzy options for trying out the look yourself.Photo: ShutterstockJanelle MonaeJanelle Monae’s spectacular hooded gown is the kind of dress that needs no accessorizing, and yet she took things one step further with a blinged-out choker to match her sparkling ensemble.Photo: ShutterstockMindy KalingMindy Kaling’s necklace isn’t just gorgeous— it’s ex$pensive. During her red carpet interview, Kaling told Ryan Seacrest that she had to have a bodyguard accompany her all night just to make sure it was safe! The Zaxie To the Moon and Back CZ Tennis Necklace gives off the same dripping-in-diamonds vibes, but at just under $100, it’s likely quite a bit more affordable than Kaling’s priceless piece.Photo: ZaxieZaxie CZ Tennis Necklace$95Buy NowPhoto: ShutterstockZazie BeetzZazie Beets wins my vote for Best Statement Necklace of the night. This thing is major, people! The diamond and emerald masterpiece truly belongs in a museum.Photo: David Fisher/ShutterstockGreta GerwigGreta Gerwig joined Zazie in rocking an emerald-and-diamond look, and the gorgeous green gems really made her eyes pop. If you’re vining with these emerald looks, consider rocking the Charter Club Crystal Collar Necklace for just under $40.Photo: Macy’sCharter Club Crystal Collar Necklace$39.50Buy NowPhoto: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP/ShutterstockKristin CavallariKristin Cavallari’s matching necklace and earring combo has inspired me to start buying all my jewelry in sets. So good!Photo: ShutterstockLily SinghLily Singh scrapped the diamond approach worn by so many other celebs and instead layered two pearl necklaces with a chunky golden chain. To copy Singh’s look, try the BaubleBar Duo Pearl Choker Necklace, which can be doubled up on the neck for a similar layered look.Photo: BaubleBarBaubleBar Duo Pearl Choker Necklace$44Buy NowPhoto: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP/ShutterstockFlorence PughThank heavens my queen, Florence Pugh, has signed off on the statement necklace trend. Now I can really love it. Hers featured a massive teardrop-shaped ruby to contrast the turquoise color of her gown.Photo: Broadimage/ShutterstockJulia Louis-DreyfusSpaghetti straps are typically thought of as a casual silhouette, so Julia Louis-Dreyfus dressed hers up with diamonds, natch. The Cristabelle Crystal Baguette Thick Collar Necklace does a good job of mimicking Louis-Dreyfus’s necklace’s perfect balance of blingy, but not too over-the-top sparkle.

71 of the Best Spring Statement Earrings Money Can Buy,"Surely it would surprise no one to hear me call name tags a necessary evil. No onewants to adorn themselves with a glorified human label—an adhesive one that ruins their outfit, no less.But. One of 2019’s most visible sartorial movements—the name jewelry trend—has called this logic into question. Maybe we don’t mind wearing glorified human labels. Maybe we enjoy adorning ourselves with our names. Maybe welike accessories that do the talking—or at least, the introducing—for us.In its first iteration, the name jewelry trend was perhaps most iconically sported by two abject style goddesses: Carrie Bradshaw (of fictionalSex and the City fame) and Princess Diana. Diana was spotted, on many occasions, sporting a short necklace emblazoned with the letter D. And asSATC fans know well, Carrie wore a “Carrie” necklace throughout the show’s tenure. (The necklace even became a central plot point in one episode.) This trend, as all trends are wont to do, trickled out of the zeitgeist. And then it trickled back in. Name jewelry is now available in basically every jewelry format—earrings, chokers, bracelets, hair accessories—and basically every name format, too (which is really just to say, you can go to Diana initial route, or the Carrie full-name route).And those who find themselves a bit put off by the whole wearing their name 24/7 thing can rest assured knowing a sub-iteration of the trend has re-emerged, alongside the name jewelry one.Word jewelry—accessories inscribed with various words (notnecessarily names)—is as abundantly on offer as name jewelry is. You can sport your favorite curse word. Or announce how #blessed you are to the world. You can don jewelry that renders you a self-proclaimed queen. Hell, you can even wear Marc Jacob’s name in hoop earring form, if that were ever a thing you’d dreamt of.So crack open a dictionary and remind yourself of all your favorite words. Odds are, they’re currently available in accessory form, just waiting to be sported by the likes of you.[sc-button price=”85″ url=”https://www.shopbop.com/logo-hoop-marc-jacobs/vp/v=1/1513051330.htm” title=”Marc Jacobs The Logo Hoops”]We weren’t kidding when we said the Marc Jacobs thing.

"Opal Jewelry to Shop, Because Iridescent Is the New Black","You’ve likely already stocked up on cute, Instagram-worthy face masks these last few months, so let’s take it a step further and add some mask accessories, shall we? What started this past spring as a hunt for cloth face masks (any cloth face masks) turned into a hunt for pretty cloth face masks—which, in turn, became a hunt for ways to make wearing said masks more fun. Enter: mask straps, chains and other accessories that turn your (necessary) face mask into a full-blown lewk.If you’re skeptical about adding accessories—and, in particular, achain—to your mask, I hear you. But these beauts aren’t your grandma’s glasses chain. Both chunkyand dainty chains and straps have had a major comeback (They look really cute on sunglasses, FYI!), and the trend has transitioned seamlessly to work with all your favorite face masks. Typically, you just clip the accessories onto your mask and go! Before you know it, your safety measure will become a vital part of your outfit.Of course, there are chains and other mask accessories forall types of styles. You could opt for a pearl-adorned mask chain to give your mask a bit of a 1920s or preppy vibe, for one. Or, pair your simple black face mask with a colorful mask to spice things up. You can also go with a classic gold link mask chain, too—especially if you’re really into 2020’s jewelry trends. And if chains aren’t your thing, there are headbands and hair clips to help you keep your mask looking cute AF as well! Quite frankly, there are almosttoomany options—so we narrowed them down for you.Below, you’ll find 12 cute mask accessories to shop.

Shop The Exact Gummy Bear Ring From Olivia Rodrigo's New 'Brutal' Video,"Each year brings with it several trendy retro revivals—most cyclical, most expected. Trends come and go, and then come back again; such is the way the sartorial world works, and we’re typically excited to see old favorites making a comeback. But every so often, a vintage trend creeps into the zeitgeist and sees a resurgence none of us could have possibly predicted. Such was the case with dad sneakers, tropical prints and the enduring bike short. And now, sunglasses chains (known by many as sunglasses lanyards) are seeing a similar treatment.Earlier this month, a Free People representative told StyleCaster that sunglasses lanyards—chains that attach to the sides of your sunglasses and drape behind your head, like a backwards necklace—were poised to be big come summer 2019. And the summer accessories that retailers have on offer have only backed up this assertion. Nasty Gal, Urban Outfitters and Free People are littered with chains meant to adorn your sunglasses (or even your regular glasses), because in the age of maximalism, everything deserves a little accessorizing.We get it—this is oneseriously strange trend. Eyeglass chains feel classically vintage, whereas lanyards reek of frat bro origins. This is one odd couple that never deserved a meet-cute. Yet they got one, and when the result of this union is as sophisticated-yet-unabashedly-fun as sunglasses chains are, it’s kind of hard to be mad, no?1.

101 Festival-Ready Pieces Worth Shopping Right Now,"Jewelry trends are among the strangest around. In 2018, we thought it advisable to hang faces from our ears. So far in 2019, we’ve grown attached to adorning ourselves with glorified nametags, sporting fruit-shaped baubles of all kinds and extending our tropical print obsession into the accessory sphere. We’ve also taken our mild obsession with hoop earrings to a new level; the hoop earrings trend has become the big hoop earrings trend, which has since become thetruly massive hoop earrings trend. A huge hoop is simply not an adequately huge hoop unless it’s huge enough to stick your entire head through.Our initial resurrection of the hoop earrings trend was a nod to the early aughts, when hoop earrings were as abundant as low-rise jeans, butterfly clips and chainmail. Metallic textiles and shiny embellishments abounded, accentuated by the circular metal hoops we hung from our ears. Though we’ve revived a great many 2000s-inspired sartorial movements, hoops have pervaded the zeitgeist unlike any other (perhaps because they’re a bit more approachable than, say, that iconic sparkly cowl mini that hardly covered Paris Hilton’s body at all). But, as we and our camp-loving hearts are wont to do, we’ve taken hoop earrings to their most voluminous extreme. We’ve demanded that they not only be circles, but that they be enormous circles—gargantuan circles. If a hoop earring isn’t big enough to graze our shoulders—or more dramatically, our collarbones—is it even a hoop earring at all?!We’d be remiss not to admit that wearing truly massive hoop earrings is a power move in its own right. And surely, being able to shove your head through your earring is a pretty impressive party trick. But all we really want to know is: Where will it end? Will we not be satisfied until hoops have become so colossal that we can fit our entire selves through them? That we can hula hoop with them? That we can loop them ’round our houses—nay, our yards? Will hoop earrings continue growing and growing until they envelop our earth?Only time will tell. For now, there is shopping to be done—and there are huge hoop earrings to be had.

The M Jewelers and CASETiFY Just Made *the* Chicest Phone Cases I Ever Did See,"Growing up, pearl jewelry epitomized one thing and one thing only: classic glamour. Pearl pieces were to be paired exclusively with ball gowns and fancy gloves, making them a favorite of mine any time I went to play dress-up. As time went on, though, pearl jewelry was remixed, and then remixed again. It no longer felt exclusively reserved for the upper echelons of society; new iterations left the jewelry trend accessible to any aesthetic. And these days, pearl pieces are almost as commonplace as rhinestones were during the early aughts.Now that we’ve lifted the veil of exclusivity that once barred pearl jewelry from the masses, out-of-the-box pearl pieces have made their way into fast-fashion retailers. Pearl-covered barrettes are on the sartorial menu. So are pearl-lined chokers and pearl-dotted bobby pins. Pearl-covered hoops have offered jewelry designers a way to capitalize on two earring trends at once; the hoop-drop hybrid feels endlessly edgy, no matter how many times it’s done.The best thing about pearl jewelry isn’t its classic appeal or its aesthetic versatility—but the fact that it’s never a bad buy. No one will ever reminisce on the pearl jewelry they’ve purchased with buyer’s remorse or trend-follower’s regret. Pearl pieces are nevernot chic, no matter how out-of-the-box they are. Pearl jewelry is a no-fail purchase, and given the immense variety of unique pearl jewelry on the market right now, there’s never been a better time to stock up.1.

After all, no ensemble is complete without an accessory or two! Thankfully, based on the Fall/Winter 2020 runways, we’re in for a pretty stylish season—with accessory trends spanning all kinds of categories. From edgy to ladylike to literal cowboy vibes, welcome to the Wild West of fall accessory trends, y’all.Of course, I couldn’t complete this lineup without an homage to fall 2020’s best accessory trend of all: the face mask. More than a trend, it’s an essential—but that doesn’t mean you can’t love the way yours looks. Brands are dropping cute face masks left and right, not to mention accessories like mask chains and charms, so make sure to get at least one you really love. Who wants to create a perfectly-curated outfit and then finish it off with just any old mask, am I right?Don’t worry, though; not all the fall accessory trends on this list are pandemic-related. On our heads, we’ll be wearing everything from berets to bandanas, and in our arms, we’ll be toting ladylike purses or handbags with slouchy, scrunched straps. And as for jewelry, the return of the statement earring has finally (!) come, along with an abundance of chunky chains and charms galore.If you thought you were going to get away with wearing a basic sweater-and-denim combo this fall without properly accessorizing, you were sorely mistaken. Read on for ways to shop this season’s top trends and see which piques your fancy.

"Trust Us, You Don't Want To Sleep On This Jewelry Trend","Tortoise shell is a classic pattern marked by its multifaceted neutral coloration and patch-worked array of various tones of brown and taupe. We’re used to seeing tortoise motifs in eyewear and well, cats, but this season, we’re making the case for extending the timeless decorative design beyond its prevailing appearance in eyewear and into new territories. It’s official: Tortoise shell accessories are here, and they’re more varied than ever before.Versatile yet distinctive, tortoise designs have long offered a skin tone-flattering colorway—one that’s become a staple in our go-to cat-eye sunnies and our favorite pairs of prescription frames (you know, the ones that magically upgrade any 9-to-5 office ensemble or lazy Sunday library look). But why not bring the universally-flattering and timelessly classic tortoise shell pattern into your other accessories, as well?Tortoise shell has been making its way into jewelry—and even hair accessories as of late—and we’re more than happy to embrace the trend. And if you’re looking for a larger-scale way to join the tortoise shell accessories movement,you’re in luck because pattern is currently popping up in footwear and handbags as well.Consider tortoise shell a neutral—but an exciting, maximalist one.

"Layer Up, Kids—The Top 2022 Jewelry Trends Are Here","Something about spring just makes us want to shoe-shop. (Maybe the fact that we’ve been wearing the same damn pair of snow boots every day since October?? Maybe??) Now that we’re shedding layers, trading sweaters for T-shirts and whipping out our favorite relaxed jeans on the reg, we’re in dire need of footwear that feels as fresh as our spring wardrobes. That means spring heels, spring wedges and spring flats in every possible shape, texture and color. Budgets, beware—we’re coming for these shoe stores, and we’re coming for them hard.We’d be lying if we said spring flats were the first thing we thought to stock up on this season. Once we handled our sundress and swimsuit situation, we moved into top-of-mind accessory domains—namely, spring heels and wedges. Heels feel party-worthy and wedges feel vacation-worthy. In other words, they’refun, and once winter starts to wear off, we can’t bear the thought of practicality any longer. But. Once it gets hot out, no one has the energy to run around in heels and wedges all day—at least, we don’t. So when we’re getting dressed in the morning, we never find ourselves reaching for the spring heels and wedges we just bought. Those are occasion pieces, not everyday ones—and that’s exactly why spring flats are so vital.Flats get kind of a bad rap. Like we said, flats tend to get lumped in with other practical necessities—leaving them feeling kind of, well, un-fun. But the current selection of spring flats is anything but. Seriously, some of the mules, sandals and loafers on offer at your favorite retailers right now are seriously cute—cuter than some of the spring heels we’ve seen this season, and definitely cute enough to warrant a spot in your fun rotation. If you’ll let them, spring flats will elevate even the laziest of spring ensembles, and they’ll keep you comfortable while they’re at it. That’s a sartorial win/win if we’ve ever seen one. So give spring flats a chance (and a quick perusal), won’t you?1. All Black Colorblocked Slides, $149 at AnthropologieThe easiest way to dress up a tee-and-jeans combo? Slip into these.2. Fabric Moroccan Barbouches, $49.90 at ZaraWho needs beach sandals when you can wear these woven flats, instead?3.

5 Summer Jewelry Trends That Work From The Beach To Happy Hour,"Take a look at Urban Outfitter’s summer 2019 collection, and you’ll see a veritable plethora of trendy wares. Every piece seems more vibrant, more personality-filled, more retro-referential than the next.

"Five 2021 Jewelry Trends To Invest In, From Pendants To Pearls","Statement earrings are always a good idea. But spring statement earrings are an even better one. Because no matter what day it is or what the weather’s doing outside, adorning your head with colorful, personality-filled baubles is just plain fun.But if it’s a Friday and it’s sunny outside and you’re adorning your head with colorful, personality-filled baubles, you’ve basically hit a fun jackpot. Warmth, the weekend and cute AF statement jewelry is a trifecta that truly cannot be beat.Naturally, shopping spring statement earrings has become one of our favorite pastimes in recent months. The moment the spring equinox came and went, we traded our go-to black Chelsea boots for fresh white sneakers, we swapped our sleekest black skinnies for relaxed mom jeans, and we dropped our sophisticated silver hoops to make room for, well, every pair of spring statement earrings we laid eyes on. During winter, minimalism reigns, so accessories are pretty easy to manage. But during spring and summer, maximalism comes out to play, leaving the statement jewelry landscape vaster and more varied than ever.Color is on the menu. So are kitschy shapes. So is every combination of beads and pearls and rhinestones you can possibly imagine. It’s not enough to render hoops in glitter-infused resin—you have to cover them in beads that boast paint strokes in every shade of the rainbow. Dream up a truly strange pair of spring statement earrings, and get ready to whip out your credit card—because they probably already exist. Whether you’re a fan of drop, hoop, stud or evenclip-on styles, there’s at least one pair of spring statement earrings designed with you in mind. Honestly, there are probably a few.So drop those dainty hoops and shelve your favorite studs for a while. Your go-to spring outfits are simply canvases for all the exciting accessories that await you. Stock up—and start playing.1.

13 Ways To Start Wearing Spring's Enamel Jewelry Trend Right Now,"Humans will never be mermaids. Or fairies. Or unicorn queens. Or the myriad other fantastic creatures that inspire our aesthetics, our Halloween costumes, our dreams. But the enduring iridescence trend has allowed us to get closer to a reality in which we are these dreamy, wonderful things; if we wear enough opal jewelry and drape our homes with enough holographic textiles, maybe—even if just for a moment—we can live out the fantasies that inhabit our imaginations.Dreams of modern-day fairytales aside, it’s impossible to look upon our modern-day love of all things iridescent with anything but absolute mesmerization. Mostly because, well, the trend is pretty damn mesmerizing. There’s something endlessly beautiful about the blend of purples, aquas and millennial pinks—the way iridescence reflects and captures light simultaneously, the depth of color that changes oh-so subtly every time you move your eyes. It’s hardnot to access the most imaginative portals of your mind every time you lay eyes on an iridescent bauble. Everything from holographic shower curtains to iridescent water bottles captivates the brain—with genuinely precious pieces, like opal jewelry, feeling the most bewitching at all.My aesthetic doesn’t lend itself well to iridescence. I’m a bright colors, bold prints, tactile-y grounded maximalist; iridescence’s airy beauty only gets lost when thrown into my heavy atmosphere. But even I can’t resists its charms. I’m as apt as anyone else to spend hours perusing shiny things—combing through the internet’s selection of truly stunning opal jewelry—simply because it’s a beautiful way to pass the time. So whether or not you’re on the market for a new iridescent ring, take a moment and lose yourself in a veritable sea of stunning opal jewelry.

Mejuri's New Enamel Rings Nail 2021's Hottest Jewelry Trend,"I’m not one to say “I told you so,” but when I brought BONBONWHIMS to StyleCaster readers’ attention back in April, I knew it was the next big jewelry It Brand. Major fashionistas and celeb tastemakers like Kylie Jenner and Sofia Richie were already wearing the brand’s creative, colorful pieces—and slowly but surely, it’s amassed even more majorly famous fans. As I watched and re-watched the new music video for “Brutal,” I couldn’t help but notice Olivia Rodrigo’s jewelry in one particular scene.The “Brutal” video is, among other things, fantastic. In my opinion, it’s one of the best returns to music video-ing at its core that we’ve seen in a hot minute. And just as good as the concept and storytelling, of course, are the outfits. With portions of her face covered by virtual masks reminiscent of Instagram and Snapchat face filters, Rodrigo let her attire and accessories do the talking for the bulk of the video. That said, there was one piece in particular that stood out.In the classroom scene, Rodrigo paired a punky plaid skirt and a red tank that says “Flirt” with a red beret and braided pigtails. Finishing off the look, she rocked some silver oversized soda tab-style earrings by Pattaraphanand a rectangular, glittery red ring with a black gummy bear on top. That ring, of course, was classic BONBONWHIMS.Like it? Boy oh boy, do I have great news for you: You can snag one for yourself! BONBONWHIMS founder Clare Ngai isn’t one to send celebs exclusive pieces and leave their fans wanting something similar—she always makes sure they can get their hands on the real thing. In the past, fans went positively wild for a clear bubble ring worn by Ariana Grande, so I have no doubt that the aptly-named Brutal Ring will be the brand’s next big seller.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do. Please note that if you purchase something by clicking on a link within this story, we may receive a small commission of the sale.Courtesy of BONBONWHIMS.   Brutal Ring$65     Buy Now TBH, even if I wasn’t a fan of Rodrigo I’d want this ring. Gummy bear jewelry has been trending all summer, but I’ve been worried that the Rainbow Brite color scheme so many brands are pushing would wear itself out by fall. A classic emo-chic color combo like black and red never gets old! I love the thought of rocking this with an otherwise understated monochrome black look as a pop of something fun and quirky. Or, you know, as part of my inevitable Olivia Rodrigo Halloween costume.Her BONBONWHIMS ring isn’t the only fun accessory Rodrigo wears in the video; she also rocks some seriously cute (And affordable! Under $50!) chunky gold hoops with flower detailing by Notte, not to mention a bevy of early aughts-inspired hair clips in the final scene. Unrelated, but I’d go as far as to say that Rodrigo is bringing pigtails back. And strangely, I’m here for it?Courtesy of Geffen Records.Bottom line, Rodrigo positively smashed her latest video. I’m thrilled that “Brutal” is her new single! It’s destined to have as much success as “Driver’s License” or “good 4 u,” just as I’m destined to copy her fashion choices and buy myself this gummy bear ring. Someone warn my credit card—it’s brutal out here! "
"2020's Top Jewelry Trends Are All About Drama, So Layer Up","Any solid festival wardrobe involves a combination of a few things: comfy clothes you can move around in all day (and night) long, pieces that are lightweight enough for midday humidity and cozy enough for breezy nights, and chic AF style. This last bit is, of course, the most fun part of this endeavor—and it’s the thing that leaves the festival clothes landscape feeling as delightful, exciting and Instagram-worthy as it does. It’s also the thing that makes me want to shop festival clothes, even though I’m not planning on attending a single festival this year.When I went to Bonnaroo some many years ago, my priority was fashion—not function. I spent my days in delightfully bohemian crop tops and short shorts that made my butt look excellent—until they rode up so significantly they basically served as a second pair of underwear. The versatile gladiators I relied on to tie my outfits together split apart halfway through the fest, leaving me in something of a footwear rut. (But hey—Bonnaroo’s an alternately dusty or muddy experience, and I simply wasn’t prepared to sacrifice any of my clean AF sneakers to the festival gods.) I wore rainbow snapbacks, adorned my hair with flower crowns and layered on Free People jewelry. My looks were photogenic as hell—but my head got seriously hot and sweaty, and I’m just not the kind of person who can stand to bounce around in beaded shit all day. By the end of the four days, I was basically relying on sports bras, tie-dye tanks and Nike shorts—a far cry from the fashion-forward looks I’d mentally assembled, but a much more practical option that kept me from getting distracted by my clothing every 19 seconds.I’ve been to a handful of festivals since then, and it’s become clear to me that the dichotomy between fashion and function is a false one—at least as far as festival clothes are concerned. The festival clothing selection is incredibly vast, and it’s full of pieces that are as practical as they are pretty (or weird, or statement-making, or breezy, or whatever other aesthetic you’re currently cultivating). Comfort and chic style are far from mutually exclusive; it’s entirely possible to craft a festival wardrobe fully of comfy clothes, and lightweight-yet-cozy necessities and head-turning looks. It’s, in fact, so possible (and so damn fun) that I’ve found myself planning festival outfits I won’t be able to wear any time soon—leaving you, dear reader, with a comprehensive guide to all the festival clothes worth shopping right now.1.

"This Spring, Shell Pendants Might Just Replace Last Year’s Coin Jewelry Obsession","You’ve slipped on your favorite dress, slid on a pair of kitten heels, and slicked your hair back into the perfect bun. You’re almost ready to walk out the door but your look is missing one major thing: details. Whether you identify with the “less is more” or “more is more” school of thought regarding fashion, both parties can agree that the best outfits include some kind of accessory. Summer’s jewelry trends have been solidified (and spoiler alert: they’ll easily last through the fall) and they’re just what you need to add that extra dazzling detail to your outfit.One of my favorite things about jewelry trends is that they aren’t as volatile as fashion trends. High-quality jewelry usually has sentimental value and also often comes with a higher price tag. This means that jewelry trends stick around for a more extended period of time because people aren’t looking to part ways with their favorite pieces.I take the personal approach of investing in my everyday staples like a simple gold chain, studs, or name initial ring and then letting myself have fun with less expensive costume jewelry. I also think finding inspiration from your friends and family is helpful. For example, my mom has a gold coin jewelry set that she’s worn throughout the last 20 years. The set makes a statement and has never gone out of style—I always admire the look of it when she wears it so I’d be willing to invest in a similar piece!The top jewelry trends this summer fall into the investment and trend categories. For example, the chain link necklaces, sleek silver hoops, and floral jewelry all have incredible longevity. If they tire out at any point, you know they’ll always eventually come back. On the trendier end, we have charm bracelets and initial necklaces. Both of these trends are meant to be customized which makes them great gift options—fashion is always more fun when you can share it with a friend.iMaxTree.1. FloralsFlorals are often associated with summer dresses or the tablescape at a dinner party, but the trend is in full bloom in the accessories sphere. Floral earrings are especially having a moment and are a fun twist on the whimsical look of tucking a flower behind your ear. The style works with statement earrings, flower-encrusted hoops or bracelet charms.iMaxTree.2. Sleek Silver HoopsOk if you haven’t caught on by now, all the hot girls and guys are wearing silver hoops. Big or small, stacked or single, silver hoops are still the coolest thing you can put in your ears (sorry Airpods). Feel free to mix metals and add a combination of silver and gold to your ear stack.iMaxTree.3. Chain Link NecklacesYou’re going to want to link up with this jewelry trend—literally. Chain link necklaces are the perfect everyday accessory and can be customized to your lifestyle. For example, I wear two delicate link chain necklaces every day that add subtle detail to my outfitsandI don’t have to take them on and off to sleep, shower, etc. You can choose how heavy you want the metal to be, how many you want to layer and if you want to add charms to your stack.iMaxTree.4. Initial JewelryJewelry is so personal and the initial and name jewelry trend proves it! Wearing a customizable name necklace, initial ring or both is a fun way to make a “this is me!” statement. Initial jewelry can also be a meaningful way to show your connection to someone else—whether it’s your significant other, parent or child’s initials, adding a piece to your collection will keep them close to you all day.Getty Images.5. Charm BraceletsCharm bracelets are back and better than ever. Tap into early 2000’s nostalgia with a decked-out charm bracelet on your wrist. Charms are a fun way to show off your niche interests, give your friend a meaningful gift, celebrate a memory or create a #twinning moment. "
Kitschy Fruit Jewelry Is All Over Instagram & I'm Fully Embracing It," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.It’s easy to get caught up in revamping your wardrobe to fit the season’s latest trends. But between the cut-outs, faux fur coats, low-rise jeans, and dip-dye, the fashion trends may begin to seem overwhelming when the outfit options become endless. When you’re standing in the dressing room of Zara trying to determine which item to purchase, let me remind you that jewelry is often what makes and completes an outfit. So keep your fashion simple, grab your favorite black sweater or white button-down and shift your energy to focus on the jewelry trends for 2023. From simple silver hoops to bold bangles, there’s a jewelry trend to add a little extra flair to any look.While clothing always tells a story, jewelry is considered to be more personal. You may already have a signature piece that you wear every day or something with deep sentimental value. Oftentimes, these personally valuable pieces lean on the side of individual taste more than a trend, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do both. The best part of jewelry? Layers, stacks and statements pieces. The hardest part is picking which pieces to pair together!I interviewed jewelry designer and curator, Stephanie Gottlieb, for an expert opinion on how to play into 2023’s biggest jewelry moments and the key to finding a balance between trendy and timeless.First and foremost, if you’re looking to invest in your personal jewelry collection, it’s best to prioritize purchasing pieces that will maintain quality and value.“I always recommend for a new buyer to start with the classics like diamond studs, a tennis bracelet, or a diamond stack bands and then if you’re wanting to introduce the trendy pieces do that after you’ve already built the wardrobe of the staples,” Gottlieb advises. But when it comes to trendy pieces, Gottlieb says the opposite, “Buy costume to start and upgrade over time as the budget allows. You can sprinkle in less expensive fashion-forward trendy pieces.”Tom Ford; iMaxTree.Her advice seems simple enough—invest in quality, play with quantity! Luckily, 2023’s jewelry trends give you the opportunity to do a bit of both. Classic silver and gold pieces aren’t going anywhere—if anything, they’re getting more popular. If you’ve already built a collection of Hailey Bieber-inspired gold hoops (I sure know I have), consider mixing in some silver metal and vice versa. Don’t be afraid to upgrade your classic metals but simply goingbigger.According to Gottlieb, “We’re going to see a big comeback of the ‘80s and still some of the ‘90s. Think lots of chunky gold jewelry, big hoops and geometric shapes.” Based on the Spring/Summer ‘23 runway shows, Gottlieb is spot on.Keep reading for the five biggest jewelry trends expected to shine throughout 2023 (hey, it’s never too early to start wearing them!).Tory Burch; Jonathan Simkhai, iMaxTree.Totally CuffedA silver or gold cuff is the perfect example of a way to make a subtle statement with just one piece. Cuff bracelets are proving themselves to be the easiest way to elevate any look. The silhouette is often just a thick, arched curve but the impact is big! For starters, cuffs are usually adjustable which means you can wear them in multiple ways. If you prefer a classic look, add a cuff (or two) around your wrist to shine under the sleeve of your shirt or sweater. To make the trend more interesting, slip the cuff up your forearm like the models wore at Missoni, or opt for a wrap-around cuff as seen on the models at Tory Burch.Courtesy of Banana Republic.Hammered Cuff BraceletThis silver cuff has a wave structure to it which will help reflect light and make it super eye-catching. Plus, it’s only $30 so it’s a great way to try out to trend without feeling handcuffed to it.

Oversized silver statement hoops were a staple on the spring/summer ’23 runway and the second I saw Bella Hadid wear them during the Jil Sander show, I was sold. I’m putting my bets in now that she repeats the silver hoops for a street-style moment. Oversized silver hoops are another ’80s trend but they look incredibly modern when paired with 2023’s runway trends. For everyday wear, consider downsizing the hoop size (your ears will thank you) and leave the big guys for special occasions.Courtesy of Stephanie Gottlieb.35mm Tube Hoop EarringsIf you plan on wearing a pair of earrings on a daily basis, it’s definitely worth investing in a pair that won’t irritate your ears or tarnish.

Take notes from Blumarine, the totally Y2 K-inspired brand, and add a charm to a beaded strand, or get inspired by Coach’s quirky decision to add unusual objects to a long strand like a sports whistle. You don’t need to wear a flower crown or long skirt for beads to work with your outfit.Courtesy of Nordstrom.Carabiner Beaded NecklaceSpeaking of unconventional objects, this beaded necklace comes with an adorable carabiner charm and makes the perfect gift for an outdoorsy friend.

Hailey Bieber's Gold Body Chain Makes Her Bikini Look Even Hotter," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.I’m very lucky because my mom is a total fashion icon. When we go shopping together, we almost always leave with matching fashion finds. For this reason, the mother-daughter matching jewelry trend is perfect.I’ve been stealing her clothes, bags and jewelry for as long as I can remember and incorporating them into my own wardrobe. I even got caught trying to bring some of her items to college with me (my mission was unsuccessful). I love the idea of coordinating jewelry because it’s a way to bring everyday sentimental value to both of our looks. It also saves us from being too matchy-matchy and doubles our options (because we obviously still swap pieces).Coordinating jewelry, especially in a mother-daughter sense, doesn’t need to feel like a gimmick. Don’t get me wrong, I was a huge fan of matching friendship bracelets and half-heart necklaces as a kid but I want my grown-up jewelry to feel a little more elevated.Now I look for easy ways to build continuity between our collections. One way this can be done is by focusing on a motif, like the stars or the moon, and finding pieces within that theme. I also love the idea of choosing a stone or jewel and finding jewelry that features the same element.AP Images.Zoë Kravitz and her mom Lisa Bonet do an incredible job of coordinating jewelry in a way that still speaks to their individual personal styles. Kravitz’s gold earrings and body chain compliment Bonet’s bird brooch on her collar and gold hoops.A lot of jewelry brands also have signature styles that they incorporate throughout most of their pieces. By shopping for jewelry from the same brand, there’s a good chance that the design elements will be consistent throughout—you can take a brand’s signature style and make it one you and your mom are known for wearing.AP Images.If being subtle isn’t your thing, take a page out of Kris and Khloe Kardashian’s book and go bold. The Kardashian duo not only wore bright diamond earrings, but coordinated their twisted glitter dresses. This is a fun way to make sure everyone is aware of family ties at functions.Whether you’re pairing earrings and bracelets or rings and necklaces, mother-daughter jewelry is so sweet and sentimental. Mother’s Day is also quickly approaching so this is a great way to get your mom and yourself (for the sake of the trend of course) something special.Keep reading for my favorite coordinating picks.A Pearl PairPerhaps the most classic way to coordinate with your mom is by wearing complementary sets of pearls. Pearl jewelry is a staple of sophisticated style but can also allude to the more carefree fashion of the 1920s. Pearls are currently having a modern resurgence and are being incorporated into heavy chain necklaces, huggie earrings or other gem clusters. This means that even if you are a die-hard Y2K grunge-girl and your mom prefers a classic strand, you can still coordinate jewelry and have a meaningful connection.To The Moon & BackIf you’re into astrology or just love spending a long night under the stars, moon and star-themed jewelry is a great way to connect with your mom and the great unknown. Stars are super on-trend for jewelry right now so it’s easy to find celestial gems to wear. One of you can sport a crescent moon necklace while the other wears sparkly star earring studs (or vice versa) to stick with the theme. If you want to get multiple siblings in on the look, a moon and star charm bracelet is also a fun option for everyone to wear.Diamonds Are Your Mom’s Best FriendYou don’t have to have an heirloom engagement ring to connect to your family with diamonds. Diamonds come in all shapes and sizes which makes them easy to personalize and fun to mix and match. A matching pair of small diamond studs are great for everyday wear and will be a subtle daily reminder of your mom. Having different pieces in the same shape or setting is another way to have a subtle #twinning moment. Diamonds are also available in moissanite and lab-grown alternatives so you don’t have to break the bank to participate. "

I tend to pick a few more expensive pieces of jewelry and wear them for months without taking them off. Because of my long-time commitment to jewelry I end up gravitating towards timeless pieces but recently, the spring jewelry trends for 2022 have caught my eye.Suddenly, I’m interested in switching out my classic gold jewelry for understated silver. Even better, I’ll wear them both at once and be the girl that rocks mixed metals. For special occasions, I’m planning on experimenting with floral texture and pops of color. Spring fashion trends keep getting brighter and brighter so it’s no surprise that jewelry is headed in the same direction.From blingy choker neckalces (yep, they’re back again) inspired by Olivia Rodrigo’s Grammys look to Old Hollywood drop earrings, there are plenty of pieces to up your accessory game.

Kylie Jenner Is Fielding Criticism Over Baby Girl Stormi's Personalized Hoop Earrings,"I’m the type of gal who sticks to a few gold earrings or a simple gold chain and calls it a day, so I never thought I would be one to gravitate toward colorful jewelry. But if 2021 has taught me anything so far, it’s that I should probably branch out and try new things, and my newfound color obsession is making it that easy. Case in point: I have (somehow) fallen head over heels for the enamel jewelry trendthat has been taking over my social media feeds. Luckily for me, these rainbow-brite pieces don’t seem to be going away anytime soon.It all started when I spotted a pair of Mejuri’s enamel hoops while aimlessly browsing the web the other night and instantly fell in love. I thought it was simply because I was tired, so I shut my laptop and tried to forget about them—but I couldn’t. Turns out, that was just the beginning of my enamel jewelry spiral. Now, I’ve found tons of different options at literally every price point imaginable, and they’re all sitting in my cart waiting for me to pull the proverbial trigger and place a slew of orders.So, I’ve rounded up 13 of my favorite pieces of enamel jewelry to share with you, in hopes that I won’t be the only one impulse-shopping. And when I say these price points are good, I mean it!

I seriously miss the days prior to then where I could put on “real” pants and deck myself out in every blingy earring, bracelet and necklace in my jewelry box. Now that we’re starting to go out and about again, hopefully, Mejuri’s brand-new enamel rings can help me get a handle on some of 2021’s biggest jewelry trends.I once thought colorful jewelry was a thing of the past. Sure, I used to stack on bright bangles and plastic rings when I played dress-up as a kid, but I’ve opted for wearing more understated pieces made from gold or silver since becoming a real adult. That said, it looks like Mejuri is officially making colors cool again with their new selection of enamel pieces, and I’m surprisingly here for it. The collection includes two ring styles and a pair of hoop earrings that come in shades of green, brown and blue. If you’re a true magpie at heart, don’t fret—these enamel pieces are adorned with a single shiny stone in the center for an added blingy bonus.All trends really do end up coming back around. Similar to the pearl jewelry craze that took over my Instagram feed last month and revived the look I once considered stuffy and outdated, enamel is being completely reinvented in 2021. In Mejuri’s collection, the colors are more understated rather than bold or intense, so they’ll play well with your favorite metallic pieces and chunky gold chains. Just like everything else Mejuri sells, these rings are just bold enough to make a statement.Add a few of these rings into your collection for a playful pop of color this season. Read on to see all of the pretty shades.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

10 Summer Camp Jewelry Pieces That Make You Look Craftier Than You Are,"Sure, diamond rings and classic pendant necklace—from lockets to shell-adorned chokers, and everything in between— is definitely jewelry staples that every accessory lover should own at least one of in their personal collection, but if you’re looking to add a bit of either edge of elegance to your look, embellishing your wrist with statement arm candy is your best bet for looking subtle yet adding a little something extra to help refine your overall look.

Your Love of All Things Tropical Can Officially Extend into the Jewelry Sphere,"It’s hardly a stretch to make the argument that last year’s biggest overarching jewelry trend was the Instagram-famous coin necklace, endorsed by countless influencers, style editors and street style stars alike. It makes sense that this classic jewelry style went remarkably viral, as coin necklaces offer the utmost versatility, thanks to their infinitely stackable appeal (the coin and nameplate duo have remained a popular layering combo)—punctuated, of course, by their inherently vintage charm. This spring, though, there’s a new influencer-approved jewelry trend on the block: seashell jewelry.Not only are gilded seashell-shaped designs cropping up as adornments on necklaces, but the resort-ready motif is also a dominant embellishment for rings, statement earrings and hair accessories this season. Even ’90s-era puka shells are coming back to life in modernized jewelry styles that—don’t worry—aren’t exact replicas of the throwback styles beloved by teenage surfers of decades’ past.Before you begin to cringe at this beachy trend’s somewhat startling resurrection, know that today’s puka-imbued jewelry has been revised with polished updates that prevent the designs from looking like an artifact of ’90s ska culture—or some overpriced souvenir purchased at the hotel gift shop during your childhood family vacation. And, if you still need further proof that the unlikely style’s return to fashion is, in fact, a thing, look to none other than Gigi Hadid, who was spotted sporting a puka choker during Paris Fashion Week.Of course, if you can’t even entertain the idea of bringing back the vacation-inspired chokers of your youth, there are plenty of other shell-designed iterations of this under-the-sea trend that feel a bit more refined. Traditional conch shell designs, spiraling shark eyes, and sophisticated sand dollars with opalescent finishes feel more sophisticated (and office-appropriate) than kitsch or novel.And let’s be clear about one thing: last year’s coin necklaces are a timeless, ultra-wearable jewelry piece, so we’re certainly not writing them off as a thing of the past. But if you’ve grown tired of the endlessly ubiquitous coin trend, opt for one of these fresh, under-the-sea (and summer-ready) alternatives, instead.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

These Etsy Valentine's Day Gifts Put Chocolates & Flowers To Shame,"I’ve never had a particularly kitschy fashion sense, but lately, accessorizing with a bit of whimsy just brings me joy—hence why I’m leaning into 2020’s fruit jewelry trend so damn hard. Somewhere between the cottagecore/picnic aesthetic and the classic Girl Next Door exists a perfect blend of the two: The Girl Next Door Who Owns Too Many Plants, Has A Window Sill Garden & Wears Fruit Jewelry. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m happy to announce that I am she. She is me. We are one.But to be clear, I’m not the only one in love with the look. After luxury brands like Mercedes Salazar debuted fun, fruity accessories for summer (I’ve been dreaming about their Tropics Strawberry Earrings for months) and Insta-famous brands like Et Toi Paris littered my Explore Page with cutesy fruitsy jewelry, it seemed the trend was everywhere—and don’t even get me started about the amount of fruit jewelry on Etsy. It’s not to be believed, y’all. Whether or not you think a salad complements your meal, a fruit-themed accessory can and will complement your outfit, so don’t hesitate to try the trend out.Bella Gerard.My personal recommendation for cute statement fruit jewelry that doesn’t look cheesy? I’ve been lovingUK-based brand I’MMANY London‘s Summer Capsule ’20, full of strawberries, grapes and the like. I’MMANY’s collection is about as chic as produce-themed jewelry can get, and the star of the show are undoubtedly their wide array of cherry earrings. You can shop single-drop stems or two-cherry earrings, and choose from a classic red hue to more playful colorways like iridescent lilac, pink and light gray.Bella Gerard.   Double Cherry Drop Earrings$124.60     Buy Now Besides the gold-plated brass brass stems, the coloring on theDouble Cherry Drop Earringslooks so realistic—like, it almost looks as if I went to the grocery store and Michael’s and DIY’d these babies myself. While cherries can sometimes look a little too retro or kitschy, these are actually super classy, and I especially love the idea of pairing them with an all-white outfit, a reddish lip stain and some faux freckles for good measure.Bella Gerard.   Red StrawberryHuggie Hoop Earring$56.64     Buy Now A slightly smaller statement that’s just as sweet is theRed StrawberryHuggie Hoop Earring, sold singular so that you can mix and match with I’MMANY’s other huggie hoops, should you choose to. Fruit jewelry is already as bold as I’ll go, so I played it safe with two red strawberries, but there are also sweet little leaves and berries of all sorts of colors to choose from. My favorite part? That itty-bitty pearl detail at the top, of course.Bella Gerard.If you’re ready to spice up your neutral summer wardrobe with a few statement accessories, the fruit jewelry trend is the move, and I can’t recommend I’MMANY London’s selection enough. Did I mention they also have a Garden Society Collection full of even more produce? Suddenly, I’m in need of a red pepper necklace and a lettuce leaf charm bracelet.

We're Living For All The Statement Necklaces On The Oscars Red Carpet,"There are few celebs I admire more than Hailey Bieber when it comes to off-duty style. I honestly can’t think of a time when I didn’t want to copy something she’s worn—and if her Instagram feed is any indication, it looks like Bieber is ready to serve up inspo for my entire summer wardrobe, especiallymy beach outfits! The model just posted a pic in the most delicate gold body chain and I’m obsessed with her take on styling body jewelry for 2021.ICYMI: It’s May, people! Summer is here and no one is more ready for warm weather than Hailey Bieber. I mean, she’s already showing off her bikini collection on the ‘gram and I’m taking detailed notes! Her most recent post featured a baby pink string bikini from TRIANGL paired with the real star of the show, a glimmering body chain by Jacquie Aiche styled with two coordinating diamond necklaces. She topped off her look with a pair of chunky gold hoop earrings and a few Y2K-inspired mini ponytails around the crown of her head. Yup, copying this look ASAP!         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Hailey Rhode Baldwin Bieber (@haileybieber)If the words “body chain” traumatize you, fear not. These are not the chunky waist chains of the early aughts! Bieber’s version is of a far more delicate nature, which feels much more modern and chic. It also makes the accessory more wearable in my eyes. You can style it like she did over a bikini or wear it under any number of crop tops for some added glitz. Forget other jewelry trends of the season: This summer is all about the beachy body bling.Bieber’s chain was covered in diamonds and costs more than a few thousand bucks, so no, it’s not exactly affordable. But you can still get the look for less! I was able to source a few inexpensive options for you to buy right now if you are trying to copy her blingy bikini vibes.

"Name Jewelry Is Having a Moment, Because Carrie Bradshaw Is a Forever Fashion Icon","When I was a wee elementary schooler, nothing—and I meannothing—made me feel as cool as I did when I wore an anklet. The early-aughts anklets trend empowered me to feel like a beach beauty and badass surfer girl rolled into one. As I lived in middle Tennessee, I was basically never wearing an anklet on or near the beach (or really, anywhere other than Kroger or Target). But I feltcool. I felttransported. I felt like the kind of fashion-forward 8-year-old I knew I was every time I spent hours styling and re-styling my Polly Pocket dolls. 2019’s take on the anklets trend has basically left me feeling the exact same way.These days, my time outdoors is no longer spent near-exclusively at Kroger and Target. And my time spent indoors is no longer spent near-exclusively styling Polly Pocket dolls. (Don’t fret—I’ve been sans Polly Pocket since middle school. You are not reading a fashion story penned by a 25-year-old who still plays with dolls.) I am still in middle Tennessee, so decidedly far from basically any beach—leaving me anything but a beach beauty or badass surfer girl (or some endlessly cool hybrid of the two). I’m an editor who spends her days writing in coffeeshops, working out at the YMCA and—when I’m feeling fancy—eating at Nashville’s trendiest restaurants. None of these settings lend themselves particularly well to anklets, especially now that I’m a 25-year-old with a full-time job andnot an elementary schooler who can basically wear anything she damn well pleases.It’s been challenging, then, for me to wrap my head around the 2019 anklet renaissance. As a fan of basically every retro revival to hit the zeitgeist, I’m predisposed to love it. But as a bona fide adult with a 9-to-5, I’m perplexed as to how—and where—to wear it. Anklets’ beachy connotations leave them feeling ill-fit for the office—let alone any semi-fancy affair, like a party or nice dinner. But I’ve reached a simple conclusion: Anklets are simply too fun to overthink. They’re abundantly on offer in every fast-fashion retailer imaginable, they’re priced competitively, and they’refun. They still make me feel cool and fashion-forward, even if I haven’t figured out their best sartorial application. And they still transport me—just in a slightly different way. Instead of making me feel like my toes are in the sand, they make me feel like my toes are in the fluffy carpet that lined the floors of the house where I grew up—or in a pair of jelly sandals, following my mom’s grocery cart as she darted from aisle to aisle at Kroger.Nostalgia is a beautiful thing.

The Best Mask Straps & Accessories To Make Wearing One Way More Fun,"These ain’t your grandma’s pearls! The pearl jewelry trend blowing up this season is all about adding modern twists to the classic strand. We’re talking statement earrings, mismatched sizes and plenty of stackable rings. After tons of pearls were spotted at the inauguration ceremony this week, I realized just how badly I wanted a strand of my own. The second I typed “pearls” into Google, though, hundreds of options popped up. I should have figured that just about everyone in the world would want some, too.Pearls are often typecast as stuffy, but the look received a revival via TikTok when Gen-Z fashion gurus started showing off their Vivienne Westwood necklaces as the finishing touch to their cool-girl vintage ‘fits. The VW versions retail for hundreds of dollars and are pretty much sold out everywhere at the moment, but there are tons of other trendy brands selling pearls right now to consider. Brands like Mejuri, Missoma and Maison Irem sell alternatives that I can actually afford and totally love, so it looks like I’ll be purchasing more than a few pieces this season.Surprisingly, real pearls on their own aren’t all that expensive, so this use this trend as the perfect excuse to treat yourself without breaking the bank. Whether you opt for a string of real pearls or go for an authentic-looking (and cheaper) imitation version, you’re gonna want to wear these pieces with everything.Keep reading if you’re ready to think of this classic style in a whole new light.

Are Sunglasses Lanyards...Cool Now?,"As someone who was never an avid jewelry wearer growing up (I also attribute this to my horrible taste in fashion — early 2000s kids will know), I’ll be the first to admit that when I heard of using jewelry as an heirloom, I was a bit confused. I mean, why not leave me a house or better yet, a briefcase full of cash? But then I received a present from my mother for Christmas. It was a ring and I was instantly in love — it’s also a much more practical gift than a briefcase of cash. I thought to myself, this is a ring I will wear forever, as it’s simple, classy, and timeless. So timeless in fact that I thought, “this is a staple piece I could hopefully pass down to my future kids.”Passing down jewelry from generation to generation is not a new concept, but it is one that I feel isn’t as prominent as it used to be. Maybe that’s because the jewelry trends have changed so much throughout the years, we wouldn’t be seen wearing something from the early 1900s. Or perhaps, you’re more inclined to wear vintage clothing rather than vintage jewelry (no judgment, here!). Either way, I am 100% prepared to make the case for why jewelry is the way to go when it comes to keeping something in the family. If you’re a skeptic, buckle up because, by the end of this article, I’ll make a jewelry heirloom believer out of you.It helps preserve memoriesOur loved ones unfortunately aren’t going to be around forever. Luckily, we have ways of remembering them, whether it be our memories, old photographs, the names we choose to give (I can attest to this as my middle name is my grandmother’s name), and of course, jewelry. If you consider yourself a fashionista already starting to think about your legacy and how you want future generations to remember you, passing down a timeless infinity bracelet will ensure you’re always known as “the one in the family who had great style.”Pandora.   Pandora Moments Infinity Knot Snake…$85     Buy Now Things always come back in styleLet’s face it — trends always come back in style. Round glasses? Check. Wide-leg pants? Check. Thin eyebrows? Check (unfortunately). My point is if you think those earrings you’re thinking of passing down won’t be in, come 20 years from now, chances are you’re mistaken. Trust me, I’ve seen firsthand how fashion has evolved over time and one thing’s for sure — fashion always makes a comeback. Take the Sparkling Halo Heart Hoop Earrings from Pandora for example. They’re giving me early 1900s Titanic Hope Diamond vibes and I am so here for it.Pandora.   Sparkling Halo Heart Hoop Earrings$115     Buy Now It’s practical andsentimentalJewelry is something we’ll actually wear if passed down (as opposed to a ball gown). Whether you’re going to work, a fancy event, or spending an evening out with friends, accessories are the perfect addition to an outfit. And if you’re wearing (or decide to pass down) a piece of jewelry to or from a family member, that piece will always hold some sentimental value. One practical, yet stylish Pandora jewelry piece is its Sparkling Tennis Bracelet. It makes the perfect gift for any occasion given its history dating back to the 80s, and one that anyone would be thrilled to wear for years.Pandora.   Sparkling Tennis Bracelet$115     Buy Now It’s valuableBecause it’s a family heirloom that is passed down, that means it only needs to be paid for by the initial wearer. It’s no secret that jewelry can get expensive (think thousands of dollars), which is why passing a piece down generations is a thoughtful gesture. The value of a certain accessory can also go up over time so you’ll definitely want to get something that’s worth every penny like Pandora’s gold-plated Sparkling Round Halo Ring.Pandora.   Sparkling Round Halo Ring$115     Buy Now You can make something new from itFun fact: any piece of jewelry can be repurposed or redesigned into a brand new piece. So, if you’re looking to make your grandmother’s old diamond earrings into a ring, or earrings into a necklace, it is possible. If not, there are plenty of jewelers out there who know how to clean and repair old items. Until then, enjoy the staple pieces like these 14k gold-plated stud earrings with clear cubic zirconia while you can until you pass them on for the next person in your family to wear.Pandora.   Sparkling Round Halo Stud Earrings$115     Buy Now It always makes the perfect giftWhether you’re passing down a piece of jewelry for Mother’s Day, a birthday, or just because, accessories are always a great way to show the style icon in your life how much you love them.

Hoop Earrings So Truly Massive You Could Probably Fit Your Head Through Them,"Giving your children piercings and other body modifications is a tricky topic for lots of people—meaning even Kylie Jenner gets mom-shamed for Stormi’s hoop earrings. The Keeping Up With the Kardashiansstar debuted baby Stormi’s latest look on the ‘gram, only to be met with a barrage of criticism over the hoops. Clearly, plenty of these commenters never had their ears pierced as babies (a practice that is commonplace inmanycultures and communities). Or even if they did; some appear to just be trolling the star and her daughter, for hate’s sake.The toddler, who recently celebrated her second birthday with Kylie and dad Travis Scott, didn’t seem bothered. Yet concerned citizens weighed in via Instagram’s comments section, levying cries of abuse and Stormi acting too “grown-up” for these big, bad hoops (which, lest we forget to mention, are even personalized with her name).One user went so far as to suggest that Stormi could face undeserved criticism for looking “ghetto” with these earrings. “lil sis this little baby is cute… however she’s too young for earrings this size…” wrote Instagram user @antoniamoore9229.“From a mother of another black girl…we don’t put earrings on our little girls that size and style because we don’t want people to talk about our kids in negative ways…and calling our children ghetto,” the user added. “she’s an adorable little girl…please save the earrings for her until she’s 12 or 15 years old.” Um.         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Kylie 🤍 (@kyliejenner)We’re going to chalk that one up to a difference in perspectives. What weshouldbe weighing in on is why anyone would term Black jewelry trends as “ghetto” in the first place, whether or not they’re on a baby (this writer from the Bronx wore hoops as young as Stormi, thank you very much).

The Chicest Fall Accessories Trends—and Ways to Shop Them All,"As anyone with an Instagram knows all too well, coin jewelry pervaded the zeitgeist in 2018. Celebrities and “it” girls, alike, adorned their necks with lightweight metal discs meant to look like money—breathing new life into the layered jewelry trend that’s endured for years on end. Though the shell jewelry movement threatened to upend coin jewelry’s reign, it turns out the two aren’t mutually exclusive, after all. Both coin jewelry and shell jewelry are making their way into 2019—offering us a veritable plethora of statement jewelry to choose from.This summer’s coin jewelry trend isn’t the far cry from last year’s you might expect. Coin pendants still abound, leaving minimalists with plenty of ways into the continued trend. But 2019’s coin jewelry movement has seen some maximalist remixes, too. Heavy coin chokers are on offer—so are lengthy chain necklaces, crafted from coin-covered string upon coin-covered string. Now that the aughts have crept into our day-to-day, coin belts are seeing some traction too. As are coin statement earrings—and layered necklaces that capitalize on both the coin jewelry trend and its competitor, the shell jewelry trend, at once.All this is to say: Your favorite retailers have ensured that it’s never too late to hop aboard the coin jewelry bandwagon. If last year’s trend came and went before you had a chance to wrap your sartorial mind around it, you’re in luck, because you still have a whopping season (who knows—maybe even more) to embrace coin jewelry in all its shiny glory.1.

11 Exciting New Ways to Wear Tortoise Shell This Season,"Ah, fall fashion. I couldn’t love it more if I tried! Fall is definitely my favorite season when it comes to styling, as I can combine my favorite aspects of winter (like chic jackets and fun layering) and summer (like showing some skin and playing with color) to create an especially dreamy wardrobe. This season, I really want to go all out, so I’m shopping the top fall fashion trends early to get ahead of the game.What’s in, you ask? The classics. Oversized blazers and slacks will be making a highly anticipated return but this year, they’re joined by cozy striped sweaters and ballet flats (cue gasp). Yes, ballet flats! The shoe we all thought was doomed to being an early 2000’s fashion faux pas has made a triumphant comeback. Hopefully, you’re ready to give them a second turn.Denim is also eager for a reinvention beyond baggy jeans and jackets and is coming in at full force in dress form. I dare you to layer a denim tank dress over a striped sweater (it’ll be amazing).As for accessories, maximalist jewelry is still all the rage. Statement pendants are the coolest way to express yourself this season. Keep reading for the cutest options on the market.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

Just ask Hailey Bieber, who’s always seen in a new pair of parachute pants when she’s off duty or supporting Justin at a show. This trend is a callback to the ’90s and we’re here for it. Especially when it’s paired with a tighter top to balance out the weight of the ensemble. Even better: basically any shoe looks good with these bottoms. Ballet flats, chunky sneakers, boots, trainers you name it.Courtesy of Urban Outfitters.Balloon Cargo PantsGet the look of cargo pants with the comfort of cotton bottoms when you wear these balloon trousers. This pair from Urban Outfitters comes in so many unique colorways that will help you add a pop of color to whatever outfit you’ve got planned. In our opinion, the bolder and brighter you go, the better.   iets frans… Balloon Cargo Pant$75     Buy Now Courtesy of Everlane.The Way-High Drape PantYes, it’s possible to bring the baggy pants trend to the office. Case in point: these checkered bottoms from Everlane. They still give your legs the freedom to move around unrestricted but have a bit more structure to them so that HR would approve.   The Way-High Drape Pant$128     Buy Now Sailor StripesStripes are a pattern that comes in so many widths, colors, and formats that it never goes out of style—unlike cheetah print which runs in just as fast as it runs out. However, there are moments where stripes break out of their preppy affiliation and find their way into every aesthetic. This is one of those moments. Sailor-style stripes in the classic navy and white pairing are about to be hanging over every fashionable set of shoulders this fall. The pattern looks great in a loose-knit weave sweater, long sleeve t-shirt or even on a blazer. Pro tip: always check the men’s selection of sweaters if you love an oversized look.Courtesy of Mango.Striped Knit SweaterIs it a little too early to be wearing a full-on sweater? Yes. Will you be dreaming of this sweater the second temperatures hit 50 degrees? Also, yes. Make the move and get this cuffed sweater in anticipation of cooler days ahead. This chocolate version is available in sizes XXS-4X.   Striped Knit Sweater $59.99     Buy Now Courtesy of Cos.Knitted Half Zip SweaterIf you were obsessed with the summer edition of the coastal grandmother esthetic, then you need a half-zip to keep the fun going through the fall. The style is the perfect combination of sporty and preppy—and looks much cuter than wearing a sweatshirt.   Knitted Half Zip Sweater$135     Buy Now Ballet FlatsBallet flats have been trying to make a comeback for a few seasons but I’m here to report that it’s finally show time. Now before you decide this trend isn’t for you, I beg you to take a deep breath and let go of the grudge you have against ballet flats. I promise that nobody is asking you to wear them with skinny jeans or a skater skirt. Instead, picture yourself wearing them with linen slacks, chic midi skirts, vintage denim and even a low-rise mini skirt. Cool right? I’m so excited to embrace this trend and become the shining star of Balletcore.Courtesy of Zara.Bow Trim Leather Ballet FlatsLeave it to Zara to have the coolest (and most affordable) version of the trend. This pair of metallic ballet flats are a great maximalist take on the trend. They also come in pink and black.

All the Spring Flats We're Eyeing Right Now,"I spent a decade of my life at summer camp. Yes, that means ten whole summers spent sitting in a cabin in New Hampshire! So, you can imagine how happy I was when I saw colorful, beaded summer camp-inspired jewelry begin popping up on TikTok and Instagram. I felt like childhood me had pioneered the look! If you’re not a camp gal, though, I have some good news—you can still buy these bracelets and necklaces and look every bit the arts-and-crafts superstar with none of the effort (and none of the glue on your hands).This bold, beaded jewelry trend is just the next phase in the colorful wardrobe makeover that’s been slowly occurring as we enter into the summer months. Still, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen bright accessories go big online—camp necklaces follow the rise of Gen Z-approved enamel earrings and chunky, kitschy bubble rings.When styled with those playful pieces, these campy picks actually seem a little more understated. But that doesn’t mean these aren’t just as fun! Whether you gravitate towards a more delicate option or pick up a necklace covered in smiley faces and glittery hearts, there’s no wrong way to do it up.Summer 2021 is truly the season of maximalism, from the clothes we wear to the bags and jewelry we accessorize with.

Urban Outfitters' Summer 2019 Collection Is Exactly as Cute as You'd Expect,"Anyone who knows me well will not be surprised to hear that tropical jewelry sits at the intersection of everything I love about fashion. The tropical print revival has long been one of my favorite trends, as its roots in “ugly” fashion run deep. Call me ascetic, but few things sound more fun than digging up some fascinating, by-all-contemporary-definitions ugly piece of clothing and rendering it trendy, chic, covetable. Nothing—not even a shirt embraced only by frat bros and dads on vacation—can trump creative styling. Tropical prints are fun, and unexpected, and challenging. And statement jewelry is delightfully campy no matter what form it’s taking. 2019’s tropical jewelry trend, then, is a marriage of two lovely, lovely things.Summer 2019 has, by all measures, really only just begun—but it’s already seen an array of statement jewelry trends enter the zeitgeist. Fruit jewelry has shown us our taste buds and our taste in clothing have more in common than we’d think. Last year’s shell jewelry trend is back and perhaps even more eye-catching than ever. And the somewhat recent friendship bracelet trend has reminded us all of the importance of wearing our hearts on our sleeves (or really, on our wrists). Tropical jewelry is joining a vast and varied cast of statement-making players—all of which are sitting idly by on digital shelves, just waiting to add a healthy dose of personality (and a trendy dose of camp) to your accessories arsenal.Though some of this season’s other jewelry trends are limited in terms of form (friendshipbracelets, for instance), tropical jewelry spans genres. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a necklace person, or an earrings person, or awhatever person—you’re sure to find a trendy piece that’ll work for you (though it bears mentioning that tropical earrings are particularly abundant). So what are you waiting for? I’m serving you a veritable plethora of ways to keep your love of the tropics close to heart and mind at all times—all you have to do is scroll down.1.

"Opal Jewelry to Shop, Because Iridescent Is the New Black","And the award goes to…the STATEMENT NECKLACE! If you didn’t have time to watch the Oscars red carpet, I hate to break it to you, but you missed a lot of great looks. To bring you up to speed, allow me to present the number one Oscars 2020 jewelry trend: Necklaces.The abundance of statement necklaces on the carpet positively blew me away, and it seemed like everyone from Janelle Monae to Florence Pugh had a neck drenched in diamonds. Even though these celebs wowed in dresses that were eye-catching all on their own, many chose to couple them with chunky necklaces that were just as impressive, and it’s an accessory trick I’ll most definitely be copying for my next night-out look.Check out the biggest and blingiest necklaces of the night below, as well as a few glitzy options for trying out the look yourself.Photo: ShutterstockJanelle MonaeJanelle Monae’s spectacular hooded gown is the kind of dress that needs no accessorizing, and yet she took things one step further with a blinged-out choker to match her sparkling ensemble.Photo: ShutterstockMindy KalingMindy Kaling’s necklace isn’t just gorgeous— it’s ex$pensive. During her red carpet interview, Kaling told Ryan Seacrest that she had to have a bodyguard accompany her all night just to make sure it was safe! The Zaxie To the Moon and Back CZ Tennis Necklace gives off the same dripping-in-diamonds vibes, but at just under $100, it’s likely quite a bit more affordable than Kaling’s priceless piece.Photo: ZaxieZaxie CZ Tennis Necklace$95Buy NowPhoto: ShutterstockZazie BeetzZazie Beets wins my vote for Best Statement Necklace of the night. This thing is major, people! The diamond and emerald masterpiece truly belongs in a museum.Photo: David Fisher/ShutterstockGreta GerwigGreta Gerwig joined Zazie in rocking an emerald-and-diamond look, and the gorgeous green gems really made her eyes pop.

So good!Photo: ShutterstockLily SinghLily Singh scrapped the diamond approach worn by so many other celebs and instead layered two pearl necklaces with a chunky golden chain.

101 Festival-Ready Pieces Worth Shopping Right Now,"Surely it would surprise no one to hear me call name tags a necessary evil. No onewants to adorn themselves with a glorified human label—an adhesive one that ruins their outfit, no less.But. One of 2019’s most visible sartorial movements—the name jewelry trend—has called this logic into question. Maybe we don’t mind wearing glorified human labels. Maybe we enjoy adorning ourselves with our names. Maybe welike accessories that do the talking—or at least, the introducing—for us.In its first iteration, the name jewelry trend was perhaps most iconically sported by two abject style goddesses: Carrie Bradshaw (of fictionalSex and the City fame) and Princess Diana. Diana was spotted, on many occasions, sporting a short necklace emblazoned with the letter D. And asSATC fans know well, Carrie wore a “Carrie” necklace throughout the show’s tenure. (The necklace even became a central plot point in one episode.) This trend, as all trends are wont to do, trickled out of the zeitgeist. And then it trickled back in. Name jewelry is now available in basically every jewelry format—earrings, chokers, bracelets, hair accessories—and basically every name format, too (which is really just to say, you can go to Diana initial route, or the Carrie full-name route).And those who find themselves a bit put off by the whole wearing their name 24/7 thing can rest assured knowing a sub-iteration of the trend has re-emerged, alongside the name jewelry one.Word jewelry—accessories inscribed with various words (notnecessarily names)—is as abundantly on offer as name jewelry is. You can sport your favorite curse word. Or announce how #blessed you are to the world. You can don jewelry that renders you a self-proclaimed queen. Hell, you can even wear Marc Jacob’s name in hoop earring form, if that were ever a thing you’d dreamt of.So crack open a dictionary and remind yourself of all your favorite words. Odds are, they’re currently available in accessory form, just waiting to be sported by the likes of you.[sc-button price=”85″ url=”https://www.shopbop.com/logo-hoop-marc-jacobs/vp/v=1/1513051330.htm” title=”Marc Jacobs The Logo Hoops”]We weren’t kidding when we said the Marc Jacobs thing.

But these beauts aren’t your grandma’s glasses chain. Both chunkyand dainty chains and straps have had a major comeback (They look really cute on sunglasses, FYI!), and the trend has transitioned seamlessly to work with all your favorite face masks. Typically, you just clip the accessories onto your mask and go!

You can also go with a classic gold link mask chain, too—especially if you’re really into 2020’s jewelry trends. And if chains aren’t your thing, there are headbands and hair clips to help you keep your mask looking cute AF as well!

"Yes, Matching Jewelry Is the Accessory of the Season - Here's Who You Can Get Them For","Each year brings with it several trendy retro revivals—most cyclical, most expected. Trends come and go, and then come back again; such is the way the sartorial world works, and we’re typically excited to see old favorites making a comeback. But every so often, a vintage trend creeps into the zeitgeist and sees a resurgence none of us could have possibly predicted. Such was the case with dad sneakers, tropical prints and the enduring bike short. And now, sunglasses chains (known by many as sunglasses lanyards) are seeing a similar treatment.Earlier this month, a Free People representative told StyleCaster that sunglasses lanyards—chains that attach to the sides of your sunglasses and drape behind your head, like a backwards necklace—were poised to be big come summer 2019. And the summer accessories that retailers have on offer have only backed up this assertion. Nasty Gal, Urban Outfitters and Free People are littered with chains meant to adorn your sunglasses (or even your regular glasses), because in the age of maximalism, everything deserves a little accessorizing.We get it—this is oneseriously strange trend. Eyeglass chains feel classically vintage, whereas lanyards reek of frat bro origins. This is one odd couple that never deserved a meet-cute. Yet they got one, and when the result of this union is as sophisticated-yet-unabashedly-fun as sunglasses chains are, it’s kind of hard to be mad, no?1. Icon Sunglasses Chain, $18 at Urban OutfittersNot quite starry-eyed—more starry-eyed-adjacent.2. Bead It Glasses Chain, $5 at Nasty GalFodder for kindergarten dress-up dreams.3.

Feminist Jewelry Makes a Statement in More Ways Than One,"Jewelry trends are among the strangest around. In 2018, we thought it advisable to hang faces from our ears. So far in 2019, we’ve grown attached to adorning ourselves with glorified nametags, sporting fruit-shaped baubles of all kinds and extending our tropical print obsession into the accessory sphere. We’ve also taken our mild obsession with hoop earrings to a new level; the hoop earrings trend has become the big hoop earrings trend, which has since become thetruly massive hoop earrings trend. A huge hoop is simply not an adequately huge hoop unless it’s huge enough to stick your entire head through.Our initial resurrection of the hoop earrings trend was a nod to the early aughts, when hoop earrings were as abundant as low-rise jeans, butterfly clips and chainmail. Metallic textiles and shiny embellishments abounded, accentuated by the circular metal hoops we hung from our ears. Though we’ve revived a great many 2000s-inspired sartorial movements, hoops have pervaded the zeitgeist unlike any other (perhaps because they’re a bit more approachable than, say, that iconic sparkly cowl mini that hardly covered Paris Hilton’s body at all). But, as we and our camp-loving hearts are wont to do, we’ve taken hoop earrings to their most voluminous extreme. We’ve demanded that they not only be circles, but that they be enormous circles—gargantuan circles. If a hoop earring isn’t big enough to graze our shoulders—or more dramatically, our collarbones—is it even a hoop earring at all?!We’d be remiss not to admit that wearing truly massive hoop earrings is a power move in its own right. And surely, being able to shove your head through your earring is a pretty impressive party trick. But all we really want to know is: Where will it end? Will we not be satisfied until hoops have become so colossal that we can fit our entire selves through them? That we can hula hoop with them? That we can loop them ’round our houses—nay, our yards? Will hoop earrings continue growing and growing until they envelop our earth?Only time will tell. For now, there is shopping to be done—and there are huge hoop earrings to be had.

Party Pants Are Here To Add Some Flare To Your Summer Wardrobe,"Growing up, pearl jewelry epitomized one thing and one thing only: classic glamour. Pearl pieces were to be paired exclusively with ball gowns and fancy gloves, making them a favorite of mine any time I went to play dress-up. As time went on, though, pearl jewelry was remixed, and then remixed again. It no longer felt exclusively reserved for the upper echelons of society; new iterations left the jewelry trend accessible to any aesthetic. And these days, pearl pieces are almost as commonplace as rhinestones were during the early aughts.Now that we’ve lifted the veil of exclusivity that once barred pearl jewelry from the masses, out-of-the-box pearl pieces have made their way into fast-fashion retailers. Pearl-covered barrettes are on the sartorial menu. So are pearl-lined chokers and pearl-dotted bobby pins. Pearl-covered hoops have offered jewelry designers a way to capitalize on two earring trends at once; the hoop-drop hybrid feels endlessly edgy, no matter how many times it’s done.The best thing about pearl jewelry isn’t its classic appeal or its aesthetic versatility—but the fact that it’s never a bad buy. No one will ever reminisce on the pearl jewelry they’ve purchased with buyer’s remorse or trend-follower’s regret. Pearl pieces are nevernot chic, no matter how out-of-the-box they are. Pearl jewelry is a no-fail purchase, and given the immense variety of unique pearl jewelry on the market right now, there’s never been a better time to stock up.1.

Where to Find Affordable Alternatives to Cult Designer Jewelry,"Tortoise shell is a classic pattern marked by its multifaceted neutral coloration and patch-worked array of various tones of brown and taupe. We’re used to seeing tortoise motifs in eyewear and well, cats, but this season, we’re making the case for extending the timeless decorative design beyond its prevailing appearance in eyewear and into new territories. It’s official: Tortoise shell accessories are here, and they’re more varied than ever before.Versatile yet distinctive, tortoise designs have long offered a skin tone-flattering colorway—one that’s become a staple in our go-to cat-eye sunnies and our favorite pairs of prescription frames (you know, the ones that magically upgrade any 9-to-5 office ensemble or lazy Sunday library look). But why not bring the universally-flattering and timelessly classic tortoise shell pattern into your other accessories, as well?Tortoise shell has been making its way into jewelry—and even hair accessories as of late—and we’re more than happy to embrace the trend. And if you’re looking for a larger-scale way to join the tortoise shell accessories movement,you’re in luck because pattern is currently popping up in footwear and handbags as well.Consider tortoise shell a neutral—but an exciting, maximalist one.

15 Statement Earrings That Look Good With a Cocktail Dress—and Even Better With Jeans,"Something about spring just makes us want to shoe-shop. (Maybe the fact that we’ve been wearing the same damn pair of snow boots every day since October?? Maybe??) Now that we’re shedding layers, trading sweaters for T-shirts and whipping out our favorite relaxed jeans on the reg, we’re in dire need of footwear that feels as fresh as our spring wardrobes. That means spring heels, spring wedges and spring flats in every possible shape, texture and color. Budgets, beware—we’re coming for these shoe stores, and we’re coming for them hard.We’d be lying if we said spring flats were the first thing we thought to stock up on this season. Once we handled our sundress and swimsuit situation, we moved into top-of-mind accessory domains—namely, spring heels and wedges. Heels feel party-worthy and wedges feel vacation-worthy. In other words, they’refun, and once winter starts to wear off, we can’t bear the thought of practicality any longer. But. Once it gets hot out, no one has the energy to run around in heels and wedges all day—at least, we don’t. So when we’re getting dressed in the morning, we never find ourselves reaching for the spring heels and wedges we just bought. Those are occasion pieces, not everyday ones—and that’s exactly why spring flats are so vital.Flats get kind of a bad rap. Like we said, flats tend to get lumped in with other practical necessities—leaving them feeling kind of, well, un-fun. But the current selection of spring flats is anything but. Seriously, some of the mules, sandals and loafers on offer at your favorite retailers right now are seriously cute—cuter than some of the spring heels we’ve seen this season, and definitely cute enough to warrant a spot in your fun rotation. If you’ll let them, spring flats will elevate even the laziest of spring ensembles, and they’ll keep you comfortable while they’re at it. That’s a sartorial win/win if we’ve ever seen one. So give spring flats a chance (and a quick perusal), won’t you?1. All Black Colorblocked Slides, $149 at AnthropologieThe easiest way to dress up a tee-and-jeans combo? Slip into these.2. Fabric Moroccan Barbouches, $49.90 at ZaraWho needs beach sandals when you can wear these woven flats, instead?3.

"Anthropologie’s Sale Section Is An Extra 50% Off RN, And We’re Adding Everything To Cart","Statement earrings are always a good idea. But spring statement earrings are an even better one.

Warmth, the weekend and cute AF statement jewelry is a trifecta that truly cannot be beat.Naturally, shopping spring statement earrings has become one of our favorite pastimes in recent months. The moment the spring equinox came and went, we traded our go-to black Chelsea boots for fresh white sneakers, we swapped our sleekest black skinnies for relaxed mom jeans, and we dropped our sophisticated silver hoops to make room for, well, every pair of spring statement earrings we laid eyes on. During winter, minimalism reigns, so accessories are pretty easy to manage. But during spring and summer, maximalism comes out to play, leaving the statement jewelry landscape vaster and more varied than ever.Color is on the menu. So are kitschy shapes. So is every combination of beads and pearls and rhinestones you can possibly imagine. It’s not enough to render hoops in glitter-infused resin—you have to cover them in beads that boast paint strokes in every shade of the rainbow. Dream up a truly strange pair of spring statement earrings, and get ready to whip out your credit card—because they probably already exist. Whether you’re a fan of drop, hoop, stud or evenclip-on styles, there’s at least one pair of spring statement earrings designed with you in mind. Honestly, there are probably a few.So drop those dainty hoops and shelve your favorite studs for a while.

Meet the Designer Taking 'Personalized' Jewelry to the Next Level,"Humans will never be mermaids. Or fairies. Or unicorn queens. Or the myriad other fantastic creatures that inspire our aesthetics, our Halloween costumes, our dreams. But the enduring iridescence trend has allowed us to get closer to a reality in which we are these dreamy, wonderful things; if we wear enough opal jewelry and drape our homes with enough holographic textiles, maybe—even if just for a moment—we can live out the fantasies that inhabit our imaginations.Dreams of modern-day fairytales aside, it’s impossible to look upon our modern-day love of all things iridescent with anything but absolute mesmerization. Mostly because, well, the trend is pretty damn mesmerizing. There’s something endlessly beautiful about the blend of purples, aquas and millennial pinks—the way iridescence reflects and captures light simultaneously, the depth of color that changes oh-so subtly every time you move your eyes. It’s hardnot to access the most imaginative portals of your mind every time you lay eyes on an iridescent bauble. Everything from holographic shower curtains to iridescent water bottles captivates the brain—with genuinely precious pieces, like opal jewelry, feeling the most bewitching at all.My aesthetic doesn’t lend itself well to iridescence. I’m a bright colors, bold prints, tactile-y grounded maximalist; iridescence’s airy beauty only gets lost when thrown into my heavy atmosphere. But even I can’t resists its charms. I’m as apt as anyone else to spend hours perusing shiny things—combing through the internet’s selection of truly stunning opal jewelry—simply because it’s a beautiful way to pass the time. So whether or not you’re on the market for a new iridescent ring, take a moment and lose yourself in a veritable sea of stunning opal jewelry. The practice is somewhat meditative—and at the very least, it’s fun.1.

5 Jewelry Trends For This Season You Won't Want to Miss,"I’m not one to say “I told you so,” but when I brought BONBONWHIMS to StyleCaster readers’ attention back in April, I knew it was the next big jewelry It Brand. Major fashionistas and celeb tastemakers like Kylie Jenner and Sofia Richie were already wearing the brand’s creative, colorful pieces—and slowly but surely, it’s amassed even more majorly famous fans. As I watched and re-watched the new music video for “Brutal,” I couldn’t help but notice Olivia Rodrigo’s jewelry in one particular scene.The “Brutal” video is, among other things, fantastic. In my opinion, it’s one of the best returns to music video-ing at its core that we’ve seen in a hot minute. And just as good as the concept and storytelling, of course, are the outfits. With portions of her face covered by virtual masks reminiscent of Instagram and Snapchat face filters, Rodrigo let her attire and accessories do the talking for the bulk of the video. That said, there was one piece in particular that stood out.In the classroom scene, Rodrigo paired a punky plaid skirt and a red tank that says “Flirt” with a red beret and braided pigtails. Finishing off the look, she rocked some silver oversized soda tab-style earrings by Pattaraphanand a rectangular, glittery red ring with a black gummy bear on top. That ring, of course, was classic BONBONWHIMS.Like it? Boy oh boy, do I have great news for you: You can snag one for yourself! BONBONWHIMS founder Clare Ngai isn’t one to send celebs exclusive pieces and leave their fans wanting something similar—she always makes sure they can get their hands on the real thing. In the past, fans went positively wild for a clear bubble ring worn by Ariana Grande, so I have no doubt that the aptly-named Brutal Ring will be the brand’s next big seller.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do. Please note that if you purchase something by clicking on a link within this story, we may receive a small commission of the sale.Courtesy of BONBONWHIMS.   Brutal Ring$65     Buy Now TBH, even if I wasn’t a fan of Rodrigo I’d want this ring. Gummy bear jewelry has been trending all summer, but I’ve been worried that the Rainbow Brite color scheme so many brands are pushing would wear itself out by fall. A classic emo-chic color combo like black and red never gets old! I love the thought of rocking this with an otherwise understated monochrome black look as a pop of something fun and quirky. Or, you know, as part of my inevitable Olivia Rodrigo Halloween costume.Her BONBONWHIMS ring isn’t the only fun accessory Rodrigo wears in the video; she also rocks some seriously cute (And affordable! Under $50!) chunky gold hoops with flower detailing by Notte, not to mention a bevy of early aughts-inspired hair clips in the final scene. Unrelated, but I’d go as far as to say that Rodrigo is bringing pigtails back. And strangely, I’m here for it?Courtesy of Geffen Records.Bottom line, Rodrigo positively smashed her latest video. I’m thrilled that “Brutal” is her new single! It’s destined to have as much success as “Driver’s License” or “good 4 u,” just as I’m destined to copy her fashion choices and buy myself this gummy bear ring. Someone warn my credit card—it’s brutal out here! "
Bangles & Big Hoops Are Bringing The '80s Back To Jewelry Trends,"Any solid festival wardrobe involves a combination of a few things: comfy clothes you can move around in all day (and night) long, pieces that are lightweight enough for midday humidity and cozy enough for breezy nights, and chic AF style. This last bit is, of course, the most fun part of this endeavor—and it’s the thing that leaves the festival clothes landscape feeling as delightful, exciting and Instagram-worthy as it does. It’s also the thing that makes me want to shop festival clothes, even though I’m not planning on attending a single festival this year.When I went to Bonnaroo some many years ago, my priority was fashion—not function. I spent my days in delightfully bohemian crop tops and short shorts that made my butt look excellent—until they rode up so significantly they basically served as a second pair of underwear. The versatile gladiators I relied on to tie my outfits together split apart halfway through the fest, leaving me in something of a footwear rut. (But hey—Bonnaroo’s an alternately dusty or muddy experience, and I simply wasn’t prepared to sacrifice any of my clean AF sneakers to the festival gods.) I wore rainbow snapbacks, adorned my hair with flower crowns and layered on Free People jewelry. My looks were photogenic as hell—but my head got seriously hot and sweaty, and I’m just not the kind of person who can stand to bounce around in beaded shit all day. By the end of the four days, I was basically relying on sports bras, tie-dye tanks and Nike shorts—a far cry from the fashion-forward looks I’d mentally assembled, but a much more practical option that kept me from getting distracted by my clothing every 19 seconds.I’ve been to a handful of festivals since then, and it’s become clear to me that the dichotomy between fashion and function is a false one—at least as far as festival clothes are concerned. The festival clothing selection is incredibly vast, and it’s full of pieces that are as practical as they are pretty (or weird, or statement-making, or breezy, or whatever other aesthetic you’re currently cultivating). Comfort and chic style are far from mutually exclusive; it’s entirely possible to craft a festival wardrobe fully of comfy clothes, and lightweight-yet-cozy necessities and head-turning looks. It’s, in fact, so possible (and so damn fun) that I’ve found myself planning festival outfits I won’t be able to wear any time soon—leaving you, dear reader, with a comprehensive guide to all the festival clothes worth shopping right now.1.

5 Summer Jewelry Trends That Work From The Beach To Happy Hour,"Our political climate is, perhaps, at one of its most regressive moments in decades. But our social climate isn’t. From the initial Women’s March to the Me Too movement, feminism looms large—with many women feeling more emboldened than ever to fight on behalf of financial parity, equitable treatment and gender equality in every possible form. This feminism manifests in myriad different ways, with each woman paving her own path in the sociopolitical sphere. But it should come as no surprise that this massive cultural movement has trickled into the realms of art and fashion, giving rise to sartorial trends, like feminist jewelry, that mimic our social movements.Our graphic tees have become more defiant, emblazoned with slogans that demand more than they concede. Our hats have become, quite literally, more vulvovaginal, standing in as symbols of our strength, our pride, our womanhood (albeit one specific—and white—form of womanhood). And even our daintiest accessories—our jewelry—have undergone something of a feminist transformation. Adorned with frank, celebratory images of the female form or even franker political slogans, our necklaces, bracelets, earrings and rings have become outlets for our voices—empowering us to express ourselves in ways as subtle as they are statement-making.We’d be ignoring the metaphorical elephant in the room if we failed to address one simple truth: Fashion may feel like a commodified and frivolous approach to the feminist movement. Capitalism is a complicated thing—one that has entrenched many women, especially women of color, in poverty. And buying a political T-shirt is no substitute for getting involved in local politics, supporting feminist candidates or turning out to vote. However, we’re of the mind that the world is better with more pro-women stuff in it. And if a woman wants to nod to her politics while getting dressed in the morning, who are we to tell her she shouldn’t?

"Five 2021 Jewelry Trends To Invest In, From Pendants To Pearls","Summer 2021 is all about overdressing, from accessorizing with over-the-top jewelry to styling fun-as-hell party pants on a regular basis. Yes, you read that correctly: I said Party Pants. They’re here in a big way to shake up your wardrobe this season—and I am 100 percent down to have some fun.It feels like the entire Internet is sick of wearing the same thing over and over.After a year spent mostly in our pajamas and comfy (albeit cute) matching loungewear sets, it makes sense that everyone would collectively be looking forward to trying something a little different. Maybe that’s the reason why over-the-top pieces like summer camp-inspired jewelry and party pants are trending these days. Consider these statement-making bottoms the maximalist version of those flared leggings that were trending on TikTok a few months ago. This season’s updated offerings come in way more colors and prints than just your basic black, though, from floral-patterned mesh to retro swirls to marble and so much more. No print is too bold and no color too bright when it comes to the humble party pant!What else makes a pair of pants party-ready, exactly? There are a few key signifiers for you to be aware of on your search. Oftentimes, party pants feature a high-waisted fit and a flared leg. Now, the extent of that flare is up to you—pick an option that’s a little more fitted for a relaxed vibe, or go all-out with a wider flare to make more of a splash. Of course, cutouts are always welcome to amp things up in addition to the aforementioned fun colors and prints.Regardless of how many versions there are, all party pants have one thing in common: They’re seriously cute.

13 Ways To Start Wearing Spring's Enamel Jewelry Trend Right Now,"Let’s get one thing clear: When we say fashion mistakes, we’re not talking about wearing an outfit that could land you on a worst-dressed list, if people were judging. Rather, we’re talking about long-held habits you refuse to break, fashion clichés you still believe are true, and small things you’re avoiding—or doing—that can wreak havoc on your personal style.From not getting things tailored enough (bad!), to buying into the idea that you have to throw certain things away before you turn 30 years old (stupid!), here are 40 fashion mistakes you should start remedying right now.Photo: Gotham/Getty ImagesYou BelieveWhite Shouldn’t Be Worn After Labor DayLadies, listen up: This is an antiquated rule that shouldn’t be followed.As countless designers and fashion stars have proven during the past fewseasons, white is not only appropriatewhen the weather turnschilly, but it’s also amazingly fresh and modern. One thing to keep in mind when tackling the white-in-winter trend: It’s all about the fabric. Lighter textiles such as white cotton, linen, canvas, and seersucker will look out of place during fall and winter, so be sure you’re reaching for white wool, cashmere, fur, mohair, flannel, silk, and leather.You Always Buy the Same Size in ClothesAs any woman who’s shopped high-fashion and fast-fashion knows, sizing can vary tremendously according to store, brand, and item. Cheaper clothing typically runs way bigger, making it common for a woman to wear, say, a size Large at Forever 21, but still be a size 2 in Stella McCartney. Don’t sweat the number—pay attention to how things look on your body instead.You Wear Retro Pieces Without a Modern SpinWe all know that fashion is cyclical and thateverythingcomes back around, but that doesn’t mean you shoulddress in full of-another-decade outfits, whichcould run the risk of making you look like you’re both in costume and 10 years older.Love the look of a wild, ’80s neon sweater you found at the Salvation Army? Leave the leggings and sneakers at home, and opt for a pair of super-sleek skinny jeans, natural hair and makeup, and a great pair of ankle boots. Found a vintage swingy midi-skirt? Style it with modern staples like a cropped leather jacket and a sleek pair of pointy heels, as opposed to wearing a pussy-bow blouse and pearls.MORE:How to Nail the Dad Sneaker Trend: A Shopping and StylingGuideYou Think ‘Dry Clean Only’ Tags Are Always CorrectIf a garment says it needs to be dry-cleaned, it won’t hurt to follow suit, but that can get pricey—especiallysince some items technically don’t need to beprofessionallycleaned. Many high-end brands that manufacture items in washable fabrics will often say “dry clean only” to keep up the higher-end vibe. Furthermore, certain fabrics, such as cashmere, actually hold up better when they’re washed by hand as opposed to getting dry-cleaned. Here’s a good guide to help you figure out what doesn’t really have to be cleaned by a pro.YouBelieveTall Women Shouldn’t Wear HeelsThis mandate isn’t only silly, but a little sexist, too. Stemming from a whole bunch of antiquated notions—including abundant height isn’t feminine, and a woman shouldn’t draw extra attention to herself—this rule is one no woman should ever follow if she doesn’t want to. We know plenty of women who are six feet tall and still rock killer heels with grace (ahem, Jenna Lyons, Charlize Theron,Michelle Obama, Karlie Kloss….)You Shop for InstagramWe hate to assume you’d buy anything simply so people know you own it, butsuchis the world in which we live. Are you buying thatBalenciagabag because you really, really love it, or because you want others to know you boughtit?If you buy those Jimmy Choopumps, will you be able to truly enjoy them without posting themto social media?If the answer is no, you might have some thinking to do about your shopping habits.MORE:100 Best Beauty Tips and Tricks You’ve GottaTryPhoto: Christian Vierig/Getty ImagesYou Avoid HorizontalStripes like the PlagueBuying into the notionthat all horizontallines make you look wide is a cliché mistake. Yes, we’ll admit that a skin-tight bodycon dress emblazoned with horizontal lines might only look good on a model, but pieces that are made well and fit well—think a classic cotton Breton striped shirt tucked into dark jeans, a ladylike full-skirt with horizontal stripes, or a great striped overcoat—flatters every woman.You Think You Can Only Wear One Bold Color at a TimeIf we’ve learned anything from the recent color-blocking phenom, it’s that a bold, saturated hue can look even better when paired with another bold, saturated hue. Wearing an emerald-green silk blouse? Don’t be afraid to wear those fuchsia suede heels or carry that sunny yellow leather clutch—you’ll look super-modern.MORE:51 Fashion-Forward Pinterest Accounts to Follow for Major StyleInspoYou Hate Shopping, so You Rely on the Same Old Dinosaurs in Your ClosetNot that into fashion or shopping? That’s fine, but you are probably into looking presentable, so it’s not the end of the world to replace those 15-year-old, square-toe brownloaferswith an updatedstyle, or replace your boot-cut black pants from the late ’90s with a pair that fits well and has a slimmer line. Go ahead and stick to the same styles, but just give them small updates. You’ll not only appear more youthful, but you’ll probably find you enjoy getting dressed a little more when you have modern pieces that fit.You Think Actual Menswear Is Just for MenObviously, you’re not going to pick up a suit at Rochester Big and Tall, but you’d be surprised by how many made-for-men pieces can work for you. This is especially true at common outposts like Forever 21, H&M, J. Crew, and Zara, whose men’s stuff—think slim-cut button-downs, sweatshirts, oversized sweaters, and utility jackets—often aren’t as trendy as their for-women counterparts, and offer a slightly slouchierfit.You Think Sweatshirts Are Strictly Casual WearOnce strictly for athletes, gym-goers, and errand-runners, the humblesweatshirthas risen to become a very stylish staple. Need proof? Top designers like Kenzo, Phillip Lim, Cynthia Rowley, and Karen Walker have been showcasing versions that are embellished and printed, while street-style stars started pairing their sweatshirts with swingy skirts, skinny trousers, and statement necklaces. And we’re not only taking about designer versions, either—your old heather-gray Hanes sweatshirt will do the trick nicely.Photo: Melodie Jeng/Getty ImagesYou Think Mixed Prints Are Way Too BusyActually, mixed prints can lookextremelyfresh, and elevate your look from ordinary to street-style ready in no time. Style pros know that anything goes when it comes to melding motifs (florals with stripes! polka dots with Ikat!), but beginners should start with this tip: Treating leopard or camo (or both) like neutrals is the easiest way to break into pattern mixing. Whatever colored print you choose, add a leopard or camo belt, shoe, bag, blouse, oranythingelse.You Think Mixing Gold and Silver is a Faux PasNot only is this idearidiculous, but it also causes you to miss out on some killer jewelry trends, like mixed-metal midi rings, delicate layered necklaces, or a seriously diverse #armparty.MORE:15 Insider Tips on How to Layer Jewelry Like aProYou Think You Can’t Wear Red to a WeddingThis somewhat ridiculous fashion rule was put intoplaceduring more conservative times when red was thought to be a way-too-sexy, attention-stealing color. Yes, you might want to stay away from wearing a skin-tight, red plunging spandex gown to a wedding, but you probably don’t want to wear that in any color. These days, there are tons of high-style red dresses that are perfectly acceptable as formal wear, as evidenced by the runways at fashion week and red carpets, on which celebrities often wear red gowns that look elegant and classic, as opposed to tawdry.A good rule of thumb: Choose red gowns with clean lines that are made from chiffon, silk, or organza, as opposed to shiny satin or anything too stretchy, and always keep embellishments to a minimum.You Get Caught up in One-Season WondersLet’s be clear: We certainly don’tthink every splurge needs to be something “classic” that’ll last until the end of time(where’s the fun in that?), but wedothink dropping a ton on something that’s so obviously the “it” item from one collection is silly.Why? Because there’s an excellent chancethat, after the season is up and the luster starts to fade, you might start to feel that your splurge was partially due to the immediacy of having something coveted, rather than having something you’ll adore long-term.You Think ‘Classics’ Have to Cost a Ton of MoneyMost women can’t—or prefer not to—drop a ton of cash on clothes every season, even onstaples we’re told will always be in style. That’s why off-price retailers such as TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Century 21 are so great for scoring realdesignerpiecesat a fraction of the cost. Even several fast-fashion stores like Zara, ASOS, and Uniqlo are upping theirgame and quality,offeringanarrayof timeless piecessuch aswool overcoats, leather Chelsea boots, wool and cashmere sweaters, and silk blouses at seriously wallet-friendly prices.You Think Faux Diamonds Are a Faux PasWhile fake designer bags are a hugedon’t, fake diamond studs in a reasonable size are a hugedo. Why? Because faux stones are hard to spot to the untrained eye.You Believe Loose Styles Flatter Plus-Size Women MostIt’s a myth that loose, flowy styles flatter a large bust or a plus-size woman. The area just under the bust is a woman’s smallest torso measurement, so emphasizing it with a structured waistband that hits higher than your natural waist will make you look a size smaller.MORE:13 Genius Curvy-Women Styling Tips We Can Learn from AshleyGrahamYou Think Jeans Should Be Washed as Much as Your Other ClothingDenim aficionados know that raw denim can take up to six months to break in and shouldn’t be washed until then.Why? Jeans really do conform to our bodies, and when you wash them, most of the shape is lost.Most jeans today, however, are treated (pre-washed to achieve a faded look) and don’t need to be broken in. These you can wash more often, butonlywhen they’re stained or when they start to sag. To zap odors, hang them in the bathroom while you’re showering or freeze them in a plastic bag for a day or two.Photo: Christian Vierig/Getty ImagesYou Think High-Waisted Pants Are Always UnflatteringHigh-waist bottoms get a bad rap,probablythanks toan unfortunate Jessica Simpson style mishap, but when worn correctly, they can trick the eye into thinking you’re taller and leaner by elongating your lower body. The most slimming item to choose areslightlyhigh-rise slim-fitting jeans that hit your ankle, or simple high-black black trousers.You Think Sequins Can’t Be Worn During the DayA modern trick to looking like the most effortlessly stylish girl on the street: Pair dressy bottoms like a beaded skirt, or sequin pants) with casual staples like a white shirt, a gray crew-neck sweatshirt, or a black blazer. Likewise, choose topswith sequin detailing, and pair them with boyfriend jeans.You Don’t Store Your Pricey Shoes CorrectlyHaphazardlythrowingyour shoes into the closet is one of the worst things you can do, so if you’re going to keep them outside of a box or bag, nearly line them up in pairs on your closet’s floor or on a shelf with amplebreathingroom between pairs. Also, don’t store good shoes near direct sunlight, which can cause fading and majordiscoloration. Here are more tips on how to care for those designer shoes!You Never Get Anything TailoredThis is undoubtedlyone of the biggest fashion mistakes a person can make. Think about it: We’re all built differently, so mass-produced clothing won’t fit us all the same way. Having a tailor tweak hemlines, seams, sleeve lengths, even taking in too-wide garments can be the differencebetween looking fine and lookingabsolutely impeccable all the time.MORE:12 Comfortable and Stylish Must-Haves for Spring Under$100You Think Sexy Means Showing Tons of SkinIf you truly believe that sexy means dressing for stereotypical men—teeny-tiny skirts, skintight dresses, low-cut tops—you’re doing yourself (and your style) a giant disservice. Love your body and want to show it off? Great! Do it in ways that are truly sexy, as opposed to flashy—tight jeans and a silky top, a long-sleeve mini-dress with ankle boots, or a great pair of heels paired with a curve-hugging pencil skirt.Photo: Christian Vierig/Getty ImagesYou Swore You’d Never Wear Sweatpants Outside the HouseAs recent sportif trends have showcased, a well-fitting pair of track pantscan actually look very cool when paired with things like peep-toe booties or heels, and a structured blazer. See how to style yourshere.You Hoard Certain Items, Instead of Owning One Good OneObviously, we all have our staples, and we gravitate toward the same types of items when we shop—it’s called having taste. However, if you find yourself quite literally buying a cheapstriped shirt every single time you shop, it might be time to cut back. Not only does that mean you’re not satisfied with the shirts crammed into yourcloset, but it’s a knownfact that the more you own, the less you wear.If you’re still on the hunt for the perfect Breton stripe shirt (or black button down, white jeans, Chelseaboots, or whatever you buy over and over), take all the versions you own out and give them a good, hard look. Donate or sell the ones you’re not in love with, and take some time to hunt down the perfect one, as opposed to stocking up on a bunch of mediocre ones.You Buy into the ‘Take One Accessory’ off School of ThoughtWe hate when women regurgitate the dated rule that we should always remove an accessory before leaving the house. Why? Because fabulous women likeIris Apfel and a host of fashion bloggers, jewelry designers, and street-style stars have proven time and time again that piling on the bling can be fabulous and totally idiosyncratic.Photo: Sciulli/Getty Images for Sunglass HutYou Think Short Girls Can’t Wear Maxi SkirtsIt’s common fashion folklore that small women simply can’t wear floor-grazing skirts and dresses, but luckily that’s been proven entirely false. In fact, a well-cut maxi skirt can actually give you the appearance of looking taller, as evidenced by petite gals, likeRachel Bilson,Rachel Zoe, andMary-Kate Olsen. Choose solid versions that skim the length of your body, which will create a long, vertical line (forego anything with thick pleats or too many layers). Be sure to keep your top fitted—a tucked-in T-shirt and a cropped leather jacket, for example—so as to not drown in fabric. Also, make sure the skirt’s hemline is as long as you can go without tripping, and add a pair of wedges or heels underneath.MORE:17 of the Most Stylish Items on Amazon Under$40You Think Denim on Denim Is a Fashion Don’tAlso known as a Canadian tuxedo, the easiest trick to rocking double denim without looking like you got lost on the way to the cattle ranch:Pair pieces of varying washes together, such as a light denim shirt with dark denim jeans, or a dark denim jacket with a light-wash pair of boyfriendjeans.You Stay Away from Black and NavyThis fashion rule still has its fair share of subscribers, but let us make it clear: Navy and black look extremely fresh together, as evidenced by recent collections from designers like Carolina Herrera, Miu Miu, Gucci, Prabal Gurung, and Céline. Plus, It-gals like Alexa Chung, and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen can’t get enough of mixing the hues.Even if it’s only adding a pair of opaque black tights to a navy blue dress, it’s a mistake to not try it out.Photo: Timur Emek/Getty ImagesYou Think Clutches Are Only for NighttimeIt seems the after-hoursstaple is fast moving into daylight, as we’ve been spotting countless influencers using small, strap-free bags during the day at Fashion Week, on various style blogs, and right here in New York City on any given day. While some are fairly casual, like oversized leather clutches, others are dressy (i.e., shiny gold clutches and beaded clutch bags), and all look fabulous with things like fadedboyfriendjeans.You Think Sneakers Are Only for the GymAs recent trends have proven, the right pair of sneakers can take you way beyond the gym. Between wedge sneakers, slip-on sneakers (ahugetrend for fall), and the rise of top bloggers and fashioninsidersrocking sporty Nikes, New Balance, and Adidas kicks with everything from sleek skirts toleatherpants, it’s clear that when styled with dressier pieces,sneakerscan add a modern twist to an outfit that’s not comprised solely of sweats.You BelieveShorts Have No Place on the Fall and WinterThere’s something incredibly cool and fuss-free about rocking a pair of shorts in the winter paired with opaque black tights and ankle booties. Stay away from shorts in summery fabrics like eyelet and cotton, but go ahead and rock shorts made from leather, wool, jacquard, even denim cutoffs, which offer a nice change of pace from skirts when paired withboots,tights, and achunkysweater come fall and winter.Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty ImagesYou Think Long Hair Makes You More AttractiveThis is a biggie: Far too many independent women want to experiment with new hairstyles, butbelieve that a mane of long hair makes them more attractive to themselves and to men. First of all, some of the most beautiful women in the world, including Scarlett Johansson, Beyoncé, and supermodel Jourdan Dunnhave embraced sexy chops. Secondly, not every woman was born to have super-long hair. In fact, many women end up looking betterwith acut that better showcases herfeatures.Not to mention, shorter lengths can also make petite girls look taller,and curvier girls slimmer.MORE:21 Celebrity Pixie Cuts That Will Inspire You to GoShorterYou Always Look like You’re Dressed as ‘Fashion’ for HalloweenMeaning: You’re a walking advertisement for trends and/or labels to the point where it looks like you have no point of view of your own.

A list like that might say you can’t wearultra low-rise jeans in your ’30s, but hello—look as Isabel Marant! The French designer pretty much exclusively sends super-low jeans down the runway. Sure, they’re styled in a more modern way than the low-riders of the early aughts, butthey’re still low-waisted jeans; so doesn’t it seem silly to rule them out because a list tells you to?Age-appropriate styling is really what you should be following, which means knowing how to take pieces you like and making them look chic without being trendy, comfy without being messy, and vaguely sexy without being overt.40 Fashion Mistakes That are Ruining Your Style | @stylecasterA version of this article was originally published in October 2014.

Mejuri's New Enamel Rings Nail 2021's Hottest Jewelry Trend,"Despite what the opening scene of “The Devil Wears Prada” and its many stiletto-clad aspiring editors may have you believe, fashion loves an ugly shoe. Well, so long as its the right kind of ugly, that is. Clunky, clinical, and vaguely orthopedic-looking footwear has been elevated in recent seasons from fashion taboo to street-style staple—just look at the resurgence of Birkenstocks, Teva’s collaborations with Opening Ceremony and Nasty Gal, and, most recently, the gem-embellished Crocs Christopher Kane sent down the runway at his tenth anniversary show last month at London Fashion Week.MORE: The 50 Most Important Bags from the Spring ’17 RunwaysFor Spring 2017, designers have doubled down on their affection for all forms of maligned shoes: on top of the Crocs, there were flip-flops (Dolce and Gabbana, Alexander Wang, Dries van Noten), water shoes (MSGM, Markus Lupfer), Teva-esque velcro sandals (Emporio Armani, Maison Margiela, Anna Sui),and a second coming of the Chinese mesh slipper (Noon By Noor).Then there were those that presented new silhouettes sure to confuse most of the straight male population, such as Paco Rabanne, whose tube-sock-sandal hybrids my coworker helpfully described as “condoms for your feet,” and Gucci, whose four-inch flatforms were topped withwallpaper-floral ankle-boot uppers.MORE: How to Wear the Biggest Jewelry Trend of Spring ’17 Right NowAnd while sure, ugly-chicmay not be for everyone, these will no doubt find plenty of fans among the more adventurous fashion crowd.Below, get a taste of what we’re all in store for next season with 21 of the most divisive pairs of shoes from the Spring ’17runways. 0Thoughts?1 of 21Gucci Spring 2017Christopher Kane x Crocs Spring 2017Maison Margiela Spring 2017Prada Spring 2017Dolce and Gabbana Spring 2017Paco Rabanne Spring 2017Anna Sui Spring 2017Anya Hindmarch Spring 2017Christopher Kane x Crocs Spring 2017Emporio Armani Spring 2017Fendi Spring 2017Maison Margiela Spring 2017Markus Lupfer Spring 2017MSGM Spring 2017Noon by Noor Spring 2017Paco Rabanne Spring 2017Prada Spring 2017Stella McCartney Spring 2017Toga Spring 2017Undercover Spring 2017Hood By Air Spring 2017Next slideshow starts in 10s11 Quick 60-Second Hairstylesfor Work and School "
"2020's Top Jewelry Trends Are All About Drama, So Layer Up","About a month ago, I got it into my head that I absolutely needed a pair of tassel earrings. Maybe it was something I saw on Instagram—actually yeah, it was definitely something I saw on Instagram—but I couldn’t type my search into Google fast enough.Sure enough, the pair I spotted on my feed were by Oscar de la Renta, and came with a $400 price tag—not engagement-ring expensive, sure, but more than I can justify spending on something that I’m embarrassingly prone to losing. So, to Etsy it was, where I scoured page after page of search results—my personal K-hole of choice—to find the perfect affordable dupes.MORE: Your Complete Guide to Plastering Yourself in ’90s Sportswear LogosIn the end, I settled on a vintage pair which, while far from identical, offered the same satisfying swinginess and length as my beloved Oscar earrings—but I was also impressed by the number of sellers offering handmade versions inspired by the classic design. Amid all the Pinterest-perfect nameplate necklaces and steampunk-style watch pendants there’s actually a surprisingly deep trove of modern, cool jewelry on the e-commerce site.So, as a bit of a test, I decided to see if I could do the same with some of the other pricey baubles the fashion industry is currently obsessing over—using Etsy as well as some indie jewelry designers and affordable mass retailers.

Chunky Chain Bracelets to Instantly Elevate Your Look,"We all know the transformational power that adding the right jewelry can have on an ensemble.The “less is more” mantra that’s informed accessorizing best practices in years past has become downright dated, thanks to the enduring advent of maximalism (which frankly, has made fashion a lot more fun). That said, maximalismhas complicated things; statement jewelry options are now basically endless, meaning accessory decisions are harder than ever to make.Here at StyleCaster, we’ve taken to simplifying our accessory repertoires a bit. We’ve traded statement necklaces, bracelets and rings for statement earrings this holiday season, and we haven’t looked back.While oversized statement necklaces, French girl-approved coin chokers and chunky cuffs can offer any ensemble an instant upgrade, earrings can complement your outfitand your hairstyleand your makeup look—and even your bone structure, too. Best of all, because statement earrings tend to be more understated than other forms of costume jewelry, they practically invite you to play with texture, embellishment and pattern in a way you might not otherwise think to.The best part? Statement earrings pair just as well with formal wear as they do with plain white tees; they’ll elevate any outfit—whether it’s the LBD you’ve relied on for years, or the just-rolled-out-of-bed look you threw together before brunch this morning.Statement earrings are the must-have accessory that’s as understated as it is maximalist—and as versatile as it is statement-making. And we can’t get our hands on enough. Whether you’re looking to inject a little fun into your tried-and-true earring rotation, or whether you’re a die-hard maximalist looking for her next accessory fix, we’ve got you.Ahead, our favorite statement earrings on the market right now—all of which you could sport to a New Year’s Eve party, and then repurpose for casual wear all 2019 long.Shopbop.Rachel Comey Marquee Earrings, $185 at ShopbopThese translucent, art deco-inspired studs are versatile enough to pair with anything.BaubleBar.Dulcinea Drop Earrings, $42 at BaubleBarThese crystal-embellished drop earrings feature a pop of blush resin detail, giving them atouch of femininity.Farfetch.Oscar de la Renta Tassel Earrings, $395 at FarfetchThese luxe tassel earrings are like your favorite eye-catching red lipstick—but for your ears.Net-a-PorterAlessandra Rich Crystal Clip Earrings, $345 at Net-a-PorterThese crystal-adorned studs give any look a touch of playful charm without giving off childhood playing-dress-up vibes.Mango.Rhinestone Pendant Earrings, $29.99 at MangoThese pendant earrings look extra luxe peeking out from side parted hair style.Free People.Reflection Asymmetric Earrings, $38 at Free PeopleMismatched earrings are one of jewelry’s biggest trends du jour, but they can come across as totally casual if you style them right.Net-a-Porter.Rosantica Strobo Crystal Earrings, $315 at Net-a-Porter’80s-inspired clip-ons will give any look a touch of retro-glam appeal.Nordstrom.Kate Spade New York Pouf Earrings, $68 at NordstromThe marabou trend that’s adorned footwear and handbag key chains for years has finally made its way up to the ears.Matches Fashion.Oscar de la Renta Chain Cluster Beaded Earrings, $594 at Matches FashionBecause nothing holds its own against a beaded dress like a pair of beaded earrings.Revolve.LPA Angel Hoops Earrings, $98 at RevolveEncrusted with eye-catching pearls, these aren’t your everyday hoops.Nordstrom.Kendra Scott Fabiana Statement Earrings, $250 at NordstromThese animated sunburst earrings are sure to add a touch of drama to your look without competing with any of its elements.Free People.Dannijo Rose Earrings, $258 at Free PeopleThese classic gemstone earrings get a romantic upgrade with rose stud detailing.ShopBop.Zimmerman Orchid Statement Earrings, $395 at ShopbopPetal details are always pretty, but these chic drop earrings exude a “cool girl,” appeal thanks to the mismatched lengths and sculptural cut.Nordstrom.Something Navy Rhinestone Chandelier Earrings, $29 at NordstromFor a more modest statement, opt for these chandelier earrings.

Hailey Bieber's Gold Body Chain Makes Her Bikini Look Even Hotter,"For the 2016 shopper seeking jewelry with a personal touch, there are monogram pendants, birthstone rings, or bracelets inlaid with gemstones spelling out a codeword of your choice.Or, there’s Swedish designer Cornelia Webb‘s Molded collection, which takes the body’s very bone structure and skin texture as the jumping off point for a range of sculptural, minimal jewelry unlike anything you’ve seen before.While she’s based in Stockholm, Webb was in New York last month to celebrate the brand’s takeover of indie marketplace Tictail‘s Lower East Side boutique. There, the statement chokers and dramatic body chains that she made her name with during the first few years of her decade-long career were displayed alongside her newer, more delicate pieces: druzy drop earrings, rings inlaid with slices of granite, and necklaces molded to mimic the shape of the collarbone. Webb, a former medical student, doesn’t shy away from the human body: she’s used her own to make casts of thumbs, nipples, knuckles, ankles, and more, creating everything from silver-plated pendants to brass-and-marble rings.MORE: How to Wear the Biggest Jewelry Trend of Spring ’17 Right NowThe nipples, strung from chains to be worn around the neck, have been a particular hit—perhaps in part because it’s not immediately obvious what they are. “Women have seen [the nipple pendant] in magazines and been like, ‘What about that hat that you have?’ And we’ve been like, ‘Uhhh, we don’t really have a hat…’ This has been really popular with both men and women.”Not that her customers are prudes by any stretch. “When we started playing around with the metal waxes and casting the nipples, I did full breasts,” she recalls. “We’ve had requests for bespoke services from customers who are like, ‘Can you do my breasts now before I get old?'”Webb does, in fact, offer custom jewelry in addition to the ready-made pieces she sells at Tictail, Net-A-Porter, Harvey Nichols, and elsewhere—but, you do have to visit her in Stockholm, or else catch her at a stop like the one she made in New York for an appointment. There, she’ll make a cast of your chosen body part in wax, then bring it back to her workshop in Bali, Indonesia to hand-make the piece—and while bespoke items are pricier than her typical collections (which, for the most part, retail from around $35 to $250), they’re also guaranteed to be as unique as you are.Even if you can’t snag a custom piece, the personal element is present throughout Webb’s oeuvre—you’ll find a fingerprint or two on almost every piece, whether on the surface of a signet ring or the back clasp of a choker necklace. Not only does this give them a handcrafted feel you don’t get with mass-produced pieces, it also reinforces the human connection, which to the designer may be the most important part.“The more you wear jewelry, the more you’ll love it and the more important it becomes,” she says. Almost, you might say, like second skin.MORE: These Canadian Jewelry Designers Are Killing It Right Now 0Thoughts?1 of 9Cornelia Webb Folded Cuff, $191; at TictailCornelia Webb Wired Stone Body Chain, $191; at TictailCharmed Pinky Necklace, $191; at TictailCornelia Webb Molded Collarbones Cutout Necklace, $269; at TictailCornelia Webb Molded Signet Square Ring, $118; at TictailCornelia Webb Molded Wrist Medium Bracelet, $146; at TictailCornelia Webb Wired Spiral Earring, $107; at TictailMolded Knuckle Ring, $101; at TictailCornelia Webb Slized Ear Cuff, $64; at TictailNext slideshow starts in 10sHere Are the GigiHadid-Designed Boots That Are About to Sell Out "
Anklets Are Summer 2019's Coolest Jewelry Trend,"You’ve slipped on your favorite dress, slid on a pair of kitten heels, and slicked your hair back into the perfect bun. You’re almost ready to walk out the door but your look is missing one major thing: details. Whether you identify with the “less is more” or “more is more” school of thought regarding fashion, both parties can agree that the best outfits include some kind of accessory. Summer’s jewelry trends have been solidified (and spoiler alert: they’ll easily last through the fall) and they’re just what you need to add that extra dazzling detail to your outfit.One of my favorite things about jewelry trends is that they aren’t as volatile as fashion trends. High-quality jewelry usually has sentimental value and also often comes with a higher price tag. This means that jewelry trends stick around for a more extended period of time because people aren’t looking to part ways with their favorite pieces.I take the personal approach of investing in my everyday staples like a simple gold chain, studs, or name initial ring and then letting myself have fun with less expensive costume jewelry. I also think finding inspiration from your friends and family is helpful. For example, my mom has a gold coin jewelry set that she’s worn throughout the last 20 years. The set makes a statement and has never gone out of style—I always admire the look of it when she wears it so I’d be willing to invest in a similar piece!The top jewelry trends this summer fall into the investment and trend categories. For example, the chain link necklaces, sleek silver hoops, and floral jewelry all have incredible longevity. If they tire out at any point, you know they’ll always eventually come back. On the trendier end, we have charm bracelets and initial necklaces. Both of these trends are meant to be customized which makes them great gift options—fashion is always more fun when you can share it with a friend.iMaxTree.1. FloralsFlorals are often associated with summer dresses or the tablescape at a dinner party, but the trend is in full bloom in the accessories sphere. Floral earrings are especially having a moment and are a fun twist on the whimsical look of tucking a flower behind your ear. The style works with statement earrings, flower-encrusted hoops or bracelet charms.iMaxTree.2. Sleek Silver HoopsOk if you haven’t caught on by now, all the hot girls and guys are wearing silver hoops. Big or small, stacked or single, silver hoops are still the coolest thing you can put in your ears (sorry Airpods). Feel free to mix metals and add a combination of silver and gold to your ear stack.iMaxTree.3. Chain Link NecklacesYou’re going to want to link up with this jewelry trend—literally. Chain link necklaces are the perfect everyday accessory and can be customized to your lifestyle. For example, I wear two delicate link chain necklaces every day that add subtle detail to my outfitsandI don’t have to take them on and off to sleep, shower, etc. You can choose how heavy you want the metal to be, how many you want to layer and if you want to add charms to your stack.iMaxTree.4. Initial JewelryJewelry is so personal and the initial and name jewelry trend proves it! Wearing a customizable name necklace, initial ring or both is a fun way to make a “this is me!” statement. Initial jewelry can also be a meaningful way to show your connection to someone else—whether it’s your significant other, parent or child’s initials, adding a piece to your collection will keep them close to you all day.Getty Images.5. Charm BraceletsCharm bracelets are back and better than ever. Tap into early 2000’s nostalgia with a decked-out charm bracelet on your wrist. Charms are a fun way to show off your niche interests, give your friend a meaningful gift, celebrate a memory or create a #twinning moment. "
"So Everyone Is Obsessed With Pearls Now, Right?"," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.It’s easy to get caught up in revamping your wardrobe to fit the season’s latest trends. But between the cut-outs, faux fur coats, low-rise jeans, and dip-dye, the fashion trends may begin to seem overwhelming when the outfit options become endless. When you’re standing in the dressing room of Zara trying to determine which item to purchase, let me remind you that jewelry is often what makes and completes an outfit. So keep your fashion simple, grab your favorite black sweater or white button-down and shift your energy to focus on the jewelry trends for 2023. From simple silver hoops to bold bangles, there’s a jewelry trend to add a little extra flair to any look.While clothing always tells a story, jewelry is considered to be more personal. You may already have a signature piece that you wear every day or something with deep sentimental value. Oftentimes, these personally valuable pieces lean on the side of individual taste more than a trend, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do both. The best part of jewelry? Layers, stacks and statements pieces. The hardest part is picking which pieces to pair together!I interviewed jewelry designer and curator, Stephanie Gottlieb, for an expert opinion on how to play into 2023’s biggest jewelry moments and the key to finding a balance between trendy and timeless.First and foremost, if you’re looking to invest in your personal jewelry collection, it’s best to prioritize purchasing pieces that will maintain quality and value.“I always recommend for a new buyer to start with the classics like diamond studs, a tennis bracelet, or a diamond stack bands and then if you’re wanting to introduce the trendy pieces do that after you’ve already built the wardrobe of the staples,” Gottlieb advises. But when it comes to trendy pieces, Gottlieb says the opposite, “Buy costume to start and upgrade over time as the budget allows. You can sprinkle in less expensive fashion-forward trendy pieces.”Tom Ford; iMaxTree.Her advice seems simple enough—invest in quality, play with quantity! Luckily, 2023’s jewelry trends give you the opportunity to do a bit of both. Classic silver and gold pieces aren’t going anywhere—if anything, they’re getting more popular. If you’ve already built a collection of Hailey Bieber-inspired gold hoops (I sure know I have), consider mixing in some silver metal and vice versa. Don’t be afraid to upgrade your classic metals but simply goingbigger.According to Gottlieb, “We’re going to see a big comeback of the ‘80s and still some of the ‘90s. Think lots of chunky gold jewelry, big hoops and geometric shapes.” Based on the Spring/Summer ‘23 runway shows, Gottlieb is spot on.Keep reading for the five biggest jewelry trends expected to shine throughout 2023 (hey, it’s never too early to start wearing them!).Tory Burch; Jonathan Simkhai, iMaxTree.Totally CuffedA silver or gold cuff is the perfect example of a way to make a subtle statement with just one piece. Cuff bracelets are proving themselves to be the easiest way to elevate any look. The silhouette is often just a thick, arched curve but the impact is big! For starters, cuffs are usually adjustable which means you can wear them in multiple ways. If you prefer a classic look, add a cuff (or two) around your wrist to shine under the sleeve of your shirt or sweater. To make the trend more interesting, slip the cuff up your forearm like the models wore at Missoni, or opt for a wrap-around cuff as seen on the models at Tory Burch.Courtesy of Banana Republic.Hammered Cuff BraceletThis silver cuff has a wave structure to it which will help reflect light and make it super eye-catching. Plus, it’s only $30 so it’s a great way to try out to trend without feeling handcuffed to it.   Hammered Cuff Bracelet $30 (was $50)     Buy Now Courtesy of Karine Sultan.Four Row CuffI love this tiered cuff for special occasions. Pair it with a strapless or slip dress to add dimension to your look.   Four Row Cuff$98     Buy Now Jil Sander; Missoni, iMaxTree.Superior SilverGold has been associated with first place for long enough, it’s silver’s time to shine. Oversized silver statement hoops were a staple on the spring/summer ’23 runway and the second I saw Bella Hadid wear them during the Jil Sander show, I was sold. I’m putting my bets in now that she repeats the silver hoops for a street-style moment. Oversized silver hoops are another ’80s trend but they look incredibly modern when paired with 2023’s runway trends. For everyday wear, consider downsizing the hoop size (your ears will thank you) and leave the big guys for special occasions.Courtesy of Stephanie Gottlieb.35mm Tube Hoop EarringsIf you plan on wearing a pair of earrings on a daily basis, it’s definitely worth investing in a pair that won’t irritate your ears or tarnish. This pair of tube hoops by Stephanie Gottlieb are actually made with 14k white gold and are well worth the higher price point.   35mm Tube Hoop Earrings $520     Buy Now Courtesy of Zara.Rectangular EarringsSometimes it’s just easier to go with a faux-hoop (aka stud). This pair from Zara has a unique rectangular shape that will pair great with your go=to blazer.

Whether you’re stacking multiple strands of the same beads, mixing and matching, or just letting a singular strand speak for itself, this boho trend is a casual way to accessorize. Take notes from Blumarine, the totally Y2 K-inspired brand, and add a charm to a beaded strand, or get inspired by Coach’s quirky decision to add unusual objects to a long strand like a sports whistle. You don’t need to wear a flower crown or long skirt for beads to work with your outfit.Courtesy of Nordstrom.Carabiner Beaded NecklaceSpeaking of unconventional objects, this beaded necklace comes with an adorable carabiner charm and makes the perfect gift for an outdoorsy friend.

Well, we’re bringing the essence of the trend back in a significantly less-cringy way with dangly boho earrings. Whether the earrings have feathers, fringe or simple just hang past your collarbone, this earring trend is a fun alternative to the sparkly night-luxe earrings we were seeing last season (and work significantly better for daytime activities).Courtesy of Anthropologie.Circle Drop EarringsTe studs on this pair of circle drop earrings totally look like a full moon!

I love this pair of charm hoops with long tassel ends.   Jaxon Stone Hoop$28     Buy Now Patbo; Laquan Smith, iMaxTree.Bangin’ BanglesBangles are back and I’m not mad about it! Bangles are like a cuff bracelet’s fun younger sister–they may not be as sophisticated but they certainly know how to party! The ’80s-inspired accessory is a great way to play up a look for a night out and show off your personality. If you don’t already have bangles stored away from an old Halloween costume, take this trend as an opportunity to build your collection—and I literally mean build it! Building a stack of bangles is the most creative way to participate—geometric shapes, clear acrylics, and animal print patterns are all fair game.Courtesy of Asos.2-Pack Bangles in Clear and BlueThis is a trend you certainly don’t need to break the bank for. This set of 2 bangles is under $15 and would look amazing with a sparkly mini dress or skirt for girl’s night.   2-Pack Bangles in Clear and Blue $14.50     Buy Now Courtesy of Alexis Bittar.Molten 14K Goldplated Hinged Lucite BraceletIf you can’t help but splurge on a boujie bangle, I recommend this gold-plated lucite bracelet by Alexis Bittar.

Why Jewelry Is the Best Staple Piece to Pass Down Generations," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.I’m very lucky because my mom is a total fashion icon. When we go shopping together, we almost always leave with matching fashion finds. For this reason, the mother-daughter matching jewelry trend is perfect.I’ve been stealing her clothes, bags and jewelry for as long as I can remember and incorporating them into my own wardrobe. I even got caught trying to bring some of her items to college with me (my mission was unsuccessful). I love the idea of coordinating jewelry because it’s a way to bring everyday sentimental value to both of our looks. It also saves us from being too matchy-matchy and doubles our options (because we obviously still swap pieces).Coordinating jewelry, especially in a mother-daughter sense, doesn’t need to feel like a gimmick. Don’t get me wrong, I was a huge fan of matching friendship bracelets and half-heart necklaces as a kid but I want my grown-up jewelry to feel a little more elevated.Now I look for easy ways to build continuity between our collections. One way this can be done is by focusing on a motif, like the stars or the moon, and finding pieces within that theme. I also love the idea of choosing a stone or jewel and finding jewelry that features the same element.AP Images.Zoë Kravitz and her mom Lisa Bonet do an incredible job of coordinating jewelry in a way that still speaks to their individual personal styles. Kravitz’s gold earrings and body chain compliment Bonet’s bird brooch on her collar and gold hoops.A lot of jewelry brands also have signature styles that they incorporate throughout most of their pieces. By shopping for jewelry from the same brand, there’s a good chance that the design elements will be consistent throughout—you can take a brand’s signature style and make it one you and your mom are known for wearing.AP Images.If being subtle isn’t your thing, take a page out of Kris and Khloe Kardashian’s book and go bold. The Kardashian duo not only wore bright diamond earrings, but coordinated their twisted glitter dresses. This is a fun way to make sure everyone is aware of family ties at functions.Whether you’re pairing earrings and bracelets or rings and necklaces, mother-daughter jewelry is so sweet and sentimental. Mother’s Day is also quickly approaching so this is a great way to get your mom and yourself (for the sake of the trend of course) something special.Keep reading for my favorite coordinating picks.A Pearl PairPerhaps the most classic way to coordinate with your mom is by wearing complementary sets of pearls. Pearl jewelry is a staple of sophisticated style but can also allude to the more carefree fashion of the 1920s. Pearls are currently having a modern resurgence and are being incorporated into heavy chain necklaces, huggie earrings or other gem clusters. This means that even if you are a die-hard Y2K grunge-girl and your mom prefers a classic strand, you can still coordinate jewelry and have a meaningful connection.To The Moon & BackIf you’re into astrology or just love spending a long night under the stars, moon and star-themed jewelry is a great way to connect with your mom and the great unknown. Stars are super on-trend for jewelry right now so it’s easy to find celestial gems to wear. One of you can sport a crescent moon necklace while the other wears sparkly star earring studs (or vice versa) to stick with the theme. If you want to get multiple siblings in on the look, a moon and star charm bracelet is also a fun option for everyone to wear.Diamonds Are Your Mom’s Best FriendYou don’t have to have an heirloom engagement ring to connect to your family with diamonds. Diamonds come in all shapes and sizes which makes them easy to personalize and fun to mix and match. A matching pair of small diamond studs are great for everyday wear and will be a subtle daily reminder of your mom. Having different pieces in the same shape or setting is another way to have a subtle #twinning moment. Diamonds are also available in moissanite and lab-grown alternatives so you don’t have to break the bank to participate. "

I tend to pick a few more expensive pieces of jewelry and wear them for months without taking them off. Because of my long-time commitment to jewelry I end up gravitating towards timeless pieces but recently, the spring jewelry trends for 2022 have caught my eye.Suddenly, I’m interested in switching out my classic gold jewelry for understated silver.

"2018 Might Be Long Gone, but Coin Jewelry Isn't","I’m the type of gal who sticks to a few gold earrings or a simple gold chain and calls it a day, so I never thought I would be one to gravitate toward colorful jewelry. But if 2021 has taught me anything so far, it’s that I should probably branch out and try new things, and my newfound color obsession is making it that easy. Case in point: I have (somehow) fallen head over heels for the enamel jewelry trendthat has been taking over my social media feeds. Luckily for me, these rainbow-brite pieces don’t seem to be going away anytime soon.It all started when I spotted a pair of Mejuri’s enamel hoops while aimlessly browsing the web the other night and instantly fell in love. I thought it was simply because I was tired, so I shut my laptop and tried to forget about them—but I couldn’t. Turns out, that was just the beginning of my enamel jewelry spiral. Now, I’ve found tons of different options at literally every price point imaginable, and they’re all sitting in my cart waiting for me to pull the proverbial trigger and place a slew of orders.So, I’ve rounded up 13 of my favorite pieces of enamel jewelry to share with you, in hopes that I won’t be the only one impulse-shopping. And when I say these price points are good, I mean it! There’s a gorgeous enamel yin yang ring that you can buy on Amazon for under $12 bucks—although big spenders may want the original almost-$700 Bea Bongiasca ring that put the enamel look on the map.As Cyndi Lauper once said: I see your true colors and they’re shining through on any of these pieces of colorful enamel jewelry. Read on to see a few of my favorite rings and earrings from incredible jewelry brands guaranteed to get you on board with this colorful trend come spring.

Peridot and Green Enamel Ring $96.75      Buy Now  Courtesy of Mejuri.These Rose Quartz HoopsAt $100, Mejuri’s Monochrome Hoops are a great way to treat yourself to this trend without dipping toofar into your savings.

It retails for under $12, so you don’t have to stress about splurging on a trend piece. If you don’t want to wear it every day and risk speeding up the tarnishing process (it’s only $12, after all!), try styling it on a thin gold chain necklace for an alternate way to wear.

Gold Signet Initial Rin$50     Buy Now Courtesy of Bea Bongiasca.This Dreamy Vine RingI had to include at least one super splurge-worthy item onto this list, so my apologies to your credit card!

Adding these to my cart ASAP before I get all emotional.   Enamel Huggie Hoop Earrings$17.14     Buy Now Courtesy of Mejuri.This Beautiful Blue RingSimply put, I am obsessed with this ring.

Monochrome Ring$75     Buy Now Courtesy of Roxanne Assoulin.These Funky Rainbow HoopsRoxanne Assoulin has won the fashion world over with her collection of playful and colorful jewelry, and these hoop earrings are actually a bit more subdued when compared to her other pieces.

5 Upcoming Fall Fashion Trends That Are Actually Groundbreaking,"Our opportunities to experiment with style took a massive hit over the last year, but the accessories we chose to wear while working from home were our saving grace. I seriously miss the days prior to then where I could put on “real” pants and deck myself out in every blingy earring, bracelet and necklace in my jewelry box. Now that we’re starting to go out and about again, hopefully, Mejuri’s brand-new enamel rings can help me get a handle on some of 2021’s biggest jewelry trends.I once thought colorful jewelry was a thing of the past. Sure, I used to stack on bright bangles and plastic rings when I played dress-up as a kid, but I’ve opted for wearing more understated pieces made from gold or silver since becoming a real adult. That said, it looks like Mejuri is officially making colors cool again with their new selection of enamel pieces, and I’m surprisingly here for it. The collection includes two ring styles and a pair of hoop earrings that come in shades of green, brown and blue. If you’re a true magpie at heart, don’t fret—these enamel pieces are adorned with a single shiny stone in the center for an added blingy bonus.All trends really do end up coming back around. Similar to the pearl jewelry craze that took over my Instagram feed last month and revived the look I once considered stuffy and outdated, enamel is being completely reinvented in 2021. In Mejuri’s collection, the colors are more understated rather than bold or intense, so they’ll play well with your favorite metallic pieces and chunky gold chains. Just like everything else Mejuri sells, these rings are just bold enough to make a statement.Add a few of these rings into your collection for a playful pop of color this season. Read on to see all of the pretty shades.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

"Name Jewelry Is Having a Moment, Because Carrie Bradshaw Is a Forever Fashion Icon","It’s hardly a stretch to make the argument that last year’s biggest overarching jewelry trend was the Instagram-famous coin necklace, endorsed by countless influencers, style editors and street style stars alike. It makes sense that this classic jewelry style went remarkably viral, as coin necklaces offer the utmost versatility, thanks to their infinitely stackable appeal (the coin and nameplate duo have remained a popular layering combo)—punctuated, of course, by their inherently vintage charm. This spring, though, there’s a new influencer-approved jewelry trend on the block: seashell jewelry.Not only are gilded seashell-shaped designs cropping up as adornments on necklaces, but the resort-ready motif is also a dominant embellishment for rings, statement earrings and hair accessories this season. Even ’90s-era puka shells are coming back to life in modernized jewelry styles that—don’t worry—aren’t exact replicas of the throwback styles beloved by teenage surfers of decades’ past.Before you begin to cringe at this beachy trend’s somewhat startling resurrection, know that today’s puka-imbued jewelry has been revised with polished updates that prevent the designs from looking like an artifact of ’90s ska culture—or some overpriced souvenir purchased at the hotel gift shop during your childhood family vacation. And, if you still need further proof that the unlikely style’s return to fashion is, in fact, a thing, look to none other than Gigi Hadid, who was spotted sporting a puka choker during Paris Fashion Week.Of course, if you can’t even entertain the idea of bringing back the vacation-inspired chokers of your youth, there are plenty of other shell-designed iterations of this under-the-sea trend that feel a bit more refined. Traditional conch shell designs, spiraling shark eyes, and sophisticated sand dollars with opalescent finishes feel more sophisticated (and office-appropriate) than kitsch or novel.And let’s be clear about one thing: last year’s coin necklaces are a timeless, ultra-wearable jewelry piece, so we’re certainly not writing them off as a thing of the past. But if you’ve grown tired of the endlessly ubiquitous coin trend, opt for one of these fresh, under-the-sea (and summer-ready) alternatives, instead.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

The Best Mask Straps & Accessories To Make Wearing One Way More Fun,"I’ve never had a particularly kitschy fashion sense, but lately, accessorizing with a bit of whimsy just brings me joy—hence why I’m leaning into 2020’s fruit jewelry trend so damn hard. Somewhere between the cottagecore/picnic aesthetic and the classic Girl Next Door exists a perfect blend of the two: The Girl Next Door Who Owns Too Many Plants, Has A Window Sill Garden & Wears Fruit Jewelry. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m happy to announce that I am she. She is me. We are one.But to be clear, I’m not the only one in love with the look. After luxury brands like Mercedes Salazar debuted fun, fruity accessories for summer (I’ve been dreaming about their Tropics Strawberry Earrings for months) and Insta-famous brands like Et Toi Paris littered my Explore Page with cutesy fruitsy jewelry, it seemed the trend was everywhere—and don’t even get me started about the amount of fruit jewelry on Etsy. It’s not to be believed, y’all. Whether or not you think a salad complements your meal, a fruit-themed accessory can and will complement your outfit, so don’t hesitate to try the trend out.Bella Gerard.My personal recommendation for cute statement fruit jewelry that doesn’t look cheesy? I’ve been lovingUK-based brand I’MMANY London‘s Summer Capsule ’20, full of strawberries, grapes and the like. I’MMANY’s collection is about as chic as produce-themed jewelry can get, and the star of the show are undoubtedly their wide array of cherry earrings.

Are Sunglasses Lanyards...Cool Now?,"There are few celebs I admire more than Hailey Bieber when it comes to off-duty style. I honestly can’t think of a time when I didn’t want to copy something she’s worn—and if her Instagram feed is any indication, it looks like Bieber is ready to serve up inspo for my entire summer wardrobe, especiallymy beach outfits! The model just posted a pic in the most delicate gold body chain and I’m obsessed with her take on styling body jewelry for 2021.ICYMI: It’s May, people! Summer is here and no one is more ready for warm weather than Hailey Bieber. I mean, she’s already showing off her bikini collection on the ‘gram and I’m taking detailed notes! Her most recent post featured a baby pink string bikini from TRIANGL paired with the real star of the show, a glimmering body chain by Jacquie Aiche styled with two coordinating diamond necklaces. She topped off her look with a pair of chunky gold hoop earrings and a few Y2K-inspired mini ponytails around the crown of her head. Yup, copying this look ASAP!         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Hailey Rhode Baldwin Bieber (@haileybieber)If the words “body chain” traumatize you, fear not. These are not the chunky waist chains of the early aughts! Bieber’s version is of a far more delicate nature, which feels much more modern and chic. It also makes the accessory more wearable in my eyes. You can style it like she did over a bikini or wear it under any number of crop tops for some added glitz. Forget other jewelry trends of the season: This summer is all about the beachy body bling.Bieber’s chain was covered in diamonds and costs more than a few thousand bucks, so no, it’s not exactly affordable. But you can still get the look for less! I was able to source a few inexpensive options for you to buy right now if you are trying to copy her blingy bikini vibes. Each of the body chains below retail for under $15 bucks; read on to snag one for yourself.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

Hoop Earrings So Truly Massive You Could Probably Fit Your Head Through Them,"When I was a wee elementary schooler, nothing—and I meannothing—made me feel as cool as I did when I wore an anklet. The early-aughts anklets trend empowered me to feel like a beach beauty and badass surfer girl rolled into one. As I lived in middle Tennessee, I was basically never wearing an anklet on or near the beach (or really, anywhere other than Kroger or Target). But I feltcool. I felttransported. I felt like the kind of fashion-forward 8-year-old I knew I was every time I spent hours styling and re-styling my Polly Pocket dolls. 2019’s take on the anklets trend has basically left me feeling the exact same way.These days, my time outdoors is no longer spent near-exclusively at Kroger and Target. And my time spent indoors is no longer spent near-exclusively styling Polly Pocket dolls. (Don’t fret—I’ve been sans Polly Pocket since middle school. You are not reading a fashion story penned by a 25-year-old who still plays with dolls.) I am still in middle Tennessee, so decidedly far from basically any beach—leaving me anything but a beach beauty or badass surfer girl (or some endlessly cool hybrid of the two). I’m an editor who spends her days writing in coffeeshops, working out at the YMCA and—when I’m feeling fancy—eating at Nashville’s trendiest restaurants. None of these settings lend themselves particularly well to anklets, especially now that I’m a 25-year-old with a full-time job andnot an elementary schooler who can basically wear anything she damn well pleases.It’s been challenging, then, for me to wrap my head around the 2019 anklet renaissance. As a fan of basically every retro revival to hit the zeitgeist, I’m predisposed to love it. But as a bona fide adult with a 9-to-5, I’m perplexed as to how—and where—to wear it. Anklets’ beachy connotations leave them feeling ill-fit for the office—let alone any semi-fancy affair, like a party or nice dinner. But I’ve reached a simple conclusion: Anklets are simply too fun to overthink. They’re abundantly on offer in every fast-fashion retailer imaginable, they’re priced competitively, and they’refun. They still make me feel cool and fashion-forward, even if I haven’t figured out their best sartorial application. And they still transport me—just in a slightly different way. Instead of making me feel like my toes are in the sand, they make me feel like my toes are in the fluffy carpet that lined the floors of the house where I grew up—or in a pair of jelly sandals, following my mom’s grocery cart as she darted from aisle to aisle at Kroger.Nostalgia is a beautiful thing. It’s also a fun thing.

"47 Out-of-the-Box Pearl Pieces to Shop, Because Can You Ever Have Too Many Pearls?","These ain’t your grandma’s pearls! The pearl jewelry trend blowing up this season is all about adding modern twists to the classic strand. We’re talking statement earrings, mismatched sizes and plenty of stackable rings. After tons of pearls were spotted at the inauguration ceremony this week, I realized just how badly I wanted a strand of my own. The second I typed “pearls” into Google, though, hundreds of options popped up. I should have figured that just about everyone in the world would want some, too.Pearls are often typecast as stuffy, but the look received a revival via TikTok when Gen-Z fashion gurus started showing off their Vivienne Westwood necklaces as the finishing touch to their cool-girl vintage ‘fits. The VW versions retail for hundreds of dollars and are pretty much sold out everywhere at the moment, but there are tons of other trendy brands selling pearls right now to consider. Brands like Mejuri, Missoma and Maison Irem sell alternatives that I can actually afford and totally love, so it looks like I’ll be purchasing more than a few pieces this season.Surprisingly, real pearls on their own aren’t all that expensive, so this use this trend as the perfect excuse to treat yourself without breaking the bank. Whether you opt for a string of real pearls or go for an authentic-looking (and cheaper) imitation version, you’re gonna want to wear these pieces with everything.Keep reading if you’re ready to think of this classic style in a whole new light.

10 Autumn Accessory Trends You Best Believe I'm Shopping This Fall,"As someone who was never an avid jewelry wearer growing up (I also attribute this to my horrible taste in fashion — early 2000s kids will know), I’ll be the first to admit that when I heard of using jewelry as an heirloom, I was a bit confused. I mean, why not leave me a house or better yet, a briefcase full of cash? But then I received a present from my mother for Christmas. It was a ring and I was instantly in love — it’s also a much more practical gift than a briefcase of cash. I thought to myself, this is a ring I will wear forever, as it’s simple, classy, and timeless. So timeless in fact that I thought, “this is a staple piece I could hopefully pass down to my future kids.”Passing down jewelry from generation to generation is not a new concept, but it is one that I feel isn’t as prominent as it used to be. Maybe that’s because the jewelry trends have changed so much throughout the years, we wouldn’t be seen wearing something from the early 1900s. Or perhaps, you’re more inclined to wear vintage clothing rather than vintage jewelry (no judgment, here!). Either way, I am 100% prepared to make the case for why jewelry is the way to go when it comes to keeping something in the family. If you’re a skeptic, buckle up because, by the end of this article, I’ll make a jewelry heirloom believer out of you.It helps preserve memoriesOur loved ones unfortunately aren’t going to be around forever. Luckily, we have ways of remembering them, whether it be our memories, old photographs, the names we choose to give (I can attest to this as my middle name is my grandmother’s name), and of course, jewelry. If you consider yourself a fashionista already starting to think about your legacy and how you want future generations to remember you, passing down a timeless infinity bracelet will ensure you’re always known as “the one in the family who had great style.”Pandora.   Pandora Moments Infinity Knot Snake…$85     Buy Now Things always come back in styleLet’s face it — trends always come back in style. Round glasses? Check. Wide-leg pants? Check. Thin eyebrows? Check (unfortunately). My point is if you think those earrings you’re thinking of passing down won’t be in, come 20 years from now, chances are you’re mistaken. Trust me, I’ve seen firsthand how fashion has evolved over time and one thing’s for sure — fashion always makes a comeback. Take the Sparkling Halo Heart Hoop Earrings from Pandora for example. They’re giving me early 1900s Titanic Hope Diamond vibes and I am so here for it.Pandora.   Sparkling Halo Heart Hoop Earrings$115     Buy Now It’s practical andsentimentalJewelry is something we’ll actually wear if passed down (as opposed to a ball gown). Whether you’re going to work, a fancy event, or spending an evening out with friends, accessories are the perfect addition to an outfit. And if you’re wearing (or decide to pass down) a piece of jewelry to or from a family member, that piece will always hold some sentimental value. One practical, yet stylish Pandora jewelry piece is its Sparkling Tennis Bracelet. It makes the perfect gift for any occasion given its history dating back to the 80s, and one that anyone would be thrilled to wear for years.Pandora.   Sparkling Tennis Bracelet$115     Buy Now It’s valuableBecause it’s a family heirloom that is passed down, that means it only needs to be paid for by the initial wearer. It’s no secret that jewelry can get expensive (think thousands of dollars), which is why passing a piece down generations is a thoughtful gesture. The value of a certain accessory can also go up over time so you’ll definitely want to get something that’s worth every penny like Pandora’s gold-plated Sparkling Round Halo Ring.Pandora.   Sparkling Round Halo Ring$115     Buy Now You can make something new from itFun fact: any piece of jewelry can be repurposed or redesigned into a brand new piece. So, if you’re looking to make your grandmother’s old diamond earrings into a ring, or earrings into a necklace, it is possible. If not, there are plenty of jewelers out there who know how to clean and repair old items. Until then, enjoy the staple pieces like these 14k gold-plated stud earrings with clear cubic zirconia while you can until you pass them on for the next person in your family to wear.Pandora.   Sparkling Round Halo Stud Earrings$115     Buy Now It always makes the perfect giftWhether you’re passing down a piece of jewelry for Mother’s Day, a birthday, or just because, accessories are always a great way to show the style icon in your life how much you love them.

The Chicest Fall Accessories Trends—and Ways to Shop Them All,"Giving your children piercings and other body modifications is a tricky topic for lots of people—meaning even Kylie Jenner gets mom-shamed for Stormi’s hoop earrings. The Keeping Up With the Kardashiansstar debuted baby Stormi’s latest look on the ‘gram, only to be met with a barrage of criticism over the hoops. Clearly, plenty of these commenters never had their ears pierced as babies (a practice that is commonplace inmanycultures and communities). Or even if they did; some appear to just be trolling the star and her daughter, for hate’s sake.The toddler, who recently celebrated her second birthday with Kylie and dad Travis Scott, didn’t seem bothered. Yet concerned citizens weighed in via Instagram’s comments section, levying cries of abuse and Stormi acting too “grown-up” for these big, bad hoops (which, lest we forget to mention, are even personalized with her name).One user went so far as to suggest that Stormi could face undeserved criticism for looking “ghetto” with these earrings. “lil sis this little baby is cute… however she’s too young for earrings this size…” wrote Instagram user @antoniamoore9229.“From a mother of another black girl…we don’t put earrings on our little girls that size and style because we don’t want people to talk about our kids in negative ways…and calling our children ghetto,” the user added. “she’s an adorable little girl…please save the earrings for her until she’s 12 or 15 years old.” Um.         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Kylie 🤍 (@kyliejenner)We’re going to chalk that one up to a difference in perspectives. What weshouldbe weighing in on is why anyone would term Black jewelry trends as “ghetto” in the first place, whether or not they’re on a baby (this writer from the Bronx wore hoops as young as Stormi, thank you very much).

Urban Outfitters' Summer 2019 Collection Is Exactly as Cute as You'd Expect,"As anyone with an Instagram knows all too well, coin jewelry pervaded the zeitgeist in 2018. Celebrities and “it” girls, alike, adorned their necks with lightweight metal discs meant to look like money—breathing new life into the layered jewelry trend that’s endured for years on end. Though the shell jewelry movement threatened to upend coin jewelry’s reign, it turns out the two aren’t mutually exclusive, after all. Both coin jewelry and shell jewelry are making their way into 2019—offering us a veritable plethora of statement jewelry to choose from.This summer’s coin jewelry trend isn’t the far cry from last year’s you might expect. Coin pendants still abound, leaving minimalists with plenty of ways into the continued trend. But 2019’s coin jewelry movement has seen some maximalist remixes, too. Heavy coin chokers are on offer—so are lengthy chain necklaces, crafted from coin-covered string upon coin-covered string. Now that the aughts have crept into our day-to-day, coin belts are seeing some traction too. As are coin statement earrings—and layered necklaces that capitalize on both the coin jewelry trend and its competitor, the shell jewelry trend, at once.All this is to say: Your favorite retailers have ensured that it’s never too late to hop aboard the coin jewelry bandwagon. If last year’s trend came and went before you had a chance to wrap your sartorial mind around it, you’re in luck, because you still have a whopping season (who knows—maybe even more) to embrace coin jewelry in all its shiny glory.1.

71 of the Best Spring Statement Earrings Money Can Buy,"Ah, fall fashion. I couldn’t love it more if I tried! Fall is definitely my favorite season when it comes to styling, as I can combine my favorite aspects of winter (like chic jackets and fun layering) and summer (like showing some skin and playing with color) to create an especially dreamy wardrobe. This season, I really want to go all out, so I’m shopping the top fall fashion trends early to get ahead of the game.What’s in, you ask? The classics. Oversized blazers and slacks will be making a highly anticipated return but this year, they’re joined by cozy striped sweaters and ballet flats (cue gasp). Yes, ballet flats! The shoe we all thought was doomed to being an early 2000’s fashion faux pas has made a triumphant comeback. Hopefully, you’re ready to give them a second turn.Denim is also eager for a reinvention beyond baggy jeans and jackets and is coming in at full force in dress form. I dare you to layer a denim tank dress over a striped sweater (it’ll be amazing).As for accessories, maximalist jewelry is still all the rage. Statement pendants are the coolest way to express yourself this season. Keep reading for the cutest options on the market.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do. Mejuri and Urban Outfitters are STYLECASTER sponsors, however, all products in this article were independently selected by our editors. Please note that if you purchase something by clicking on a link within this story, we may receive a small commission of the sale.Super Oversized PantsWhen it comes to fall bottoms, the baggier the pant, the better. Just ask Hailey Bieber, who’s always seen in a new pair of parachute pants when she’s off duty or supporting Justin at a show. This trend is a callback to the ’90s and we’re here for it. Especially when it’s paired with a tighter top to balance out the weight of the ensemble. Even better: basically any shoe looks good with these bottoms. Ballet flats, chunky sneakers, boots, trainers you name it.Courtesy of Urban Outfitters.Balloon Cargo PantsGet the look of cargo pants with the comfort of cotton bottoms when you wear these balloon trousers. This pair from Urban Outfitters comes in so many unique colorways that will help you add a pop of color to whatever outfit you’ve got planned. In our opinion, the bolder and brighter you go, the better.   iets frans… Balloon Cargo Pant$75     Buy Now Courtesy of Everlane.The Way-High Drape PantYes, it’s possible to bring the baggy pants trend to the office. Case in point: these checkered bottoms from Everlane. They still give your legs the freedom to move around unrestricted but have a bit more structure to them so that HR would approve.   The Way-High Drape Pant$128     Buy Now Sailor StripesStripes are a pattern that comes in so many widths, colors, and formats that it never goes out of style—unlike cheetah print which runs in just as fast as it runs out. However, there are moments where stripes break out of their preppy affiliation and find their way into every aesthetic. This is one of those moments. Sailor-style stripes in the classic navy and white pairing are about to be hanging over every fashionable set of shoulders this fall. The pattern looks great in a loose-knit weave sweater, long sleeve t-shirt or even on a blazer. Pro tip: always check the men’s selection of sweaters if you love an oversized look.Courtesy of Mango.Striped Knit SweaterIs it a little too early to be wearing a full-on sweater? Yes. Will you be dreaming of this sweater the second temperatures hit 50 degrees? Also, yes. Make the move and get this cuffed sweater in anticipation of cooler days ahead. This chocolate version is available in sizes XXS-4X.   Striped Knit Sweater $59.99     Buy Now Courtesy of Cos.Knitted Half Zip SweaterIf you were obsessed with the summer edition of the coastal grandmother esthetic, then you need a half-zip to keep the fun going through the fall. The style is the perfect combination of sporty and preppy—and looks much cuter than wearing a sweatshirt.   Knitted Half Zip Sweater$135     Buy Now Ballet FlatsBallet flats have been trying to make a comeback for a few seasons but I’m here to report that it’s finally show time. Now before you decide this trend isn’t for you, I beg you to take a deep breath and let go of the grudge you have against ballet flats. I promise that nobody is asking you to wear them with skinny jeans or a skater skirt. Instead, picture yourself wearing them with linen slacks, chic midi skirts, vintage denim and even a low-rise mini skirt. Cool right? I’m so excited to embrace this trend and become the shining star of Balletcore.Courtesy of Zara.Bow Trim Leather Ballet FlatsLeave it to Zara to have the coolest (and most affordable) version of the trend. This pair of metallic ballet flats are a great maximalist take on the trend. They also come in pink and black.

Denim dresses come in strapless, long sleeve, mini and maxi dress form—and they’re all amazing.Courtesy of Mango.Button Denim DressThis long denim dress is the ultimate layering piece.

"Opal Jewelry to Shop, Because Iridescent Is the New Black","I spent a decade of my life at summer camp. Yes, that means ten whole summers spent sitting in a cabin in New Hampshire!

Shop The Exact Gummy Bear Ring From Olivia Rodrigo's New 'Brutal' Video,"Anyone who knows me well will not be surprised to hear that tropical jewelry sits at the intersection of everything I love about fashion. The tropical print revival has long been one of my favorite trends, as its roots in “ugly” fashion run deep. Call me ascetic, but few things sound more fun than digging up some fascinating, by-all-contemporary-definitions ugly piece of clothing and rendering it trendy, chic, covetable. Nothing—not even a shirt embraced only by frat bros and dads on vacation—can trump creative styling. Tropical prints are fun, and unexpected, and challenging. And statement jewelry is delightfully campy no matter what form it’s taking. 2019’s tropical jewelry trend, then, is a marriage of two lovely, lovely things.Summer 2019 has, by all measures, really only just begun—but it’s already seen an array of statement jewelry trends enter the zeitgeist. Fruit jewelry has shown us our taste buds and our taste in clothing have more in common than we’d think. Last year’s shell jewelry trend is back and perhaps even more eye-catching than ever. And the somewhat recent friendship bracelet trend has reminded us all of the importance of wearing our hearts on our sleeves (or really, on our wrists). Tropical jewelry is joining a vast and varied cast of statement-making players—all of which are sitting idly by on digital shelves, just waiting to add a healthy dose of personality (and a trendy dose of camp) to your accessories arsenal.Though some of this season’s other jewelry trends are limited in terms of form (friendshipbracelets, for instance), tropical jewelry spans genres. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a necklace person, or an earrings person, or awhatever person—you’re sure to find a trendy piece that’ll work for you (though it bears mentioning that tropical earrings are particularly abundant). So what are you waiting for? I’m serving you a veritable plethora of ways to keep your love of the tropics close to heart and mind at all times—all you have to do is scroll down.1.

The M Jewelers and CASETiFY Just Made *the* Chicest Phone Cases I Ever Did See,"And the award goes to…the STATEMENT NECKLACE! If you didn’t have time to watch the Oscars red carpet, I hate to break it to you, but you missed a lot of great looks. To bring you up to speed, allow me to present the number one Oscars 2020 jewelry trend: Necklaces.The abundance of statement necklaces on the carpet positively blew me away, and it seemed like everyone from Janelle Monae to Florence Pugh had a neck drenched in diamonds. Even though these celebs wowed in dresses that were eye-catching all on their own, many chose to couple them with chunky necklaces that were just as impressive, and it’s an accessory trick I’ll most definitely be copying for my next night-out look.Check out the biggest and blingiest necklaces of the night below, as well as a few glitzy options for trying out the look yourself.Photo: ShutterstockJanelle MonaeJanelle Monae’s spectacular hooded gown is the kind of dress that needs no accessorizing, and yet she took things one step further with a blinged-out choker to match her sparkling ensemble.Photo: ShutterstockMindy KalingMindy Kaling’s necklace isn’t just gorgeous— it’s ex$pensive. During her red carpet interview, Kaling told Ryan Seacrest that she had to have a bodyguard accompany her all night just to make sure it was safe! The Zaxie To the Moon and Back CZ Tennis Necklace gives off the same dripping-in-diamonds vibes, but at just under $100, it’s likely quite a bit more affordable than Kaling’s priceless piece.Photo: ZaxieZaxie CZ Tennis Necklace$95Buy NowPhoto: ShutterstockZazie BeetzZazie Beets wins my vote for Best Statement Necklace of the night.

Feminist Jewelry Makes a Statement in More Ways Than One,"Surely it would surprise no one to hear me call name tags a necessary evil. No onewants to adorn themselves with a glorified human label—an adhesive one that ruins their outfit, no less.But. One of 2019’s most visible sartorial movements—the name jewelry trend—has called this logic into question. Maybe we don’t mind wearing glorified human labels. Maybe we enjoy adorning ourselves with our names. Maybe welike accessories that do the talking—or at least, the introducing—for us.In its first iteration, the name jewelry trend was perhaps most iconically sported by two abject style goddesses: Carrie Bradshaw (of fictionalSex and the City fame) and Princess Diana. Diana was spotted, on many occasions, sporting a short necklace emblazoned with the letter D. And asSATC fans know well, Carrie wore a “Carrie” necklace throughout the show’s tenure. (The necklace even became a central plot point in one episode.) This trend, as all trends are wont to do, trickled out of the zeitgeist. And then it trickled back in. Name jewelry is now available in basically every jewelry format—earrings, chokers, bracelets, hair accessories—and basically every name format, too (which is really just to say, you can go to Diana initial route, or the Carrie full-name route).And those who find themselves a bit put off by the whole wearing their name 24/7 thing can rest assured knowing a sub-iteration of the trend has re-emerged, alongside the name jewelry one.Word jewelry—accessories inscribed with various words (notnecessarily names)—is as abundantly on offer as name jewelry is. You can sport your favorite curse word. Or announce how #blessed you are to the world. You can don jewelry that renders you a self-proclaimed queen. Hell, you can even wear Marc Jacob’s name in hoop earring form, if that were ever a thing you’d dreamt of.So crack open a dictionary and remind yourself of all your favorite words. Odds are, they’re currently available in accessory form, just waiting to be sported by the likes of you.[sc-button price=”85″ url=”https://www.shopbop.com/logo-hoop-marc-jacobs/vp/v=1/1513051330.htm” title=”Marc Jacobs The Logo Hoops”]We weren’t kidding when we said the Marc Jacobs thing.

What started this past spring as a hunt for cloth face masks (any cloth face masks) turned into a hunt for pretty cloth face masks—which, in turn, became a hunt for ways to make wearing said masks more fun. Enter: mask straps, chains and other accessories that turn your (necessary) face mask into a full-blown lewk.If you’re skeptical about adding accessories—and, in particular, achain—to your mask, I hear you. But these beauts aren’t your grandma’s glasses chain. Both chunkyand dainty chains and straps have had a major comeback (They look really cute on sunglasses, FYI!), and the trend has transitioned seamlessly to work with all your favorite face masks. Typically, you just clip the accessories onto your mask and go! Before you know it, your safety measure will become a vital part of your outfit.Of course, there are chains and other mask accessories forall types of styles. You could opt for a pearl-adorned mask chain to give your mask a bit of a 1920s or preppy vibe, for one. Or, pair your simple black face mask with a colorful mask to spice things up. You can also go with a classic gold link mask chain, too—especially if you’re really into 2020’s jewelry trends. And if chains aren’t your thing, there are headbands and hair clips to help you keep your mask looking cute AF as well!

Memorize These 40 Style Mistakes Immediately,"Each year brings with it several trendy retro revivals—most cyclical, most expected. Trends come and go, and then come back again; such is the way the sartorial world works, and we’re typically excited to see old favorites making a comeback. But every so often, a vintage trend creeps into the zeitgeist and sees a resurgence none of us could have possibly predicted. Such was the case with dad sneakers, tropical prints and the enduring bike short. And now, sunglasses chains (known by many as sunglasses lanyards) are seeing a similar treatment.Earlier this month, a Free People representative told StyleCaster that sunglasses lanyards—chains that attach to the sides of your sunglasses and drape behind your head, like a backwards necklace—were poised to be big come summer 2019. And the summer accessories that retailers have on offer have only backed up this assertion. Nasty Gal, Urban Outfitters and Free People are littered with chains meant to adorn your sunglasses (or even your regular glasses), because in the age of maximalism, everything deserves a little accessorizing.We get it—this is oneseriously strange trend. Eyeglass chains feel classically vintage, whereas lanyards reek of frat bro origins. This is one odd couple that never deserved a meet-cute. Yet they got one, and when the result of this union is as sophisticated-yet-unabashedly-fun as sunglasses chains are, it’s kind of hard to be mad, no?1.

Consider Yourself Warned: 'Ugly' Shoes Are Trending Hard for Spring '17,"Jewelry trends are among the strangest around. In 2018, we thought it advisable to hang faces from our ears. So far in 2019, we’ve grown attached to adorning ourselves with glorified nametags, sporting fruit-shaped baubles of all kinds and extending our tropical print obsession into the accessory sphere. We’ve also taken our mild obsession with hoop earrings to a new level; the hoop earrings trend has become the big hoop earrings trend, which has since become thetruly massive hoop earrings trend. A huge hoop is simply not an adequately huge hoop unless it’s huge enough to stick your entire head through.Our initial resurrection of the hoop earrings trend was a nod to the early aughts, when hoop earrings were as abundant as low-rise jeans, butterfly clips and chainmail. Metallic textiles and shiny embellishments abounded, accentuated by the circular metal hoops we hung from our ears. Though we’ve revived a great many 2000s-inspired sartorial movements, hoops have pervaded the zeitgeist unlike any other (perhaps because they’re a bit more approachable than, say, that iconic sparkly cowl mini that hardly covered Paris Hilton’s body at all). But, as we and our camp-loving hearts are wont to do, we’ve taken hoop earrings to their most voluminous extreme. We’ve demanded that they not only be circles, but that they be enormous circles—gargantuan circles. If a hoop earring isn’t big enough to graze our shoulders—or more dramatically, our collarbones—is it even a hoop earring at all?!We’d be remiss not to admit that wearing truly massive hoop earrings is a power move in its own right. And surely, being able to shove your head through your earring is a pretty impressive party trick. But all we really want to know is: Where will it end? Will we not be satisfied until hoops have become so colossal that we can fit our entire selves through them? That we can hula hoop with them? That we can loop them ’round our houses—nay, our yards? Will hoop earrings continue growing and growing until they envelop our earth?Only time will tell. For now, there is shopping to be done—and there are huge hoop earrings to be had.

Where to Find Affordable Alternatives to Cult Designer Jewelry,"Growing up, pearl jewelry epitomized one thing and one thing only: classic glamour. Pearl pieces were to be paired exclusively with ball gowns and fancy gloves, making them a favorite of mine any time I went to play dress-up. As time went on, though, pearl jewelry was remixed, and then remixed again. It no longer felt exclusively reserved for the upper echelons of society; new iterations left the jewelry trend accessible to any aesthetic. And these days, pearl pieces are almost as commonplace as rhinestones were during the early aughts.Now that we’ve lifted the veil of exclusivity that once barred pearl jewelry from the masses, out-of-the-box pearl pieces have made their way into fast-fashion retailers. Pearl-covered barrettes are on the sartorial menu. So are pearl-lined chokers and pearl-dotted bobby pins. Pearl-covered hoops have offered jewelry designers a way to capitalize on two earring trends at once; the hoop-drop hybrid feels endlessly edgy, no matter how many times it’s done.The best thing about pearl jewelry isn’t its classic appeal or its aesthetic versatility—but the fact that it’s never a bad buy. No one will ever reminisce on the pearl jewelry they’ve purchased with buyer’s remorse or trend-follower’s regret. Pearl pieces are nevernot chic, no matter how out-of-the-box they are. Pearl jewelry is a no-fail purchase, and given the immense variety of unique pearl jewelry on the market right now, there’s never been a better time to stock up.1.

Meet the Designer Taking 'Personalized' Jewelry to the Next Level,"Something about spring just makes us want to shoe-shop. (Maybe the fact that we’ve been wearing the same damn pair of snow boots every day since October?? Maybe??) Now that we’re shedding layers, trading sweaters for T-shirts and whipping out our favorite relaxed jeans on the reg, we’re in dire need of footwear that feels as fresh as our spring wardrobes. That means spring heels, spring wedges and spring flats in every possible shape, texture and color. Budgets, beware—we’re coming for these shoe stores, and we’re coming for them hard.We’d be lying if we said spring flats were the first thing we thought to stock up on this season. Once we handled our sundress and swimsuit situation, we moved into top-of-mind accessory domains—namely, spring heels and wedges. Heels feel party-worthy and wedges feel vacation-worthy. In other words, they’refun, and once winter starts to wear off, we can’t bear the thought of practicality any longer. But. Once it gets hot out, no one has the energy to run around in heels and wedges all day—at least, we don’t. So when we’re getting dressed in the morning, we never find ourselves reaching for the spring heels and wedges we just bought. Those are occasion pieces, not everyday ones—and that’s exactly why spring flats are so vital.Flats get kind of a bad rap. Like we said, flats tend to get lumped in with other practical necessities—leaving them feeling kind of, well, un-fun. But the current selection of spring flats is anything but. Seriously, some of the mules, sandals and loafers on offer at your favorite retailers right now are seriously cute—cuter than some of the spring heels we’ve seen this season, and definitely cute enough to warrant a spot in your fun rotation. If you’ll let them, spring flats will elevate even the laziest of spring ensembles, and they’ll keep you comfortable while they’re at it. That’s a sartorial win/win if we’ve ever seen one. So give spring flats a chance (and a quick perusal), won’t you?1. All Black Colorblocked Slides, $149 at AnthropologieThe easiest way to dress up a tee-and-jeans combo? Slip into these.2. Fabric Moroccan Barbouches, $49.90 at ZaraWho needs beach sandals when you can wear these woven flats, instead?3.

Your Everything Guide to August's Birthstones,"Statement earrings are always a good idea. But spring statement earrings are an even better one. Because no matter what day it is or what the weather’s doing outside, adorning your head with colorful, personality-filled baubles is just plain fun.But if it’s a Friday and it’s sunny outside and you’re adorning your head with colorful, personality-filled baubles, you’ve basically hit a fun jackpot. Warmth, the weekend and cute AF statement jewelry is a trifecta that truly cannot be beat.Naturally, shopping spring statement earrings has become one of our favorite pastimes in recent months. The moment the spring equinox came and went, we traded our go-to black Chelsea boots for fresh white sneakers, we swapped our sleekest black skinnies for relaxed mom jeans, and we dropped our sophisticated silver hoops to make room for, well, every pair of spring statement earrings we laid eyes on. During winter, minimalism reigns, so accessories are pretty easy to manage. But during spring and summer, maximalism comes out to play, leaving the statement jewelry landscape vaster and more varied than ever.Color is on the menu. So are kitschy shapes. So is every combination of beads and pearls and rhinestones you can possibly imagine. It’s not enough to render hoops in glitter-infused resin—you have to cover them in beads that boast paint strokes in every shade of the rainbow. Dream up a truly strange pair of spring statement earrings, and get ready to whip out your credit card—because they probably already exist. Whether you’re a fan of drop, hoop, stud or evenclip-on styles, there’s at least one pair of spring statement earrings designed with you in mind. Honestly, there are probably a few.So drop those dainty hoops and shelve your favorite studs for a while. Your go-to spring outfits are simply canvases for all the exciting accessories that await you. Stock up—and start playing.1.

Knee-Length Denim Shorts Are the New Bike Short,"Humans will never be mermaids. Or fairies. Or unicorn queens. Or the myriad other fantastic creatures that inspire our aesthetics, our Halloween costumes, our dreams. But the enduring iridescence trend has allowed us to get closer to a reality in which we are these dreamy, wonderful things; if we wear enough opal jewelry and drape our homes with enough holographic textiles, maybe—even if just for a moment—we can live out the fantasies that inhabit our imaginations.Dreams of modern-day fairytales aside, it’s impossible to look upon our modern-day love of all things iridescent with anything but absolute mesmerization. Mostly because, well, the trend is pretty damn mesmerizing. There’s something endlessly beautiful about the blend of purples, aquas and millennial pinks—the way iridescence reflects and captures light simultaneously, the depth of color that changes oh-so subtly every time you move your eyes. It’s hardnot to access the most imaginative portals of your mind every time you lay eyes on an iridescent bauble. Everything from holographic shower curtains to iridescent water bottles captivates the brain—with genuinely precious pieces, like opal jewelry, feeling the most bewitching at all.My aesthetic doesn’t lend itself well to iridescence. I’m a bright colors, bold prints, tactile-y grounded maximalist; iridescence’s airy beauty only gets lost when thrown into my heavy atmosphere. But even I can’t resists its charms. I’m as apt as anyone else to spend hours perusing shiny things—combing through the internet’s selection of truly stunning opal jewelry—simply because it’s a beautiful way to pass the time. So whether or not you’re on the market for a new iridescent ring, take a moment and lose yourself in a veritable sea of stunning opal jewelry. The practice is somewhat meditative—and at the very least, it’s fun.1.

23 Fashion-Forward Gifts To Give Your Most Stylish Friend,"I’m not one to say “I told you so,” but when I brought BONBONWHIMS to StyleCaster readers’ attention back in April, I knew it was the next big jewelry It Brand. Major fashionistas and celeb tastemakers like Kylie Jenner and Sofia Richie were already wearing the brand’s creative, colorful pieces—and slowly but surely, it’s amassed even more majorly famous fans. As I watched and re-watched the new music video for “Brutal,” I couldn’t help but notice Olivia Rodrigo’s jewelry in one particular scene.The “Brutal” video is, among other things, fantastic. In my opinion, it’s one of the best returns to music video-ing at its core that we’ve seen in a hot minute. And just as good as the concept and storytelling, of course, are the outfits. With portions of her face covered by virtual masks reminiscent of Instagram and Snapchat face filters, Rodrigo let her attire and accessories do the talking for the bulk of the video. That said, there was one piece in particular that stood out.In the classroom scene, Rodrigo paired a punky plaid skirt and a red tank that says “Flirt” with a red beret and braided pigtails. Finishing off the look, she rocked some silver oversized soda tab-style earrings by Pattaraphanand a rectangular, glittery red ring with a black gummy bear on top. That ring, of course, was classic BONBONWHIMS.Like it? Boy oh boy, do I have great news for you: You can snag one for yourself! BONBONWHIMS founder Clare Ngai isn’t one to send celebs exclusive pieces and leave their fans wanting something similar—she always makes sure they can get their hands on the real thing. In the past, fans went positively wild for a clear bubble ring worn by Ariana Grande, so I have no doubt that the aptly-named Brutal Ring will be the brand’s next big seller.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do. Please note that if you purchase something by clicking on a link within this story, we may receive a small commission of the sale.Courtesy of BONBONWHIMS.   Brutal Ring$65     Buy Now TBH, even if I wasn’t a fan of Rodrigo I’d want this ring. Gummy bear jewelry has been trending all summer, but I’ve been worried that the Rainbow Brite color scheme so many brands are pushing would wear itself out by fall. A classic emo-chic color combo like black and red never gets old! I love the thought of rocking this with an otherwise understated monochrome black look as a pop of something fun and quirky. Or, you know, as part of my inevitable Olivia Rodrigo Halloween costume.Her BONBONWHIMS ring isn’t the only fun accessory Rodrigo wears in the video; she also rocks some seriously cute (And affordable! Under $50!) chunky gold hoops with flower detailing by Notte, not to mention a bevy of early aughts-inspired hair clips in the final scene. Unrelated, but I’d go as far as to say that Rodrigo is bringing pigtails back. And strangely, I’m here for it?Courtesy of Geffen Records.Bottom line, Rodrigo positively smashed her latest video. I’m thrilled that “Brutal” is her new single! It’s destined to have as much success as “Driver’s License” or “good 4 u,” just as I’m destined to copy her fashion choices and buy myself this gummy bear ring. Someone warn my credit card—it’s brutal out here! "
The 5 Biggest Trends from London Fashion Week,"Any solid festival wardrobe involves a combination of a few things: comfy clothes you can move around in all day (and night) long, pieces that are lightweight enough for midday humidity and cozy enough for breezy nights, and chic AF style. This last bit is, of course, the most fun part of this endeavor—and it’s the thing that leaves the festival clothes landscape feeling as delightful, exciting and Instagram-worthy as it does. It’s also the thing that makes me want to shop festival clothes, even though I’m not planning on attending a single festival this year.When I went to Bonnaroo some many years ago, my priority was fashion—not function. I spent my days in delightfully bohemian crop tops and short shorts that made my butt look excellent—until they rode up so significantly they basically served as a second pair of underwear. The versatile gladiators I relied on to tie my outfits together split apart halfway through the fest, leaving me in something of a footwear rut. (But hey—Bonnaroo’s an alternately dusty or muddy experience, and I simply wasn’t prepared to sacrifice any of my clean AF sneakers to the festival gods.) I wore rainbow snapbacks, adorned my hair with flower crowns and layered on Free People jewelry. My looks were photogenic as hell—but my head got seriously hot and sweaty, and I’m just not the kind of person who can stand to bounce around in beaded shit all day. By the end of the four days, I was basically relying on sports bras, tie-dye tanks and Nike shorts—a far cry from the fashion-forward looks I’d mentally assembled, but a much more practical option that kept me from getting distracted by my clothing every 19 seconds.I’ve been to a handful of festivals since then, and it’s become clear to me that the dichotomy between fashion and function is a false one—at least as far as festival clothes are concerned. The festival clothing selection is incredibly vast, and it’s full of pieces that are as practical as they are pretty (or weird, or statement-making, or breezy, or whatever other aesthetic you’re currently cultivating). Comfort and chic style are far from mutually exclusive; it’s entirely possible to craft a festival wardrobe fully of comfy clothes, and lightweight-yet-cozy necessities and head-turning looks. It’s, in fact, so possible (and so damn fun) that I’ve found myself planning festival outfits I won’t be able to wear any time soon—leaving you, dear reader, with a comprehensive guide to all the festival clothes worth shopping right now.1. Make My Day Set, $148 at Free PeopleA matching set so cute you’ll be tempted to live in it.2.

Olivia Palermo is Designing Under-$100 Jewelry,"Our political climate is, perhaps, at one of its most regressive moments in decades. But our social climate isn’t. From the initial Women’s March to the Me Too movement, feminism looms large—with many women feeling more emboldened than ever to fight on behalf of financial parity, equitable treatment and gender equality in every possible form. This feminism manifests in myriad different ways, with each woman paving her own path in the sociopolitical sphere. But it should come as no surprise that this massive cultural movement has trickled into the realms of art and fashion, giving rise to sartorial trends, like feminist jewelry, that mimic our social movements.Our graphic tees have become more defiant, emblazoned with slogans that demand more than they concede. Our hats have become, quite literally, more vulvovaginal, standing in as symbols of our strength, our pride, our womanhood (albeit one specific—and white—form of womanhood). And even our daintiest accessories—our jewelry—have undergone something of a feminist transformation. Adorned with frank, celebratory images of the female form or even franker political slogans, our necklaces, bracelets, earrings and rings have become outlets for our voices—empowering us to express ourselves in ways as subtle as they are statement-making.We’d be ignoring the metaphorical elephant in the room if we failed to address one simple truth: Fashion may feel like a commodified and frivolous approach to the feminist movement. Capitalism is a complicated thing—one that has entrenched many women, especially women of color, in poverty. And buying a political T-shirt is no substitute for getting involved in local politics, supporting feminist candidates or turning out to vote. However, we’re of the mind that the world is better with more pro-women stuff in it. And if a woman wants to nod to her politics while getting dressed in the morning, who are we to tell her she shouldn’t? In honor of International Women’s Day next week (and in honor of women in general), scroll through below to check out some of the best feminist jewelry pieces money can buy.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

These Weird Tattoos Are the Newest Beauty Trend,"Summer 2021 is all about overdressing, from accessorizing with over-the-top jewelry to styling fun-as-hell party pants on a regular basis. Yes, you read that correctly: I said Party Pants. They’re here in a big way to shake up your wardrobe this season—and I am 100 percent down to have some fun.It feels like the entire Internet is sick of wearing the same thing over and over.After a year spent mostly in our pajamas and comfy (albeit cute) matching loungewear sets, it makes sense that everyone would collectively be looking forward to trying something a little different. Maybe that’s the reason why over-the-top pieces like summer camp-inspired jewelry and party pants are trending these days. Consider these statement-making bottoms the maximalist version of those flared leggings that were trending on TikTok a few months ago. This season’s updated offerings come in way more colors and prints than just your basic black, though, from floral-patterned mesh to retro swirls to marble and so much more. No print is too bold and no color too bright when it comes to the humble party pant!What else makes a pair of pants party-ready, exactly? There are a few key signifiers for you to be aware of on your search. Oftentimes, party pants feature a high-waisted fit and a flared leg. Now, the extent of that flare is up to you—pick an option that’s a little more fitted for a relaxed vibe, or go all-out with a wider flare to make more of a splash. Of course, cutouts are always welcome to amp things up in addition to the aforementioned fun colors and prints.Regardless of how many versions there are, all party pants have one thing in common: They’re seriously cute.

New Blogger Jewelry Lines to Know,"Let’s get one thing clear: When we say fashion mistakes, we’re not talking about wearing an outfit that could land you on a worst-dressed list, if people were judging. Rather, we’re talking about long-held habits you refuse to break, fashion clichés you still believe are true, and small things you’re avoiding—or doing—that can wreak havoc on your personal style.From not getting things tailored enough (bad!), to buying into the idea that you have to throw certain things away before you turn 30 years old (stupid!), here are 40 fashion mistakes you should start remedying right now.Photo: Gotham/Getty ImagesYou BelieveWhite Shouldn’t Be Worn After Labor DayLadies, listen up: This is an antiquated rule that shouldn’t be followed.As countless designers and fashion stars have proven during the past fewseasons, white is not only appropriatewhen the weather turnschilly, but it’s also amazingly fresh and modern. One thing to keep in mind when tackling the white-in-winter trend: It’s all about the fabric. Lighter textiles such as white cotton, linen, canvas, and seersucker will look out of place during fall and winter, so be sure you’re reaching for white wool, cashmere, fur, mohair, flannel, silk, and leather.You Always Buy the Same Size in ClothesAs any woman who’s shopped high-fashion and fast-fashion knows, sizing can vary tremendously according to store, brand, and item. Cheaper clothing typically runs way bigger, making it common for a woman to wear, say, a size Large at Forever 21, but still be a size 2 in Stella McCartney. Don’t sweat the number—pay attention to how things look on your body instead.You Wear Retro Pieces Without a Modern SpinWe all know that fashion is cyclical and thateverythingcomes back around, but that doesn’t mean you shoulddress in full of-another-decade outfits, whichcould run the risk of making you look like you’re both in costume and 10 years older.Love the look of a wild, ’80s neon sweater you found at the Salvation Army? Leave the leggings and sneakers at home, and opt for a pair of super-sleek skinny jeans, natural hair and makeup, and a great pair of ankle boots. Found a vintage swingy midi-skirt? Style it with modern staples like a cropped leather jacket and a sleek pair of pointy heels, as opposed to wearing a pussy-bow blouse and pearls.MORE:How to Nail the Dad Sneaker Trend: A Shopping and StylingGuideYou Think ‘Dry Clean Only’ Tags Are Always CorrectIf a garment says it needs to be dry-cleaned, it won’t hurt to follow suit, but that can get pricey—especiallysince some items technically don’t need to beprofessionallycleaned. Many high-end brands that manufacture items in washable fabrics will often say “dry clean only” to keep up the higher-end vibe. Furthermore, certain fabrics, such as cashmere, actually hold up better when they’re washed by hand as opposed to getting dry-cleaned. Here’s a good guide to help you figure out what doesn’t really have to be cleaned by a pro.YouBelieveTall Women Shouldn’t Wear HeelsThis mandate isn’t only silly, but a little sexist, too. Stemming from a whole bunch of antiquated notions—including abundant height isn’t feminine, and a woman shouldn’t draw extra attention to herself—this rule is one no woman should ever follow if she doesn’t want to. We know plenty of women who are six feet tall and still rock killer heels with grace (ahem, Jenna Lyons, Charlize Theron,Michelle Obama, Karlie Kloss….)You Shop for InstagramWe hate to assume you’d buy anything simply so people know you own it, butsuchis the world in which we live. Are you buying thatBalenciagabag because you really, really love it, or because you want others to know you boughtit?If you buy those Jimmy Choopumps, will you be able to truly enjoy them without posting themto social media?If the answer is no, you might have some thinking to do about your shopping habits.MORE:100 Best Beauty Tips and Tricks You’ve GottaTryPhoto: Christian Vierig/Getty ImagesYou Avoid HorizontalStripes like the PlagueBuying into the notionthat all horizontallines make you look wide is a cliché mistake. Yes, we’ll admit that a skin-tight bodycon dress emblazoned with horizontal lines might only look good on a model, but pieces that are made well and fit well—think a classic cotton Breton striped shirt tucked into dark jeans, a ladylike full-skirt with horizontal stripes, or a great striped overcoat—flatters every woman.You Think You Can Only Wear One Bold Color at a TimeIf we’ve learned anything from the recent color-blocking phenom, it’s that a bold, saturated hue can look even better when paired with another bold, saturated hue. Wearing an emerald-green silk blouse? Don’t be afraid to wear those fuchsia suede heels or carry that sunny yellow leather clutch—you’ll look super-modern.MORE:51 Fashion-Forward Pinterest Accounts to Follow for Major StyleInspoYou Hate Shopping, so You Rely on the Same Old Dinosaurs in Your ClosetNot that into fashion or shopping? That’s fine, but you are probably into looking presentable, so it’s not the end of the world to replace those 15-year-old, square-toe brownloaferswith an updatedstyle, or replace your boot-cut black pants from the late ’90s with a pair that fits well and has a slimmer line. Go ahead and stick to the same styles, but just give them small updates. You’ll not only appear more youthful, but you’ll probably find you enjoy getting dressed a little more when you have modern pieces that fit.You Think Actual Menswear Is Just for MenObviously, you’re not going to pick up a suit at Rochester Big and Tall, but you’d be surprised by how many made-for-men pieces can work for you. This is especially true at common outposts like Forever 21, H&M, J. Crew, and Zara, whose men’s stuff—think slim-cut button-downs, sweatshirts, oversized sweaters, and utility jackets—often aren’t as trendy as their for-women counterparts, and offer a slightly slouchierfit.You Think Sweatshirts Are Strictly Casual WearOnce strictly for athletes, gym-goers, and errand-runners, the humblesweatshirthas risen to become a very stylish staple. Need proof? Top designers like Kenzo, Phillip Lim, Cynthia Rowley, and Karen Walker have been showcasing versions that are embellished and printed, while street-style stars started pairing their sweatshirts with swingy skirts, skinny trousers, and statement necklaces. And we’re not only taking about designer versions, either—your old heather-gray Hanes sweatshirt will do the trick nicely.Photo: Melodie Jeng/Getty ImagesYou Think Mixed Prints Are Way Too BusyActually, mixed prints can lookextremelyfresh, and elevate your look from ordinary to street-style ready in no time. Style pros know that anything goes when it comes to melding motifs (florals with stripes! polka dots with Ikat!), but beginners should start with this tip: Treating leopard or camo (or both) like neutrals is the easiest way to break into pattern mixing. Whatever colored print you choose, add a leopard or camo belt, shoe, bag, blouse, oranythingelse.You Think Mixing Gold and Silver is a Faux PasNot only is this idearidiculous, but it also causes you to miss out on some killer jewelry trends, like mixed-metal midi rings, delicate layered necklaces, or a seriously diverse #armparty.MORE:15 Insider Tips on How to Layer Jewelry Like aProYou Think You Can’t Wear Red to a WeddingThis somewhat ridiculous fashion rule was put intoplaceduring more conservative times when red was thought to be a way-too-sexy, attention-stealing color. Yes, you might want to stay away from wearing a skin-tight, red plunging spandex gown to a wedding, but you probably don’t want to wear that in any color. These days, there are tons of high-style red dresses that are perfectly acceptable as formal wear, as evidenced by the runways at fashion week and red carpets, on which celebrities often wear red gowns that look elegant and classic, as opposed to tawdry.A good rule of thumb: Choose red gowns with clean lines that are made from chiffon, silk, or organza, as opposed to shiny satin or anything too stretchy, and always keep embellishments to a minimum.You Get Caught up in One-Season WondersLet’s be clear: We certainly don’tthink every splurge needs to be something “classic” that’ll last until the end of time(where’s the fun in that?), but wedothink dropping a ton on something that’s so obviously the “it” item from one collection is silly.Why? Because there’s an excellent chancethat, after the season is up and the luster starts to fade, you might start to feel that your splurge was partially due to the immediacy of having something coveted, rather than having something you’ll adore long-term.You Think ‘Classics’ Have to Cost a Ton of MoneyMost women can’t—or prefer not to—drop a ton of cash on clothes every season, even onstaples we’re told will always be in style. That’s why off-price retailers such as TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Century 21 are so great for scoring realdesignerpiecesat a fraction of the cost. Even several fast-fashion stores like Zara, ASOS, and Uniqlo are upping theirgame and quality,offeringanarrayof timeless piecessuch aswool overcoats, leather Chelsea boots, wool and cashmere sweaters, and silk blouses at seriously wallet-friendly prices.You Think Faux Diamonds Are a Faux PasWhile fake designer bags are a hugedon’t, fake diamond studs in a reasonable size are a hugedo. Why? Because faux stones are hard to spot to the untrained eye.You Believe Loose Styles Flatter Plus-Size Women MostIt’s a myth that loose, flowy styles flatter a large bust or a plus-size woman. The area just under the bust is a woman’s smallest torso measurement, so emphasizing it with a structured waistband that hits higher than your natural waist will make you look a size smaller.MORE:13 Genius Curvy-Women Styling Tips We Can Learn from AshleyGrahamYou Think Jeans Should Be Washed as Much as Your Other ClothingDenim aficionados know that raw denim can take up to six months to break in and shouldn’t be washed until then.Why? Jeans really do conform to our bodies, and when you wash them, most of the shape is lost.Most jeans today, however, are treated (pre-washed to achieve a faded look) and don’t need to be broken in. These you can wash more often, butonlywhen they’re stained or when they start to sag. To zap odors, hang them in the bathroom while you’re showering or freeze them in a plastic bag for a day or two.Photo: Christian Vierig/Getty ImagesYou Think High-Waisted Pants Are Always UnflatteringHigh-waist bottoms get a bad rap,probablythanks toan unfortunate Jessica Simpson style mishap, but when worn correctly, they can trick the eye into thinking you’re taller and leaner by elongating your lower body. The most slimming item to choose areslightlyhigh-rise slim-fitting jeans that hit your ankle, or simple high-black black trousers.You Think Sequins Can’t Be Worn During the DayA modern trick to looking like the most effortlessly stylish girl on the street: Pair dressy bottoms like a beaded skirt, or sequin pants) with casual staples like a white shirt, a gray crew-neck sweatshirt, or a black blazer. Likewise, choose topswith sequin detailing, and pair them with boyfriend jeans.You Don’t Store Your Pricey Shoes CorrectlyHaphazardlythrowingyour shoes into the closet is one of the worst things you can do, so if you’re going to keep them outside of a box or bag, nearly line them up in pairs on your closet’s floor or on a shelf with amplebreathingroom between pairs. Also, don’t store good shoes near direct sunlight, which can cause fading and majordiscoloration. Here are more tips on how to care for those designer shoes!You Never Get Anything TailoredThis is undoubtedlyone of the biggest fashion mistakes a person can make. Think about it: We’re all built differently, so mass-produced clothing won’t fit us all the same way. Having a tailor tweak hemlines, seams, sleeve lengths, even taking in too-wide garments can be the differencebetween looking fine and lookingabsolutely impeccable all the time.MORE:12 Comfortable and Stylish Must-Haves for Spring Under$100You Think Sexy Means Showing Tons of SkinIf you truly believe that sexy means dressing for stereotypical men—teeny-tiny skirts, skintight dresses, low-cut tops—you’re doing yourself (and your style) a giant disservice. Love your body and want to show it off? Great! Do it in ways that are truly sexy, as opposed to flashy—tight jeans and a silky top, a long-sleeve mini-dress with ankle boots, or a great pair of heels paired with a curve-hugging pencil skirt.Photo: Christian Vierig/Getty ImagesYou Swore You’d Never Wear Sweatpants Outside the HouseAs recent sportif trends have showcased, a well-fitting pair of track pantscan actually look very cool when paired with things like peep-toe booties or heels, and a structured blazer. See how to style yourshere.You Hoard Certain Items, Instead of Owning One Good OneObviously, we all have our staples, and we gravitate toward the same types of items when we shop—it’s called having taste. However, if you find yourself quite literally buying a cheapstriped shirt every single time you shop, it might be time to cut back. Not only does that mean you’re not satisfied with the shirts crammed into yourcloset, but it’s a knownfact that the more you own, the less you wear.If you’re still on the hunt for the perfect Breton stripe shirt (or black button down, white jeans, Chelseaboots, or whatever you buy over and over), take all the versions you own out and give them a good, hard look. Donate or sell the ones you’re not in love with, and take some time to hunt down the perfect one, as opposed to stocking up on a bunch of mediocre ones.You Buy into the ‘Take One Accessory’ off School of ThoughtWe hate when women regurgitate the dated rule that we should always remove an accessory before leaving the house. Why? Because fabulous women likeIris Apfel and a host of fashion bloggers, jewelry designers, and street-style stars have proven time and time again that piling on the bling can be fabulous and totally idiosyncratic.Photo: Sciulli/Getty Images for Sunglass HutYou Think Short Girls Can’t Wear Maxi SkirtsIt’s common fashion folklore that small women simply can’t wear floor-grazing skirts and dresses, but luckily that’s been proven entirely false. In fact, a well-cut maxi skirt can actually give you the appearance of looking taller, as evidenced by petite gals, likeRachel Bilson,Rachel Zoe, andMary-Kate Olsen. Choose solid versions that skim the length of your body, which will create a long, vertical line (forego anything with thick pleats or too many layers). Be sure to keep your top fitted—a tucked-in T-shirt and a cropped leather jacket, for example—so as to not drown in fabric. Also, make sure the skirt’s hemline is as long as you can go without tripping, and add a pair of wedges or heels underneath.MORE:17 of the Most Stylish Items on Amazon Under$40You Think Denim on Denim Is a Fashion Don’tAlso known as a Canadian tuxedo, the easiest trick to rocking double denim without looking like you got lost on the way to the cattle ranch:Pair pieces of varying washes together, such as a light denim shirt with dark denim jeans, or a dark denim jacket with a light-wash pair of boyfriendjeans.You Stay Away from Black and NavyThis fashion rule still has its fair share of subscribers, but let us make it clear: Navy and black look extremely fresh together, as evidenced by recent collections from designers like Carolina Herrera, Miu Miu, Gucci, Prabal Gurung, and Céline. Plus, It-gals like Alexa Chung, and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen can’t get enough of mixing the hues.Even if it’s only adding a pair of opaque black tights to a navy blue dress, it’s a mistake to not try it out.Photo: Timur Emek/Getty ImagesYou Think Clutches Are Only for NighttimeIt seems the after-hoursstaple is fast moving into daylight, as we’ve been spotting countless influencers using small, strap-free bags during the day at Fashion Week, on various style blogs, and right here in New York City on any given day. While some are fairly casual, like oversized leather clutches, others are dressy (i.e., shiny gold clutches and beaded clutch bags), and all look fabulous with things like fadedboyfriendjeans.You Think Sneakers Are Only for the GymAs recent trends have proven, the right pair of sneakers can take you way beyond the gym. Between wedge sneakers, slip-on sneakers (ahugetrend for fall), and the rise of top bloggers and fashioninsidersrocking sporty Nikes, New Balance, and Adidas kicks with everything from sleek skirts toleatherpants, it’s clear that when styled with dressier pieces,sneakerscan add a modern twist to an outfit that’s not comprised solely of sweats.You BelieveShorts Have No Place on the Fall and WinterThere’s something incredibly cool and fuss-free about rocking a pair of shorts in the winter paired with opaque black tights and ankle booties. Stay away from shorts in summery fabrics like eyelet and cotton, but go ahead and rock shorts made from leather, wool, jacquard, even denim cutoffs, which offer a nice change of pace from skirts when paired withboots,tights, and achunkysweater come fall and winter.Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty ImagesYou Think Long Hair Makes You More AttractiveThis is a biggie: Far too many independent women want to experiment with new hairstyles, butbelieve that a mane of long hair makes them more attractive to themselves and to men. First of all, some of the most beautiful women in the world, including Scarlett Johansson, Beyoncé, and supermodel Jourdan Dunnhave embraced sexy chops. Secondly, not every woman was born to have super-long hair. In fact, many women end up looking betterwith acut that better showcases herfeatures.Not to mention, shorter lengths can also make petite girls look taller,and curvier girls slimmer.MORE:21 Celebrity Pixie Cuts That Will Inspire You to GoShorterYou Always Look like You’re Dressed as ‘Fashion’ for HalloweenMeaning: You’re a walking advertisement for trends and/or labels to the point where it looks like you have no point of view of your own.

Lists that tell you all the things you need to throw awaybefore you hit 30 are just a cheap ploy.And they’re untrue! A list like that might say you can’t wearultra low-rise jeans in your ’30s, but hello—look as Isabel Marant! The French designer pretty much exclusively sends super-low jeans down the runway. Sure, they’re styled in a more modern way than the low-riders of the early aughts, butthey’re still low-waisted jeans; so doesn’t it seem silly to rule them out because a list tells you to?Age-appropriate styling is really what you should be following, which means knowing how to take pieces you like and making them look chic without being trendy, comfy without being messy, and vaguely sexy without being overt.40 Fashion Mistakes That are Ruining Your Style | @stylecasterA version of this article was originally published in October 2014.

5 Jewelry Trends For This Season You Won't Want to Miss,"Despite what the opening scene of “The Devil Wears Prada” and its many stiletto-clad aspiring editors may have you believe, fashion loves an ugly shoe. Well, so long as its the right kind of ugly, that is. Clunky, clinical, and vaguely orthopedic-looking footwear has been elevated in recent seasons from fashion taboo to street-style staple—just look at the resurgence of Birkenstocks, Teva’s collaborations with Opening Ceremony and Nasty Gal, and, most recently, the gem-embellished Crocs Christopher Kane sent down the runway at his tenth anniversary show last month at London Fashion Week.MORE: The 50 Most Important Bags from the Spring ’17 RunwaysFor Spring 2017, designers have doubled down on their affection for all forms of maligned shoes: on top of the Crocs, there were flip-flops (Dolce and Gabbana, Alexander Wang, Dries van Noten), water shoes (MSGM, Markus Lupfer), Teva-esque velcro sandals (Emporio Armani, Maison Margiela, Anna Sui),and a second coming of the Chinese mesh slipper (Noon By Noor).Then there were those that presented new silhouettes sure to confuse most of the straight male population, such as Paco Rabanne, whose tube-sock-sandal hybrids my coworker helpfully described as “condoms for your feet,” and Gucci, whose four-inch flatforms were topped withwallpaper-floral ankle-boot uppers.MORE: How to Wear the Biggest Jewelry Trend of Spring ’17 Right NowAnd while sure, ugly-chicmay not be for everyone, these will no doubt find plenty of fans among the more adventurous fashion crowd.Below, get a taste of what we’re all in store for next season with 21 of the most divisive pairs of shoes from the Spring ’17runways. 0Thoughts?1 of 21Gucci Spring 2017Christopher Kane x Crocs Spring 2017Maison Margiela Spring 2017Prada Spring 2017Dolce and Gabbana Spring 2017Paco Rabanne Spring 2017Anna Sui Spring 2017Anya Hindmarch Spring 2017Christopher Kane x Crocs Spring 2017Emporio Armani Spring 2017Fendi Spring 2017Maison Margiela Spring 2017Markus Lupfer Spring 2017MSGM Spring 2017Noon by Noor Spring 2017Paco Rabanne Spring 2017Prada Spring 2017Stella McCartney Spring 2017Toga Spring 2017Undercover Spring 2017Hood By Air Spring 2017Next slideshow starts in 10s11 Quick 60-Second Hairstylesfor Work and School "
Bangles & Big Hoops Are Bringing The '80s Back To Jewelry Trends,"About a month ago, I got it into my head that I absolutely needed a pair of tassel earrings. Maybe it was something I saw on Instagram—actually yeah, it was definitely something I saw on Instagram—but I couldn’t type my search into Google fast enough.Sure enough, the pair I spotted on my feed were by Oscar de la Renta, and came with a $400 price tag—not engagement-ring expensive, sure, but more than I can justify spending on something that I’m embarrassingly prone to losing. So, to Etsy it was, where I scoured page after page of search results—my personal K-hole of choice—to find the perfect affordable dupes.MORE: Your Complete Guide to Plastering Yourself in ’90s Sportswear LogosIn the end, I settled on a vintage pair which, while far from identical, offered the same satisfying swinginess and length as my beloved Oscar earrings—but I was also impressed by the number of sellers offering handmade versions inspired by the classic design. Amid all the Pinterest-perfect nameplate necklaces and steampunk-style watch pendants there’s actually a surprisingly deep trove of modern, cool jewelry on the e-commerce site.So, as a bit of a test, I decided to see if I could do the same with some of the other pricey baubles the fashion industry is currently obsessing over—using Etsy as well as some indie jewelry designers and affordable mass retailers.

"Trust Us, You Don't Want To Sleep On This Jewelry Trend","We all know the transformational power that adding the right jewelry can have on an ensemble.The “less is more” mantra that’s informed accessorizing best practices in years past has become downright dated, thanks to the enduring advent of maximalism (which frankly, has made fashion a lot more fun). That said, maximalismhas complicated things; statement jewelry options are now basically endless, meaning accessory decisions are harder than ever to make.Here at StyleCaster, we’ve taken to simplifying our accessory repertoires a bit. We’ve traded statement necklaces, bracelets and rings for statement earrings this holiday season, and we haven’t looked back.While oversized statement necklaces, French girl-approved coin chokers and chunky cuffs can offer any ensemble an instant upgrade, earrings can complement your outfitand your hairstyleand your makeup look—and even your bone structure, too. Best of all, because statement earrings tend to be more understated than other forms of costume jewelry, they practically invite you to play with texture, embellishment and pattern in a way you might not otherwise think to.The best part? Statement earrings pair just as well with formal wear as they do with plain white tees; they’ll elevate any outfit—whether it’s the LBD you’ve relied on for years, or the just-rolled-out-of-bed look you threw together before brunch this morning.Statement earrings are the must-have accessory that’s as understated as it is maximalist—and as versatile as it is statement-making. And we can’t get our hands on enough. Whether you’re looking to inject a little fun into your tried-and-true earring rotation, or whether you’re a die-hard maximalist looking for her next accessory fix, we’ve got you.Ahead, our favorite statement earrings on the market right now—all of which you could sport to a New Year’s Eve party, and then repurpose for casual wear all 2019 long.Shopbop.Rachel Comey Marquee Earrings, $185 at ShopbopThese translucent, art deco-inspired studs are versatile enough to pair with anything.BaubleBar.Dulcinea Drop Earrings, $42 at BaubleBarThese crystal-embellished drop earrings feature a pop of blush resin detail, giving them atouch of femininity.Farfetch.Oscar de la Renta Tassel Earrings, $395 at FarfetchThese luxe tassel earrings are like your favorite eye-catching red lipstick—but for your ears.Net-a-PorterAlessandra Rich Crystal Clip Earrings, $345 at Net-a-PorterThese crystal-adorned studs give any look a touch of playful charm without giving off childhood playing-dress-up vibes.Mango.Rhinestone Pendant Earrings, $29.99 at MangoThese pendant earrings look extra luxe peeking out from side parted hair style.Free People.Reflection Asymmetric Earrings, $38 at Free PeopleMismatched earrings are one of jewelry’s biggest trends du jour, but they can come across as totally casual if you style them right.Net-a-Porter.Rosantica Strobo Crystal Earrings, $315 at Net-a-Porter’80s-inspired clip-ons will give any look a touch of retro-glam appeal.Nordstrom.Kate Spade New York Pouf Earrings, $68 at NordstromThe marabou trend that’s adorned footwear and handbag key chains for years has finally made its way up to the ears.Matches Fashion.Oscar de la Renta Chain Cluster Beaded Earrings, $594 at Matches FashionBecause nothing holds its own against a beaded dress like a pair of beaded earrings.Revolve.LPA Angel Hoops Earrings, $98 at RevolveEncrusted with eye-catching pearls, these aren’t your everyday hoops.Nordstrom.Kendra Scott Fabiana Statement Earrings, $250 at NordstromThese animated sunburst earrings are sure to add a touch of drama to your look without competing with any of its elements.Free People.Dannijo Rose Earrings, $258 at Free PeopleThese classic gemstone earrings get a romantic upgrade with rose stud detailing.ShopBop.Zimmerman Orchid Statement Earrings, $395 at ShopbopPetal details are always pretty, but these chic drop earrings exude a “cool girl,” appeal thanks to the mismatched lengths and sculptural cut.Nordstrom.Something Navy Rhinestone Chandelier Earrings, $29 at NordstromFor a more modest statement, opt for these chandelier earrings.

"Five 2021 Jewelry Trends To Invest In, From Pendants To Pearls","For the 2016 shopper seeking jewelry with a personal touch, there are monogram pendants, birthstone rings, or bracelets inlaid with gemstones spelling out a codeword of your choice.Or, there’s Swedish designer Cornelia Webb‘s Molded collection, which takes the body’s very bone structure and skin texture as the jumping off point for a range of sculptural, minimal jewelry unlike anything you’ve seen before.While she’s based in Stockholm, Webb was in New York last month to celebrate the brand’s takeover of indie marketplace Tictail‘s Lower East Side boutique. There, the statement chokers and dramatic body chains that she made her name with during the first few years of her decade-long career were displayed alongside her newer, more delicate pieces: druzy drop earrings, rings inlaid with slices of granite, and necklaces molded to mimic the shape of the collarbone. Webb, a former medical student, doesn’t shy away from the human body: she’s used her own to make casts of thumbs, nipples, knuckles, ankles, and more, creating everything from silver-plated pendants to brass-and-marble rings.MORE: How to Wear the Biggest Jewelry Trend of Spring ’17 Right NowThe nipples, strung from chains to be worn around the neck, have been a particular hit—perhaps in part because it’s not immediately obvious what they are. “Women have seen [the nipple pendant] in magazines and been like, ‘What about that hat that you have?’ And we’ve been like, ‘Uhhh, we don’t really have a hat…’ This has been really popular with both men and women.”Not that her customers are prudes by any stretch. “When we started playing around with the metal waxes and casting the nipples, I did full breasts,” she recalls. “We’ve had requests for bespoke services from customers who are like, ‘Can you do my breasts now before I get old?'”Webb does, in fact, offer custom jewelry in addition to the ready-made pieces she sells at Tictail, Net-A-Porter, Harvey Nichols, and elsewhere—but, you do have to visit her in Stockholm, or else catch her at a stop like the one she made in New York for an appointment. There, she’ll make a cast of your chosen body part in wax, then bring it back to her workshop in Bali, Indonesia to hand-make the piece—and while bespoke items are pricier than her typical collections (which, for the most part, retail from around $35 to $250), they’re also guaranteed to be as unique as you are.Even if you can’t snag a custom piece, the personal element is present throughout Webb’s oeuvre—you’ll find a fingerprint or two on almost every piece, whether on the surface of a signet ring or the back clasp of a choker necklace. Not only does this give them a handcrafted feel you don’t get with mass-produced pieces, it also reinforces the human connection, which to the designer may be the most important part.“The more you wear jewelry, the more you’ll love it and the more important it becomes,” she says. Almost, you might say, like second skin.MORE: These Canadian Jewelry Designers Are Killing It Right Now 0Thoughts?1 of 9Cornelia Webb Folded Cuff, $191; at TictailCornelia Webb Wired Stone Body Chain, $191; at TictailCharmed Pinky Necklace, $191; at TictailCornelia Webb Molded Collarbones Cutout Necklace, $269; at TictailCornelia Webb Molded Signet Square Ring, $118; at TictailCornelia Webb Molded Wrist Medium Bracelet, $146; at TictailCornelia Webb Wired Spiral Earring, $107; at TictailMolded Knuckle Ring, $101; at TictailCornelia Webb Slized Ear Cuff, $64; at TictailNext slideshow starts in 10sHere Are the GigiHadid-Designed Boots That Are About to Sell Out "
13 Ways To Start Wearing Spring's Enamel Jewelry Trend Right Now,"If anything, 2018 has exposed our collective affinity for retro revivals. Scrunchies, dad sneakers, year-round sequins and all kinds of other trends from decades past have made a significant comebacks—exiting the (mental and literal) attics we’d stored them in and pervading the sartorial zeitgeist, instead.The latest iteration of this trend? Chunky vintage jewelry—specifically, chunky, vintage-looking gold statement earrings—which offer contemporary maximalists the chance to pay homage to history while accessorizing their outfits in the trendiest, most over-the-top way possible.MORE:17 Faux Fur Jackets That Aren’t Too Extra to WearDailyAs a self-proclaimed maximalist who’s openly lamented not being born in the 1980s (purely for fashion purposes, of course), I’m more than on board with this immoderate movement.The sharp silhouettes of ’80s dresses are hard to beat, but the shoulder pads that come with them can seriously overwhelm an ensemble—that is, until you combine them with a pair of equally eye-catching gold statement earrings. (And some retro Madonna-worthy hair.) (And probably some incredible shoes, too.)Chunky gold earrings can hold their own in even the most head-turning of ensembles. They’re sparkly enough to catch your eye, big enough to warrant your attention and cool enough to demand respect when they do. Even a minimalist could use them to add a pop of intrigue to an otherwise sophisticated-chic look.MORE:Don’t Wait Until New Year’s to Stock up on SequinPiecesSold? You already know I am. Which means it’s time to take this trend from discussion to action, namely in the form of a shopping spree (or two). Ahead, you’ll find gold statement earrings spanning the gamut of price points—from $16 Zara baubles to $995 (genuinely vintage) clip-on Chanel earrings. 0Thoughts?1 of 33Beaded EarringsCostume jewelry so cute you'll be looking for excuses to wear it with everything.Beaded earrings, $20 at ZaraPhoto: Zara.Lako Bukia x Natia Khutsishvili Crocodile EarringsEqual parts kitschy and edgy.Lako Bukia x Natia Khutsishvili crocodile earrings, $245 at FarfetchPhoto: Farfetch.Vintage Engraved EarringsTell people you stole these (incredibly affordable) earrings from your grandma's jewelry box, and they'll definitely believe you.Vintage engraved earrings, $13 at ASOSPhoto: ASOS.Vintage Style Chunky EarringsA little bit subtler—but still appropriately chunky.Vintage style chunky earrings, $10 at ASOSPhoto: ASOS.Round Chain EarringsBecause statement studs are more fun than regular studs, aren't they?Round chain earrings, $18 at ZaraPhoto: Zara.Texture EarringsAsymmetrical without being too much.Texture earrings, $20 at ZaraPhoto: Zara.Beaded Teardrop EarringsThese will pair perfectly with any blouse, sweater or LBD in your closet.Beaded teardrop earrings, $20 at ZaraPhoto: Zara.Aga Hooped Post EarringsOversized drop earrings are the ultimate head-turner.Aga hooped post earrings, $388 at AnthropologiePhoto: Anthropologie.River Island Twist Hoop Drop EarringsThree circles are better than one.River Island twist hoop drop earrings, $16 at ASOSPhoto: ASOS.Desert Mosaic Hooped Post EarringsA bohemian take on an otherwise graphic trend.Desert mosaic hooped post earrings, $218 at AnthropologiePhoto: Anthropologie.BaubleBar Kavos Drop EarringsBecause the shell jewelry trend isn't going anywhere.BaubleBar Kavos drop earrings, $26 at ShopbopPhoto: Shopbop.Chain EarringsPearl is totally on the menu, too.Chain earrings, $20 at ZaraPhoto: Zara.Chain EarringsA little daintier than your average gold statement earrings.

Mejuri's New Enamel Rings Nail 2021's Hottest Jewelry Trend,"Why it is that certain months have multiple birthstones while others are assigned only one is a somewhat complicated question: According to the powers that be (that is, the Jewelers of America), additions are tacked on to their official list in order to “[recognize] the importance of historically significant gemstones and [give] gemstone lovers a choice that suits their preferences.” It also can’t hurt that giving a stone special significance for 1/12th of the population gives it a good shot at a sales boost.August, which (eek!) kicks off today, has three birthstones, depending on whom you consult: peridot, sardonyx, and spinel. Peridot, the most commonly recognized of the three, is a brilliant green stone formed deep beneath the earth’s crust in the upper mantle, similar to diamonds. It’s brought to the earth’s surface through volcanoes or tectonic plate shiftsand is mined in Saint John’s Island off the coast of Egypt, Australia, Myanmar, and locally in Arizona, Hawaii, and New Mexico. Its name derives from the Arabic word for gem, faridat, and it’s said to have healing properties that can rid the wearer of nightmares, increase strength, and ward off anxiety.MORE: Your Definitive Guide to Customizing Your ClothesSardonyx, meanwhile, is a form of onyx known for its reddish-brown hue banded with white. It’s a popular choice for cameos (so fans of vintage jewelry would be wise to look on Etsy and eBay for antique pieces) and was carried into battle by ancient Greeks and Romans in the form of heroic talismans with carved images of Mars and Hercules.Just this year, Jewelers of America announced that spinel, too, would be recognized as an official August birthstone. “Ancient gemstone merchants revered spinel, and it was widely sought after by royalty,” said American Gem Trade Association CEO Doug Hucker. “It was then known as ‘balas ruby.’ It wasn’t until the late 18th century that we developed the technology acumen necessary to distinguish spinel as a separate mineral from ruby.”Despite the ruby association, spinel isn’t only found in red hues: You’ll find black, pink, purple, and orange varieties of the mineral as well, in a wide range of cuts, thanks to its relative hardness compared to other semiprecious stones.MORE: Your Cheat Sheet to Fall’s Top 10 Jewelry TrendsAhead, shop necklaces, rings, bracelets, and more featuring each of the three gems (starting at just $68, too!), and click here for our guide to July’s birthstone, ruby.0Thoughts?1 of 17Peridot Pop Chain Ring, $95; at MejuriOllie Black Spinel & White Topaz Bib Pendant Necklace, $135 (was $225); at Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5thBaby Garnet Rondel and Peridot Necklace, $182; at Wendy Mink JewelryBeam Ring, $270; at Pamela LoveMini Wishbone Earrings with Peridot, $225; at Melissa Joy ManningMarie Helene De Taillac Spinel Safety Pin, $4,245; at FarfetchAntique Victorian 14K Rose Gold Sardonyx Ring, $350; at EtsySydney Evan Black Spinel Lariat Necklace, $1,190; at Bergdorf GoodmanCustomizable Spiral Ring No. 1, $135; at Shahla KarimiAstley Clarke Multicolor Black Spinel Star Biography Pin, $68; at LystDelfina Delettrez Peridot, Topaz, and Yellow Gold Ring, $1,117; at Matches FashionBirthstone Charm Ring, $330; at Ariel GordonBrown Sardonyx and Gold Skull Wrap Bracelet, $295; at Chan LuuBracelet with Peridot and Diamonds in 18K Gold, $1,100; at David YurmanAmedeo Sardonyx Angel Cameo Ring, $1,910; at Neiman MarcusBlack Spinel Rondelle Anklet, $390; at Jacquie AicheBea Cocktail Ring, $500; at Anna SheffieldNext slideshow starts in 10sWhat the Zodiac Has in Storefor You This Month "
"2020's Top Jewelry Trends Are All About Drama, So Layer Up","Bike shorts were one of 2019’s most pervasive—and frankly, most surprising—trends, with plenty of style-savvy influencers endorsing the ’80s look, and styling it with everything from structured blazers and strappy heels to athleisure hoodies and chunky dad sneakers.While denim cut-offs with mid-thigh hems have been warm-weather staples for as long as we can remember, longer-length denim shorts appear to be ousting Daisy Dukes this summer. If Instagram is any indication—and it often is—denim bermudas will reign supreme in the shorts sphere this year, and we’re not totally sure how we feel about it.You may know these knee-length shorts as “mom shorts,” “jorts,” “knee shorts” or—of course—bermudas. But no matter what you call them, they’re quickly emerging as an “ugly” fashion favorite. Trendsetters like Kendall Jenner and Pernille Teisbaek have already publicly endorsed the trend, and many of your favorite retailers have stocked up on denim bermudas in droves. Given the rise in surf-inspired trends, like shell jewelry and tie-dye tees, it’s really no surprise beachy bermudas would rise to popularity in tandem. Of course, as is the case with now-ubiquitous bike shorts, you can elevate your bermuda shorts with the addition of heels and blazers—just as easily as you can pair them with your favorite band tee, baseball cap and worn-in sneakers.Despite these tell-tale signs, if you’re still slightly skeptical of this intimidating style, we don’t blame you. While bermudas exude a certain nostalgic charm, the hemline can be hard for anyone who isn’t Gisele Bündchen. If you’re intrigued by the trend, but afraid to jump straight on the bermuda bandwagon, opting for a slightly looser fit with a rigid denim design could be a safe place to start—and darker indigo and black washes offer an even more accessible way into the trend.Shopbop.1.

"This Spring, Shell Pendants Might Just Replace Last Year’s Coin Jewelry Obsession","Always a little wilder, weirder, andmore unexpected than its New York and European counterparts, London Fashion Week is the place to look for underground trends that the rest of us will eventually catch onto. With young designers straight out of Central Saint Martins (a breeding ground for talent likeRiccardo Tisci,Stella McCartney, and the lateAlexander McQueen) showing alongside international powerhouses like Burberry and Topshop, the energy is such that you’d almost forget it was only five days long.A few collections stood out as especially memorable this season: J.W. Anderson’s perfectly-accessorized, time-traveling tour de force, Preen’s sequin-and-ruffle-clad cool-girl coven, and Christopher Kane’s glorious mishmash of memories at his 10th anniversary show. Of course, a few trends emerged throughout the week, too. Below, see the five you need to know for Spring ’17.MORE: How to Wear the Biggest Jewelry Trend of Spring ’17 Right NowMother of Pearl; Ashley Williams; Topshop Unique’80sOh yes: they’re back. The decade of Blondie, big hair, and bigger shoulder pads was embraced with gusto this season by brands beloved by London’s It-girl population. At Ashley Williams, where Alexa Chung and Pixie Geldof sat front row, taffeta party dresses payed homage to teenage nostalgia, while at Mother of Pearl,ruching and ruffled hems gave ultra-short minis a Dynasty-era vibe. Topshop managed to make a few of the decade’strickier trends look surprisingly wearable, including crimped hair (softness is key), loud animal prints (bring on the zebra), and sexpot-style vinyl skirts.Mulberry; J.W. Anderson; Versus VersaceArmy SurplusFashion never seems to tire of taking inspiration from military garb, and for spring, designersacross the pond sent out a call to armson the runway withprecisiontailoring, heavy hardware, and plenty of khaki and green. At Versus Versace, Donatella’s battalion wore cropped bomber jackets paired with buckled suede skinny pants and aviator goggles, while J.W. Anderson’s Henry VIII jackets and patchwork khaki dresses had a distinct surplus feel. Both designers also sent models out in lace-up canvas combat boots (with heels, mind you—in case you were concerned that anyone was actually about to go into battle here).House of Holland; Christopher Kane; Temperley LondonPiled-On PrintsMore is more is more in London—all the way from embellished Crocs (thanks for that, Christopher Kane) to gingham-floral-mesh layered dresses (you do you, Henry Holland). One great thing about the return of maximalism? It’s surprisinglyeasy to recreate at home—all you need is your most daring prints and a whole lot of confidence. To test the waters, find pieces that fall within the same color family, à la Temperley’s fuchsia-spotted leopard top and embroidered vest.Molly Goddard; Bora Aksu; Simone RochaSheer VolumeBigger also proved better when it came to the scale of dresses; layers and layers of tulle and chiffon formed voluminous confections across the city. Molly Goddard, who’s made the tutu in all forms her calling card, sent out asymmetric, neon, and empire-waist styles this season, but the pièce de résistance was the delightfully frilly dove-gray version pictured above. At Bora Aksu, a vivid pinknumber with a ruffled, embellished neckline presented an appealingly out-there evening option, while Simone Rocha toned down the girlishness with polished riding boots and an off-kilter trench coat—definitely the easiest look of the three to imitate at home.Peter Pilotto; Marques ‘ Almeida; Preen by Thornton BregazziStatement SleevesShoulders have been the focal point of, oh, just about everyfashion girl’s go-to outfitfor Summer ’16, but come spring, designers are turning their attention a little lower, adding rows of ruffles, billowing volume, and pops of printto the lowly sleeve. Peter Pilotto did the near-impossible and offered a new take on the now-ubiquitous off-the-shoulder silhouette, giving a tie-front bandeau a pair of cuffed balloon sleeves. The ruffle trend also got an update at Preen, where they imparted extra witchy vibes to a trim polo shirt (in case the pentagram logo didn’t get the point across clearly enough). Finally, leg o’ mutton sleeves were a trend unto themselves this week (despite their unfortunate name); our favorites were Marques ‘ Almeida’s versions, which came in colorful sheer chiffon and cotton-candy pink cotton.MORE: The Top 10 Trends from New York Fashion Week"
Kitschy Fruit Jewelry Is All Over Instagram & I'm Fully Embracing It,"A few years ago, if you wanted to buy a ripped-from-the-runway trend—say, a banana-printed skirt inspired by Prada’s Spring 2011 collection—you basically had two options: one, go straight to the source and shell out upwards ofseveral hundred dollars, or wait for Zara,Topshop, or H&M to come up with their own interpretation, which you’d then surely see others wearing within the week.Today, however, a new wave of online retailers iscarving out a space for to-the-minute fashion produced quickly, merchandised savvily, and priced at an affordable, though not dirt-cheap, price point. One of the names at the forefront of the so-called “indie fast fashion”movement is Genuine People, a two-year-old e-commerce site based out of Shanghai and San Francisco, founded by husband-and-wife duoSharona Cohen and Nave Avimor. Considering the relative newness of the operation (they’ve been building the business since 2014, but only officially launched to the press this past June), they’ve already made a splash among the fashion crowd, with editors, bloggers, and stylists snapping up their reasonably-priced, on-trend pieces soon after they hit the site.One of the keys to their early success? Refreshing the product selection almost daily, so that customers canclick on the “New Arrivals” tab and see a selection of metallic midi skirts and satin bombers one day and pin-stripe jumpsuits and velvet slip dresses the next. The hunger forperennial freshness is something the couplehad in mind from the start. When theymoved to China from Tel Aviv in 2010 and Cohen, then in her early twenties,began working in fashion production and product development, one of the first things she noticed wasthe speed at which trends took hold on the streets.“I guess it’s part of the culture—everything here is emerging and happeningat such afast pace, people reallywant the runway looks ASAP,” she says. Unlike, say, Zara, Genuine People doesn’t design or manufacture merchandise in-house, but rather Cohen sources productat trade shows from factories, independent designers, and other standalone vendors on regular trips toKorea, China, Singapore, and Japan. In that way, she says, the site is more like a Shopbop or a Revolve than a mass retailer like H&M, though it takes a savvy eye to realize which pieces come from the same manufacturer, since they do away with brand names and price points tend to be fairly uniform across the board, with most pieces coming in around the$100-200 mark.MORE: How to Wear the Biggest Jewelry Trend of Spring ’17 Right NowThe only telltale sign is the slight hodgepodge of photography on the site—some pieces are shoton-model, lookbook style, while others areshot flat or on a hanger. The scale of the vendors varies dramatically, however, says Cohen, which is one reason she resists the “fast fashion” label.“The things that we buy, especially from these young designers, they make three pieces of each item … and they sew that themselves in their own studio, so how can that be fast fashion? But on the other hand, when you go to trade shows and you buy silky bomber jackets and their prices are relatively low—$50, $60—yeah, I assume a factory made thousands of units.”The prices on Genuine People are also decidedly higher than what you’ll find at Forever 21or even Mango—one oversizedleather jacket, for instance, costs $739—which is reflective of higher quality materials, as well as the factthatChina isn’t the hotbed of cheap manufacturing that it once was. (Today,retailers that traffic in $20 jeanshave moved production to places like Bangladesh and Cambodia, as recent tragedieslike Rana Plazahave brought to the fore.) And while there are definite parallels with the fast-fashion business model—including pieces thatseem precariously close to knockoff territory, like a pair ofslip-onloafersthat bear more than a passing resemblance to the hit Gucci style, and severalfaux-leather handbagsthat take liberal inspiration from Mansur Gavriel’s much-copied repertoire—ultimately, Cohen says they hope to fill a niche more in line with brands likeEverlane or Need Supply Co., but for a younger, more trend-attuned customer.From a team of two—Cohen handling merchandising and Avimore building the website from the ground up—they’ve grown to a team of 20 split between San Francisco and Shanghai. Eventually, she says, they’d like to curate a wider selection of lifestyle goods—housewares, books, music—aimed at their demographic sweet spot, which so far has been style-consciousprofessionalsin their 20s to early 30s, about 90 percent of whom are US-based. This also, probably not coincidentally, describes Cohen herself: “I feel our customers are like me and my husband—people who can’t necessarilyafford luxury brands, butwe’re all young creative professionals and we just want good stuff. We have high standards andwe like to travel and we like to wear nice clothes … and if you can buy a cashmere maxi jacket for less than $200, then why not?”It’s still early days for the company—so Zara founder Amancio Ortega and his $77 billion fortune probably doesn’t haveanything toworry about quite yet—but for shoppers, it’s another opportunity to snap up wallet- (and Instagram-) friendly pieces your friends don’t already own.MORE: The Top 10 Trends from New York Fashion Week Spring 2017Below, shop 15 of our favorite pieces from Genuine People right now.0Thoughts?1 of 15High-Neck Pullover Top, $149; at Genuine PeopleLong-Sleeve Top and Bell Bottom Pant, $199 (was $249); at Genuine PeopleFaux Leather Pointed Sandals, $150; at Genuine PeopleHigh-Waist Wide-Leg Pants, $180; at Genuine PeopleWhite Collar Blouse, $76 (was $94); at Genuine PeopleHigh-Waist Pleated Midi Skirt, $90 (was $119); at Genuine PeopleOversized Sweater, $114; at Genuine PeopleBlack Leather Mule Sandals, $129; at Genuine PeopleCrop Denim Jacket, $135; at Genuine PeopleSilky Embroidered Koi Fish Bomber Jacket, $77 (was $94); at Genuine PeopleVelvet Slip Dress, $169; at Genuine PeopleOversized Chained Pullover Dress, $129; at Genuine PeopleRetro Plaid Shorts and Top Bodysuit, $279; at Genuine PeopleVelvet Pajamas Suit, $260; at Genuine PeopleBow Back Tie Top, $54 (was $72); at Genuine PeopleNext slideshow starts in 10sThe 35 Best Beauty Momentsfrom ‘90s (and Early ‘00s) TV Shows "
Hailey Bieber's Gold Body Chain Makes Her Bikini Look Even Hotter,"Whether you’re actually planning to get engaged soon or not, we’re all guilty of searching for beautiful engagement rings for when that time in our lives comes. Those who have skimmed the pages of Pinterest will know, too, that there areso many different types of engagement rings out there—How do you know what you want? Trends come and go, sure, but having a look at the fall engagement ring trends can give you some insight into what’s popular now and what you might want to boast on that ring finger of yours in the future. To get the scoop on these trends, StyleCaster talked to experts from James Allen, Shane Co., Edward Avedis and Lauren Addison Jewelry about what engagement ring trends you can expect to see for fall.Of course, there are plenty of things that influence these trends. “In a time where social media is the prime focus of millennials, people are looking to celebrities and influencers as inspiration for different ring styles, says an expert from James Allen. “A good example of this would be Meghan Markle. As soon as a picture of her sparkler was released to the public, we saw a shift to three-stone engagement rings.” So, be sure to pay attention to your favorite celebrities who get engaged, because there’s a good chance their ring style is listed below.1. Vintage Halo“Historically, one of the primary reasons brides have leaned towards a halo for their engagement ring is to create a larger, more sparkly look for their diamond,” says Shane Co. VP of Merchandise Alicia Davis. “This Fall, as the personalization trend continues, brides are looking for more unique halos to stand out amongst their friends. The vintage trend allows them to still have that glamorous ring, but with a more unique feel to it.”Vintage Diamond Halo Engagement Ring$1850Buy NowVintage Halo Diamond Engagement Ring$985Buy NowTwo-Tone Vintage Halo Engagement Ring$1585Buy Now2. Pavé Bands“While pavé has always been one of the most popular settings, we see this style continuing to grow in popularity,” a representative from James Allen tells us. “Pavé​ will continue being the go-to setting throughout Fall 2019 and even into early 2020 for the person that wants a little extra sparkle.”Petite Pave Engagement Ring$950Buy NowCushion Shaped Diamond Ring at Lauren Addison JewelryRose Gold Twisted Pave Kite$1300Buy Now3. Colored Center Stones“Fall 2019 will be a season of color,” says Alicia Davis, VP of Merchandise for Shane Co. “Many brides are opting out of a traditional diamond for their engagement rings and choosing a colored stone that speaks to their personality and style. Sapphires are the top choice second to diamonds because they come in every color of the rainbow and all of the same shapes as diamonds.” Avedis Guerboian of Edward Avedis Jewelry agrees: “For fall 2019, color is in. This includes fancy yellow, grey, or green diamonds. Clients want to stand out with simple designs to showcase the beauty of these gems.”Halo Baguette and Round Diamond…$2225Buy NowCaroline Engagement Ring$3990Buy NowChristina de Saphir$1690Buy Now4. Ovals“Ovals are trending in a big way for brides in 2019,” says Lauren Addison of Lauren Addison Jewelry. “Possessing a similar fire and brilliance of a brilliant-cut, the oval is an ideal choice for the bride who wants the sparkle of a round diamond with the desired elongated shape that the oval provides. Whether you choose to go with a classic setting or something a bit more contemporary, the versatility of the oval makes it a popular choice for today’s bride.”         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by L A U R E N   A D D I S O N (@laurenaddisonjewelry)Oval-Shaped Diamond Ring at Lauren Addison Jewelry (bespoke)Oval Center Halo Engagement Ring$1650Buy NowBrienne Engagement Ring$1290Buy Now5. Elongated Diamond Shapes“2019 has easily become the year of bigger is better,” says VP of Merchandise for Shane Co., Alicia Davis. “And brides have discovered that one way to get a bigger look is by choosing an elongated diamond shape that naturally looks larger than the others.

Anklets Are Summer 2019's Coolest Jewelry Trend,"Photo: Courtesy of BaubleBarIt’s pretty much a fact that Olivia Palermo is the queen of accessorizing (remember when she “worked” in the accessories department of Elle on “The City”?), and now the fashionstar is putting her talents to good use by designing a costume jewelry collection for BaubleBar.While this may not be her first accessories collaboration—she’s helped create bib necklaces for Roberta Freymann, sunglasses for Westward Leaning and shoes for Aquazzura—it’s by far the most democratic, with everything in the 27-piece collection retailing for under $100.Photo: Courtesy of BaubleBarSince Palermo is a huge vintage shopper, many of the piecesreference other eras—but with a modern spin. Take, for instance, a pair of ear jackets ($36) that get the Art Deco treatment or an Art Nouveau-esque vine ring ($58) that sprawls several digits for a multi-finger effect. Another major current jewelry trend she tackles: brooches ($34–$42), which were rampant on the Fall 2015 runways and are offered here in sparkling clusters.The bulk of the collection is comprised of collar necklaces dripping with crystal quartz ($68), oversize insects ($48–$68) and mirrored gold ($48), plus a handful of chunky, sculptural cuffs ($38–$58). Make no mistake, these items are designed to make a statement.Photo: Courtesy of BaubleBarIf you’re stumped on how to pull off the decorative pins without looking like a grandma, click on over to BaubleBar’s site, where Palermo demonstrates the best way to wear them (and other pieces from her collection)—flawlessly, of course."
"So Everyone Is Obsessed With Pearls Now, Right?","Remember when you finally got your ears pierced in middle school only to find out that double piercings were suddenly the trend? And when you got double piercings, you found that cartilage piercings were the trend? And when you refused to get cartilage piercings for decades and instead spent a small fortune on dainty ear cuffs to fake the look, some mean trendsetters decided to switch the trend again? Yup, it’s happening. Folks, meet helix tattoos, the new trend in ear “jewelry,” which is less jewelry and more a-real-tattoo-curved-around-your-ear.MORE: 15 Best Skin Serums to Try For a Clear, Even-Toned ComplexionHelix tattoos are basically just tiny tattoos that curve up around the edge (or the helix) of your ear, and according to Yahoo Style, the trend has blown up thanks to Seoul-based tattoo artist Zihee, whose Instagram (which has 90k followers) is filled with insanely bright and nature-filled tattoos. There’s no true rhyme or reason to the trend—some people, like Cara Delvingne, have helix-like tattoos on their cartilage—while others are tattooing their lobes in lieu of earrings.We have yet to test out this very permanent trend for ourselves, but it’s safe to assume that there’s some pain involved with tattooing your very hard, non-fleshy ear. Still, if you’re opposed to punching holes in your ears, may we suggest this more-colorful alternative?

Why Jewelry Is the Best Staple Piece to Pass Down Generations,"Photo:THPSHOPIf you’re into all things sparkly, you’ve probably noticed a growing number of fashion bloggers launching their own jewelry lines.It seems that jewelry designis the coveted new career amongfashion bloggers and social media stars looking to capitalize on their huge followings.FashionToast blogger Rumi Neelypaved the way, collaboratingwith Dannijo in 2010 on a limited-edition six-piece line of jewelry. Then came Man Repeller’s Leandra Medine with a costume jewelry collection in 2012, again with Dannijo. This year,Annabelle Fleur from Viva Luxuryand YouTube sensationAmelia Lianahave both released collaborationswith CanadianbrandMejuri. It feels like every other fashion blogger is moonlighting as an accessories designer—andtheir lines are fast becoming some of our favorites.Most notable perhaps though is THPSHOP, the new jewelry brand byCanadian cool girlVanessa Hong from Haute Pursuit.A natural extension of her elevated yet edgy style, it doesn’t take long for Vanessadesign a new collection—”my notebook’s always packedwith ideas,” she explained—and she’sfocused onbuilding a strong brand by sticking to a minimalist theme. “I always base collections on the recurring theme of minimalism, usingclean lines and easy shapes. A lot of what we do is very subtle,” she said.Photo:THPSHOPIf you too have dabbled with the idea of creating a jewelry brand, take some advice from Vanessa. She keepsher line of delicate jewelry affordable by manufacturing offshore inBeijing, China, where she has an office and manufacturer dedicated to supporting her U.S. office. “We have a small office in Beijing that acts as an extension of our West Coast office. I have a very talented small team that spearheads things like sourcing and manufacturing.”When it comes to promoting her brand, she’s particularly savvy. Anyone who follows Vanessa knows the uber bloggers’sclever when it comes to leveraging her own 378,000-strong Instagram following to boost her jewelry label—most of her posts reference THPSHOP in some way, and she’s rarely photographed without wearing a piece. So far, it’s a strategy that seems to be working: THPSHOP’s own Instagram account has close to 40,000 followers, and the line has expanded to include earrings, cuffs, rings and necklaces that capture Vanessa’sedgy but elegant personal style.“The range is filled with delicate pieces that you can layer or wear alone—subtle, but with impact. More importantly, the line is very affordable with the majority of items under $75 dollars,” Vanessa told us.And when it comes tothe jewelry trend she’s obsessing over right now, Vanessa can’t get enough of hoop earrings. ”I’m all about hoops right now,” she told us. “I used to wear them a lot in high school, but I think their newest incarnation is a lot cleaner and high fashion. Hermès makes a spectacular ‘needle’ hoop that has been on my wish list. You will also see some in our upcoming collection.”Viva Luxury x MejuriPhoto: Viva LuxuryViva Luxury’s Annabelle Fleur is taking a similar approach, recently releasing ajewelry line with Mejuri. Like Vanessa’s label, her collection is elegant and edgy, and mostly sticks to under$200 price tags. “When Mejuri and I started thinking about this collection we really wanted to create something that is both elegant and classic yet edgy and modern, which is why we chose to go with classically elegant pearls and clean, geometric settings,” Annabelle explained.So whenyou’re next in the market for jewelry, grab your phonefirst.

Kylie Jenner Is Fielding Criticism Over Baby Girl Stormi's Personalized Hoop Earrings,"You’ve slipped on your favorite dress, slid on a pair of kitten heels, and slicked your hair back into the perfect bun. You’re almost ready to walk out the door but your look is missing one major thing: details. Whether you identify with the “less is more” or “more is more” school of thought regarding fashion, both parties can agree that the best outfits include some kind of accessory. Summer’s jewelry trends have been solidified (and spoiler alert: they’ll easily last through the fall) and they’re just what you need to add that extra dazzling detail to your outfit.One of my favorite things about jewelry trends is that they aren’t as volatile as fashion trends. High-quality jewelry usually has sentimental value and also often comes with a higher price tag. This means that jewelry trends stick around for a more extended period of time because people aren’t looking to part ways with their favorite pieces.I take the personal approach of investing in my everyday staples like a simple gold chain, studs, or name initial ring and then letting myself have fun with less expensive costume jewelry. I also think finding inspiration from your friends and family is helpful. For example, my mom has a gold coin jewelry set that she’s worn throughout the last 20 years. The set makes a statement and has never gone out of style—I always admire the look of it when she wears it so I’d be willing to invest in a similar piece!The top jewelry trends this summer fall into the investment and trend categories. For example, the chain link necklaces, sleek silver hoops, and floral jewelry all have incredible longevity. If they tire out at any point, you know they’ll always eventually come back. On the trendier end, we have charm bracelets and initial necklaces. Both of these trends are meant to be customized which makes them great gift options—fashion is always more fun when you can share it with a friend.iMaxTree.1. FloralsFlorals are often associated with summer dresses or the tablescape at a dinner party, but the trend is in full bloom in the accessories sphere. Floral earrings are especially having a moment and are a fun twist on the whimsical look of tucking a flower behind your ear. The style works with statement earrings, flower-encrusted hoops or bracelet charms.iMaxTree.2. Sleek Silver HoopsOk if you haven’t caught on by now, all the hot girls and guys are wearing silver hoops. Big or small, stacked or single, silver hoops are still the coolest thing you can put in your ears (sorry Airpods). Feel free to mix metals and add a combination of silver and gold to your ear stack.iMaxTree.3. Chain Link NecklacesYou’re going to want to link up with this jewelry trend—literally. Chain link necklaces are the perfect everyday accessory and can be customized to your lifestyle. For example, I wear two delicate link chain necklaces every day that add subtle detail to my outfitsandI don’t have to take them on and off to sleep, shower, etc. You can choose how heavy you want the metal to be, how many you want to layer and if you want to add charms to your stack.iMaxTree.4. Initial JewelryJewelry is so personal and the initial and name jewelry trend proves it! Wearing a customizable name necklace, initial ring or both is a fun way to make a “this is me!” statement. Initial jewelry can also be a meaningful way to show your connection to someone else—whether it’s your significant other, parent or child’s initials, adding a piece to your collection will keep them close to you all day.Getty Images.5. Charm BraceletsCharm bracelets are back and better than ever. Tap into early 2000’s nostalgia with a decked-out charm bracelet on your wrist. Charms are a fun way to show off your niche interests, give your friend a meaningful gift, celebrate a memory or create a #twinning moment. "
Hailey Bieber's Go-To Choker Is More Than 50% Off & We're Shocked It Hasn't Sold Out Yet," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.It’s easy to get caught up in revamping your wardrobe to fit the season’s latest trends. But between the cut-outs, faux fur coats, low-rise jeans, and dip-dye, the fashion trends may begin to seem overwhelming when the outfit options become endless. When you’re standing in the dressing room of Zara trying to determine which item to purchase, let me remind you that jewelry is often what makes and completes an outfit. So keep your fashion simple, grab your favorite black sweater or white button-down and shift your energy to focus on the jewelry trends for 2023. From simple silver hoops to bold bangles, there’s a jewelry trend to add a little extra flair to any look.While clothing always tells a story, jewelry is considered to be more personal. You may already have a signature piece that you wear every day or something with deep sentimental value. Oftentimes, these personally valuable pieces lean on the side of individual taste more than a trend, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do both. The best part of jewelry? Layers, stacks and statements pieces. The hardest part is picking which pieces to pair together!I interviewed jewelry designer and curator, Stephanie Gottlieb, for an expert opinion on how to play into 2023’s biggest jewelry moments and the key to finding a balance between trendy and timeless.First and foremost, if you’re looking to invest in your personal jewelry collection, it’s best to prioritize purchasing pieces that will maintain quality and value.“I always recommend for a new buyer to start with the classics like diamond studs, a tennis bracelet, or a diamond stack bands and then if you’re wanting to introduce the trendy pieces do that after you’ve already built the wardrobe of the staples,” Gottlieb advises. But when it comes to trendy pieces, Gottlieb says the opposite, “Buy costume to start and upgrade over time as the budget allows. You can sprinkle in less expensive fashion-forward trendy pieces.”Tom Ford; iMaxTree.Her advice seems simple enough—invest in quality, play with quantity! Luckily, 2023’s jewelry trends give you the opportunity to do a bit of both. Classic silver and gold pieces aren’t going anywhere—if anything, they’re getting more popular. If you’ve already built a collection of Hailey Bieber-inspired gold hoops (I sure know I have), consider mixing in some silver metal and vice versa. Don’t be afraid to upgrade your classic metals but simply goingbigger.According to Gottlieb, “We’re going to see a big comeback of the ‘80s and still some of the ‘90s. Think lots of chunky gold jewelry, big hoops and geometric shapes.” Based on the Spring/Summer ‘23 runway shows, Gottlieb is spot on.Keep reading for the five biggest jewelry trends expected to shine throughout 2023 (hey, it’s never too early to start wearing them!).Tory Burch; Jonathan Simkhai, iMaxTree.Totally CuffedA silver or gold cuff is the perfect example of a way to make a subtle statement with just one piece. Cuff bracelets are proving themselves to be the easiest way to elevate any look. The silhouette is often just a thick, arched curve but the impact is big! For starters, cuffs are usually adjustable which means you can wear them in multiple ways. If you prefer a classic look, add a cuff (or two) around your wrist to shine under the sleeve of your shirt or sweater. To make the trend more interesting, slip the cuff up your forearm like the models wore at Missoni, or opt for a wrap-around cuff as seen on the models at Tory Burch.Courtesy of Banana Republic.Hammered Cuff BraceletThis silver cuff has a wave structure to it which will help reflect light and make it super eye-catching. Plus, it’s only $30 so it’s a great way to try out to trend without feeling handcuffed to it.

Oversized silver statement hoops were a staple on the spring/summer ’23 runway and the second I saw Bella Hadid wear them during the Jil Sander show, I was sold. I’m putting my bets in now that she repeats the silver hoops for a street-style moment. Oversized silver hoops are another ’80s trend but they look incredibly modern when paired with 2023’s runway trends. For everyday wear, consider downsizing the hoop size (your ears will thank you) and leave the big guys for special occasions.Courtesy of Stephanie Gottlieb.35mm Tube Hoop EarringsIf you plan on wearing a pair of earrings on a daily basis, it’s definitely worth investing in a pair that won’t irritate your ears or tarnish.

Take notes from Blumarine, the totally Y2 K-inspired brand, and add a charm to a beaded strand, or get inspired by Coach’s quirky decision to add unusual objects to a long strand like a sports whistle.

"The Cutest Ways To Say 'I'm Vaxxed, Not Anti-Mask' This Summer"," If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.I’m very lucky because my mom is a total fashion icon. When we go shopping together, we almost always leave with matching fashion finds. For this reason, the mother-daughter matching jewelry trend is perfect.I’ve been stealing her clothes, bags and jewelry for as long as I can remember and incorporating them into my own wardrobe. I even got caught trying to bring some of her items to college with me (my mission was unsuccessful). I love the idea of coordinating jewelry because it’s a way to bring everyday sentimental value to both of our looks. It also saves us from being too matchy-matchy and doubles our options (because we obviously still swap pieces).Coordinating jewelry, especially in a mother-daughter sense, doesn’t need to feel like a gimmick. Don’t get me wrong, I was a huge fan of matching friendship bracelets and half-heart necklaces as a kid but I want my grown-up jewelry to feel a little more elevated.Now I look for easy ways to build continuity between our collections. One way this can be done is by focusing on a motif, like the stars or the moon, and finding pieces within that theme. I also love the idea of choosing a stone or jewel and finding jewelry that features the same element.AP Images.Zoë Kravitz and her mom Lisa Bonet do an incredible job of coordinating jewelry in a way that still speaks to their individual personal styles. Kravitz’s gold earrings and body chain compliment Bonet’s bird brooch on her collar and gold hoops.A lot of jewelry brands also have signature styles that they incorporate throughout most of their pieces. By shopping for jewelry from the same brand, there’s a good chance that the design elements will be consistent throughout—you can take a brand’s signature style and make it one you and your mom are known for wearing.AP Images.If being subtle isn’t your thing, take a page out of Kris and Khloe Kardashian’s book and go bold. The Kardashian duo not only wore bright diamond earrings, but coordinated their twisted glitter dresses. This is a fun way to make sure everyone is aware of family ties at functions.Whether you’re pairing earrings and bracelets or rings and necklaces, mother-daughter jewelry is so sweet and sentimental. Mother’s Day is also quickly approaching so this is a great way to get your mom and yourself (for the sake of the trend of course) something special.Keep reading for my favorite coordinating picks.A Pearl PairPerhaps the most classic way to coordinate with your mom is by wearing complementary sets of pearls. Pearl jewelry is a staple of sophisticated style but can also allude to the more carefree fashion of the 1920s. Pearls are currently having a modern resurgence and are being incorporated into heavy chain necklaces, huggie earrings or other gem clusters. This means that even if you are a die-hard Y2K grunge-girl and your mom prefers a classic strand, you can still coordinate jewelry and have a meaningful connection.To The Moon & BackIf you’re into astrology or just love spending a long night under the stars, moon and star-themed jewelry is a great way to connect with your mom and the great unknown. Stars are super on-trend for jewelry right now so it’s easy to find celestial gems to wear. One of you can sport a crescent moon necklace while the other wears sparkly star earring studs (or vice versa) to stick with the theme. If you want to get multiple siblings in on the look, a moon and star charm bracelet is also a fun option for everyone to wear.Diamonds Are Your Mom’s Best FriendYou don’t have to have an heirloom engagement ring to connect to your family with diamonds. Diamonds come in all shapes and sizes which makes them easy to personalize and fun to mix and match. A matching pair of small diamond studs are great for everyday wear and will be a subtle daily reminder of your mom. Having different pieces in the same shape or setting is another way to have a subtle #twinning moment. Diamonds are also available in moissanite and lab-grown alternatives so you don’t have to break the bank to participate. "

Because of my long-time commitment to jewelry I end up gravitating towards timeless pieces but recently, the spring jewelry trends for 2022 have caught my eye.Suddenly, I’m interested in switching out my classic gold jewelry for understated silver. Even better, I’ll wear them both at once and be the girl that rocks mixed metals. For special occasions, I’m planning on experimenting with floral texture and pops of color.

Your Love of All Things Tropical Can Officially Extend into the Jewelry Sphere,"I’m the type of gal who sticks to a few gold earrings or a simple gold chain and calls it a day, so I never thought I would be one to gravitate toward colorful jewelry. But if 2021 has taught me anything so far, it’s that I should probably branch out and try new things, and my newfound color obsession is making it that easy. Case in point: I have (somehow) fallen head over heels for the enamel jewelry trendthat has been taking over my social media feeds. Luckily for me, these rainbow-brite pieces don’t seem to be going away anytime soon.It all started when I spotted a pair of Mejuri’s enamel hoops while aimlessly browsing the web the other night and instantly fell in love. I thought it was simply because I was tired, so I shut my laptop and tried to forget about them—but I couldn’t. Turns out, that was just the beginning of my enamel jewelry spiral. Now, I’ve found tons of different options at literally every price point imaginable, and they’re all sitting in my cart waiting for me to pull the proverbial trigger and place a slew of orders.So, I’ve rounded up 13 of my favorite pieces of enamel jewelry to share with you, in hopes that I won’t be the only one impulse-shopping.

These Etsy Valentine's Day Gifts Put Chocolates & Flowers To Shame,"Our opportunities to experiment with style took a massive hit over the last year, but the accessories we chose to wear while working from home were our saving grace. I seriously miss the days prior to then where I could put on “real” pants and deck myself out in every blingy earring, bracelet and necklace in my jewelry box. Now that we’re starting to go out and about again, hopefully, Mejuri’s brand-new enamel rings can help me get a handle on some of 2021’s biggest jewelry trends.I once thought colorful jewelry was a thing of the past. Sure, I used to stack on bright bangles and plastic rings when I played dress-up as a kid, but I’ve opted for wearing more understated pieces made from gold or silver since becoming a real adult. That said, it looks like Mejuri is officially making colors cool again with their new selection of enamel pieces, and I’m surprisingly here for it. The collection includes two ring styles and a pair of hoop earrings that come in shades of green, brown and blue. If you’re a true magpie at heart, don’t fret—these enamel pieces are adorned with a single shiny stone in the center for an added blingy bonus.All trends really do end up coming back around. Similar to the pearl jewelry craze that took over my Instagram feed last month and revived the look I once considered stuffy and outdated, enamel is being completely reinvented in 2021. In Mejuri’s collection, the colors are more understated rather than bold or intense, so they’ll play well with your favorite metallic pieces and chunky gold chains. Just like everything else Mejuri sells, these rings are just bold enough to make a statement.Add a few of these rings into your collection for a playful pop of color this season.

We're Living For All The Statement Necklaces On The Oscars Red Carpet,"While some look to the runways to see what all the models are wearing on their bodies, I’m more interested in what they’ve got on their ears. And on their fingers, and around their necks—do you see where I’m going with this? Earrings, rings and necklaces are the keys to my heart, and lucky for me, all the 2020 jewelry trends are full-on obsession-worthy.Designers like Christian Siriano made a case for chunky, punk-inspired chains, while others, like Ulla Johnson and Zimmermann, showed off more playful looks like fun mismatched earrings and charm necklaces, respectively. There’s no shortage of statement jewelry calling my name this season, and I can’t wait to pair all these trends with cozy fall and winter ensembles.One of the best parts about jewelry is that it has the ability to elevate any outfit. Wearing a white tee and jeans? Add a chunky gold chain necklace or some fun dangly earrings and suddenly it’s a whole lewk. Unsure of how to wear your favorite LBD this season? Just add some statement jewelry (in either colorful hues or classics like gold and silver) and spice things up a bit.

Are Sunglasses Lanyards...Cool Now?,"Sure, diamond rings and classic pendant necklace—from lockets to shell-adorned chokers, and everything in between— is definitely jewelry staples that every accessory lover should own at least one of in their personal collection, but if you’re looking to add a bit of either edge of elegance to your look, embellishing your wrist with statement arm candy is your best bet for looking subtle yet adding a little something extra to help refine your overall look.

Hoop Earrings So Truly Massive You Could Probably Fit Your Head Through Them,"It’s hardly a stretch to make the argument that last year’s biggest overarching jewelry trend was the Instagram-famous coin necklace, endorsed by countless influencers, style editors and street style stars alike. It makes sense that this classic jewelry style went remarkably viral, as coin necklaces offer the utmost versatility, thanks to their infinitely stackable appeal (the coin and nameplate duo have remained a popular layering combo)—punctuated, of course, by their inherently vintage charm. This spring, though, there’s a new influencer-approved jewelry trend on the block: seashell jewelry.Not only are gilded seashell-shaped designs cropping up as adornments on necklaces, but the resort-ready motif is also a dominant embellishment for rings, statement earrings and hair accessories this season. Even ’90s-era puka shells are coming back to life in modernized jewelry styles that—don’t worry—aren’t exact replicas of the throwback styles beloved by teenage surfers of decades’ past.Before you begin to cringe at this beachy trend’s somewhat startling resurrection, know that today’s puka-imbued jewelry has been revised with polished updates that prevent the designs from looking like an artifact of ’90s ska culture—or some overpriced souvenir purchased at the hotel gift shop during your childhood family vacation. And, if you still need further proof that the unlikely style’s return to fashion is, in fact, a thing, look to none other than Gigi Hadid, who was spotted sporting a puka choker during Paris Fashion Week.Of course, if you can’t even entertain the idea of bringing back the vacation-inspired chokers of your youth, there are plenty of other shell-designed iterations of this under-the-sea trend that feel a bit more refined. Traditional conch shell designs, spiraling shark eyes, and sophisticated sand dollars with opalescent finishes feel more sophisticated (and office-appropriate) than kitsch or novel.And let’s be clear about one thing: last year’s coin necklaces are a timeless, ultra-wearable jewelry piece, so we’re certainly not writing them off as a thing of the past. But if you’ve grown tired of the endlessly ubiquitous coin trend, opt for one of these fresh, under-the-sea (and summer-ready) alternatives, instead.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

"47 Out-of-the-Box Pearl Pieces to Shop, Because Can You Ever Have Too Many Pearls?","I’ve never had a particularly kitschy fashion sense, but lately, accessorizing with a bit of whimsy just brings me joy—hence why I’m leaning into 2020’s fruit jewelry trend so damn hard. Somewhere between the cottagecore/picnic aesthetic and the classic Girl Next Door exists a perfect blend of the two: The Girl Next Door Who Owns Too Many Plants, Has A Window Sill Garden & Wears Fruit Jewelry. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m happy to announce that I am she. She is me. We are one.But to be clear, I’m not the only one in love with the look. After luxury brands like Mercedes Salazar debuted fun, fruity accessories for summer (I’ve been dreaming about their Tropics Strawberry Earrings for months) and Insta-famous brands like Et Toi Paris littered my Explore Page with cutesy fruitsy jewelry, it seemed the trend was everywhere—and don’t even get me started about the amount of fruit jewelry on Etsy. It’s not to be believed, y’all. Whether or not you think a salad complements your meal, a fruit-themed accessory can and will complement your outfit, so don’t hesitate to try the trend out.Bella Gerard.My personal recommendation for cute statement fruit jewelry that doesn’t look cheesy? I’ve been lovingUK-based brand I’MMANY London‘s Summer Capsule ’20, full of strawberries, grapes and the like. I’MMANY’s collection is about as chic as produce-themed jewelry can get, and the star of the show are undoubtedly their wide array of cherry earrings. You can shop single-drop stems or two-cherry earrings, and choose from a classic red hue to more playful colorways like iridescent lilac, pink and light gray.Bella Gerard.   Double Cherry Drop Earrings$124.60     Buy Now Besides the gold-plated brass brass stems, the coloring on theDouble Cherry Drop Earringslooks so realistic—like, it almost looks as if I went to the grocery store and Michael’s and DIY’d these babies myself. While cherries can sometimes look a little too retro or kitschy, these are actually super classy, and I especially love the idea of pairing them with an all-white outfit, a reddish lip stain and some faux freckles for good measure.Bella Gerard.   Red StrawberryHuggie Hoop Earring$56.64     Buy Now A slightly smaller statement that’s just as sweet is theRed StrawberryHuggie Hoop Earring, sold singular so that you can mix and match with I’MMANY’s other huggie hoops, should you choose to. Fruit jewelry is already as bold as I’ll go, so I played it safe with two red strawberries, but there are also sweet little leaves and berries of all sorts of colors to choose from. My favorite part? That itty-bitty pearl detail at the top, of course.Bella Gerard.If you’re ready to spice up your neutral summer wardrobe with a few statement accessories, the fruit jewelry trend is the move, and I can’t recommend I’MMANY London’s selection enough. Did I mention they also have a Garden Society Collection full of even more produce? Suddenly, I’m in need of a red pepper necklace and a lettuce leaf charm bracelet.

10 Autumn Accessory Trends You Best Believe I'm Shopping This Fall,"There are few celebs I admire more than Hailey Bieber when it comes to off-duty style. I honestly can’t think of a time when I didn’t want to copy something she’s worn—and if her Instagram feed is any indication, it looks like Bieber is ready to serve up inspo for my entire summer wardrobe, especiallymy beach outfits! The model just posted a pic in the most delicate gold body chain and I’m obsessed with her take on styling body jewelry for 2021.ICYMI: It’s May, people! Summer is here and no one is more ready for warm weather than Hailey Bieber. I mean, she’s already showing off her bikini collection on the ‘gram and I’m taking detailed notes! Her most recent post featured a baby pink string bikini from TRIANGL paired with the real star of the show, a glimmering body chain by Jacquie Aiche styled with two coordinating diamond necklaces. She topped off her look with a pair of chunky gold hoop earrings and a few Y2K-inspired mini ponytails around the crown of her head. Yup, copying this look ASAP!         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Hailey Rhode Baldwin Bieber (@haileybieber)If the words “body chain” traumatize you, fear not. These are not the chunky waist chains of the early aughts! Bieber’s version is of a far more delicate nature, which feels much more modern and chic. It also makes the accessory more wearable in my eyes. You can style it like she did over a bikini or wear it under any number of crop tops for some added glitz. Forget other jewelry trends of the season: This summer is all about the beachy body bling.Bieber’s chain was covered in diamonds and costs more than a few thousand bucks, so no, it’s not exactly affordable. But you can still get the look for less! I was able to source a few inexpensive options for you to buy right now if you are trying to copy her blingy bikini vibes. Each of the body chains below retail for under $15 bucks; read on to snag one for yourself.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

The Chicest Fall Accessories Trends—and Ways to Shop Them All,"When I was a wee elementary schooler, nothing—and I meannothing—made me feel as cool as I did when I wore an anklet. The early-aughts anklets trend empowered me to feel like a beach beauty and badass surfer girl rolled into one. As I lived in middle Tennessee, I was basically never wearing an anklet on or near the beach (or really, anywhere other than Kroger or Target). But I feltcool. I felttransported. I felt like the kind of fashion-forward 8-year-old I knew I was every time I spent hours styling and re-styling my Polly Pocket dolls. 2019’s take on the anklets trend has basically left me feeling the exact same way.These days, my time outdoors is no longer spent near-exclusively at Kroger and Target. And my time spent indoors is no longer spent near-exclusively styling Polly Pocket dolls. (Don’t fret—I’ve been sans Polly Pocket since middle school. You are not reading a fashion story penned by a 25-year-old who still plays with dolls.) I am still in middle Tennessee, so decidedly far from basically any beach—leaving me anything but a beach beauty or badass surfer girl (or some endlessly cool hybrid of the two). I’m an editor who spends her days writing in coffeeshops, working out at the YMCA and—when I’m feeling fancy—eating at Nashville’s trendiest restaurants. None of these settings lend themselves particularly well to anklets, especially now that I’m a 25-year-old with a full-time job andnot an elementary schooler who can basically wear anything she damn well pleases.It’s been challenging, then, for me to wrap my head around the 2019 anklet renaissance. As a fan of basically every retro revival to hit the zeitgeist, I’m predisposed to love it. But as a bona fide adult with a 9-to-5, I’m perplexed as to how—and where—to wear it. Anklets’ beachy connotations leave them feeling ill-fit for the office—let alone any semi-fancy affair, like a party or nice dinner. But I’ve reached a simple conclusion: Anklets are simply too fun to overthink. They’re abundantly on offer in every fast-fashion retailer imaginable, they’re priced competitively, and they’refun. They still make me feel cool and fashion-forward, even if I haven’t figured out their best sartorial application. And they still transport me—just in a slightly different way. Instead of making me feel like my toes are in the sand, they make me feel like my toes are in the fluffy carpet that lined the floors of the house where I grew up—or in a pair of jelly sandals, following my mom’s grocery cart as she darted from aisle to aisle at Kroger.Nostalgia is a beautiful thing.

11 Exciting New Ways to Wear Tortoise Shell This Season,"These ain’t your grandma’s pearls! The pearl jewelry trend blowing up this season is all about adding modern twists to the classic strand. We’re talking statement earrings, mismatched sizes and plenty of stackable rings. After tons of pearls were spotted at the inauguration ceremony this week, I realized just how badly I wanted a strand of my own. The second I typed “pearls” into Google, though, hundreds of options popped up. I should have figured that just about everyone in the world would want some, too.Pearls are often typecast as stuffy, but the look received a revival via TikTok when Gen-Z fashion gurus started showing off their Vivienne Westwood necklaces as the finishing touch to their cool-girl vintage ‘fits. The VW versions retail for hundreds of dollars and are pretty much sold out everywhere at the moment, but there are tons of other trendy brands selling pearls right now to consider. Brands like Mejuri, Missoma and Maison Irem sell alternatives that I can actually afford and totally love, so it looks like I’ll be purchasing more than a few pieces this season.Surprisingly, real pearls on their own aren’t all that expensive, so this use this trend as the perfect excuse to treat yourself without breaking the bank. Whether you opt for a string of real pearls or go for an authentic-looking (and cheaper) imitation version, you’re gonna want to wear these pieces with everything.Keep reading if you’re ready to think of this classic style in a whole new light.

All the Spring Flats We're Eyeing Right Now,"As someone who was never an avid jewelry wearer growing up (I also attribute this to my horrible taste in fashion — early 2000s kids will know), I’ll be the first to admit that when I heard of using jewelry as an heirloom, I was a bit confused. I mean, why not leave me a house or better yet, a briefcase full of cash? But then I received a present from my mother for Christmas. It was a ring and I was instantly in love — it’s also a much more practical gift than a briefcase of cash. I thought to myself, this is a ring I will wear forever, as it’s simple, classy, and timeless. So timeless in fact that I thought, “this is a staple piece I could hopefully pass down to my future kids.”Passing down jewelry from generation to generation is not a new concept, but it is one that I feel isn’t as prominent as it used to be. Maybe that’s because the jewelry trends have changed so much throughout the years, we wouldn’t be seen wearing something from the early 1900s. Or perhaps, you’re more inclined to wear vintage clothing rather than vintage jewelry (no judgment, here!). Either way, I am 100% prepared to make the case for why jewelry is the way to go when it comes to keeping something in the family. If you’re a skeptic, buckle up because, by the end of this article, I’ll make a jewelry heirloom believer out of you.It helps preserve memoriesOur loved ones unfortunately aren’t going to be around forever. Luckily, we have ways of remembering them, whether it be our memories, old photographs, the names we choose to give (I can attest to this as my middle name is my grandmother’s name), and of course, jewelry. If you consider yourself a fashionista already starting to think about your legacy and how you want future generations to remember you, passing down a timeless infinity bracelet will ensure you’re always known as “the one in the family who had great style.”Pandora.   Pandora Moments Infinity Knot Snake…$85     Buy Now Things always come back in styleLet’s face it — trends always come back in style. Round glasses? Check. Wide-leg pants? Check. Thin eyebrows? Check (unfortunately). My point is if you think those earrings you’re thinking of passing down won’t be in, come 20 years from now, chances are you’re mistaken. Trust me, I’ve seen firsthand how fashion has evolved over time and one thing’s for sure — fashion always makes a comeback. Take the Sparkling Halo Heart Hoop Earrings from Pandora for example. They’re giving me early 1900s Titanic Hope Diamond vibes and I am so here for it.Pandora.   Sparkling Halo Heart Hoop Earrings$115     Buy Now It’s practical andsentimentalJewelry is something we’ll actually wear if passed down (as opposed to a ball gown). Whether you’re going to work, a fancy event, or spending an evening out with friends, accessories are the perfect addition to an outfit. And if you’re wearing (or decide to pass down) a piece of jewelry to or from a family member, that piece will always hold some sentimental value. One practical, yet stylish Pandora jewelry piece is its Sparkling Tennis Bracelet. It makes the perfect gift for any occasion given its history dating back to the 80s, and one that anyone would be thrilled to wear for years.Pandora.   Sparkling Tennis Bracelet$115     Buy Now It’s valuableBecause it’s a family heirloom that is passed down, that means it only needs to be paid for by the initial wearer. It’s no secret that jewelry can get expensive (think thousands of dollars), which is why passing a piece down generations is a thoughtful gesture. The value of a certain accessory can also go up over time so you’ll definitely want to get something that’s worth every penny like Pandora’s gold-plated Sparkling Round Halo Ring.Pandora.   Sparkling Round Halo Ring$115     Buy Now You can make something new from itFun fact: any piece of jewelry can be repurposed or redesigned into a brand new piece. So, if you’re looking to make your grandmother’s old diamond earrings into a ring, or earrings into a necklace, it is possible. If not, there are plenty of jewelers out there who know how to clean and repair old items. Until then, enjoy the staple pieces like these 14k gold-plated stud earrings with clear cubic zirconia while you can until you pass them on for the next person in your family to wear.Pandora.   Sparkling Round Halo Stud Earrings$115     Buy Now It always makes the perfect giftWhether you’re passing down a piece of jewelry for Mother’s Day, a birthday, or just because, accessories are always a great way to show the style icon in your life how much you love them. Take the Sparkling Endless Hearts Chain Bracelet for example. With a line of sterling silver hearts, it’s the perfect way to keep your memory alive for generations.Pandora.

Urban Outfitters' Summer 2019 Collection Is Exactly as Cute as You'd Expect,"Giving your children piercings and other body modifications is a tricky topic for lots of people—meaning even Kylie Jenner gets mom-shamed for Stormi’s hoop earrings. The Keeping Up With the Kardashiansstar debuted baby Stormi’s latest look on the ‘gram, only to be met with a barrage of criticism over the hoops. Clearly, plenty of these commenters never had their ears pierced as babies (a practice that is commonplace inmanycultures and communities). Or even if they did; some appear to just be trolling the star and her daughter, for hate’s sake.The toddler, who recently celebrated her second birthday with Kylie and dad Travis Scott, didn’t seem bothered. Yet concerned citizens weighed in via Instagram’s comments section, levying cries of abuse and Stormi acting too “grown-up” for these big, bad hoops (which, lest we forget to mention, are even personalized with her name).One user went so far as to suggest that Stormi could face undeserved criticism for looking “ghetto” with these earrings. “lil sis this little baby is cute… however she’s too young for earrings this size…” wrote Instagram user @antoniamoore9229.“From a mother of another black girl…we don’t put earrings on our little girls that size and style because we don’t want people to talk about our kids in negative ways…and calling our children ghetto,” the user added. “she’s an adorable little girl…please save the earrings for her until she’s 12 or 15 years old.” Um.         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Kylie 🤍 (@kyliejenner)We’re going to chalk that one up to a difference in perspectives. What weshouldbe weighing in on is why anyone would term Black jewelry trends as “ghetto” in the first place, whether or not they’re on a baby (this writer from the Bronx wore hoops as young as Stormi, thank you very much).

"Opal Jewelry to Shop, Because Iridescent Is the New Black","One of the hardest things about shedding the mask post-vaccine, aside from, you know, the trauma of the last 18 months, was wanting to tell the world you’re vaccinated and safe to take off the covering.

Shop The Exact Gummy Bear Ring From Olivia Rodrigo's New 'Brutal' Video,"As anyone with an Instagram knows all too well, coin jewelry pervaded the zeitgeist in 2018. Celebrities and “it” girls, alike, adorned their necks with lightweight metal discs meant to look like money—breathing new life into the layered jewelry trend that’s endured for years on end. Though the shell jewelry movement threatened to upend coin jewelry’s reign, it turns out the two aren’t mutually exclusive, after all. Both coin jewelry and shell jewelry are making their way into 2019—offering us a veritable plethora of statement jewelry to choose from.This summer’s coin jewelry trend isn’t the far cry from last year’s you might expect. Coin pendants still abound, leaving minimalists with plenty of ways into the continued trend. But 2019’s coin jewelry movement has seen some maximalist remixes, too. Heavy coin chokers are on offer—so are lengthy chain necklaces, crafted from coin-covered string upon coin-covered string. Now that the aughts have crept into our day-to-day, coin belts are seeing some traction too. As are coin statement earrings—and layered necklaces that capitalize on both the coin jewelry trend and its competitor, the shell jewelry trend, at once.All this is to say: Your favorite retailers have ensured that it’s never too late to hop aboard the coin jewelry bandwagon. If last year’s trend came and went before you had a chance to wrap your sartorial mind around it, you’re in luck, because you still have a whopping season (who knows—maybe even more) to embrace coin jewelry in all its shiny glory.1.

101 Festival-Ready Pieces Worth Shopping Right Now,"Ah, fall fashion. I couldn’t love it more if I tried! Fall is definitely my favorite season when it comes to styling, as I can combine my favorite aspects of winter (like chic jackets and fun layering) and summer (like showing some skin and playing with color) to create an especially dreamy wardrobe. This season, I really want to go all out, so I’m shopping the top fall fashion trends early to get ahead of the game.What’s in, you ask? The classics. Oversized blazers and slacks will be making a highly anticipated return but this year, they’re joined by cozy striped sweaters and ballet flats (cue gasp). Yes, ballet flats! The shoe we all thought was doomed to being an early 2000’s fashion faux pas has made a triumphant comeback. Hopefully, you’re ready to give them a second turn.Denim is also eager for a reinvention beyond baggy jeans and jackets and is coming in at full force in dress form. I dare you to layer a denim tank dress over a striped sweater (it’ll be amazing).As for accessories, maximalist jewelry is still all the rage. Statement pendants are the coolest way to express yourself this season.

Just ask Hailey Bieber, who’s always seen in a new pair of parachute pants when she’s off duty or supporting Justin at a show. This trend is a callback to the ’90s and we’re here for it. Especially when it’s paired with a tighter top to balance out the weight of the ensemble. Even better: basically any shoe looks good with these bottoms. Ballet flats, chunky sneakers, boots, trainers you name it.Courtesy of Urban Outfitters.Balloon Cargo PantsGet the look of cargo pants with the comfort of cotton bottoms when you wear these balloon trousers. This pair from Urban Outfitters comes in so many unique colorways that will help you add a pop of color to whatever outfit you’ve got planned. In our opinion, the bolder and brighter you go, the better.   iets frans… Balloon Cargo Pant$75     Buy Now Courtesy of Everlane.The Way-High Drape PantYes, it’s possible to bring the baggy pants trend to the office. Case in point: these checkered bottoms from Everlane. They still give your legs the freedom to move around unrestricted but have a bit more structure to them so that HR would approve.   The Way-High Drape Pant$128     Buy Now Sailor StripesStripes are a pattern that comes in so many widths, colors, and formats that it never goes out of style—unlike cheetah print which runs in just as fast as it runs out. However, there are moments where stripes break out of their preppy affiliation and find their way into every aesthetic. This is one of those moments. Sailor-style stripes in the classic navy and white pairing are about to be hanging over every fashionable set of shoulders this fall. The pattern looks great in a loose-knit weave sweater, long sleeve t-shirt or even on a blazer. Pro tip: always check the men’s selection of sweaters if you love an oversized look.Courtesy of Mango.Striped Knit SweaterIs it a little too early to be wearing a full-on sweater? Yes.

Now before you decide this trend isn’t for you, I beg you to take a deep breath and let go of the grudge you have against ballet flats. I promise that nobody is asking you to wear them with skinny jeans or a skater skirt. Instead, picture yourself wearing them with linen slacks, chic midi skirts, vintage denim and even a low-rise mini skirt. Cool right? I’m so excited to embrace this trend and become the shining star of Balletcore.Courtesy of Zara.Bow Trim Leather Ballet FlatsLeave it to Zara to have the coolest (and most affordable) version of the trend.

"Yes, Matching Jewelry Is the Accessory of the Season - Here's Who You Can Get Them For","Anyone who knows me well will not be surprised to hear that tropical jewelry sits at the intersection of everything I love about fashion. The tropical print revival has long been one of my favorite trends, as its roots in “ugly” fashion run deep. Call me ascetic, but few things sound more fun than digging up some fascinating, by-all-contemporary-definitions ugly piece of clothing and rendering it trendy, chic, covetable. Nothing—not even a shirt embraced only by frat bros and dads on vacation—can trump creative styling. Tropical prints are fun, and unexpected, and challenging. And statement jewelry is delightfully campy no matter what form it’s taking. 2019’s tropical jewelry trend, then, is a marriage of two lovely, lovely things.Summer 2019 has, by all measures, really only just begun—but it’s already seen an array of statement jewelry trends enter the zeitgeist. Fruit jewelry has shown us our taste buds and our taste in clothing have more in common than we’d think. Last year’s shell jewelry trend is back and perhaps even more eye-catching than ever. And the somewhat recent friendship bracelet trend has reminded us all of the importance of wearing our hearts on our sleeves (or really, on our wrists). Tropical jewelry is joining a vast and varied cast of statement-making players—all of which are sitting idly by on digital shelves, just waiting to add a healthy dose of personality (and a trendy dose of camp) to your accessories arsenal.Though some of this season’s other jewelry trends are limited in terms of form (friendshipbracelets, for instance), tropical jewelry spans genres. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a necklace person, or an earrings person, or awhatever person—you’re sure to find a trendy piece that’ll work for you (though it bears mentioning that tropical earrings are particularly abundant). So what are you waiting for? I’m serving you a veritable plethora of ways to keep your love of the tropics close to heart and mind at all times—all you have to do is scroll down.1.

Party Pants Are Here To Add Some Flare To Your Summer Wardrobe,"And the award goes to…the STATEMENT NECKLACE! If you didn’t have time to watch the Oscars red carpet, I hate to break it to you, but you missed a lot of great looks. To bring you up to speed, allow me to present the number one Oscars 2020 jewelry trend: Necklaces.The abundance of statement necklaces on the carpet positively blew me away, and it seemed like everyone from Janelle Monae to Florence Pugh had a neck drenched in diamonds. Even though these celebs wowed in dresses that were eye-catching all on their own, many chose to couple them with chunky necklaces that were just as impressive, and it’s an accessory trick I’ll most definitely be copying for my next night-out look.Check out the biggest and blingiest necklaces of the night below, as well as a few glitzy options for trying out the look yourself.Photo: ShutterstockJanelle MonaeJanelle Monae’s spectacular hooded gown is the kind of dress that needs no accessorizing, and yet she took things one step further with a blinged-out choker to match her sparkling ensemble.Photo: ShutterstockMindy KalingMindy Kaling’s necklace isn’t just gorgeous— it’s ex$pensive. During her red carpet interview, Kaling told Ryan Seacrest that she had to have a bodyguard accompany her all night just to make sure it was safe! The Zaxie To the Moon and Back CZ Tennis Necklace gives off the same dripping-in-diamonds vibes, but at just under $100, it’s likely quite a bit more affordable than Kaling’s priceless piece.Photo: ZaxieZaxie CZ Tennis Necklace$95Buy NowPhoto: ShutterstockZazie BeetzZazie Beets wins my vote for Best Statement Necklace of the night.

The diamond and emerald masterpiece truly belongs in a museum.Photo: David Fisher/ShutterstockGreta GerwigGreta Gerwig joined Zazie in rocking an emerald-and-diamond look, and the gorgeous green gems really made her eyes pop.

So good!Photo: ShutterstockLily SinghLily Singh scrapped the diamond approach worn by so many other celebs and instead layered two pearl necklaces with a chunky golden chain.

Consider Yourself Warned: 'Ugly' Shoes Are Trending Hard for Spring '17,"Surely it would surprise no one to hear me call name tags a necessary evil. No onewants to adorn themselves with a glorified human label—an adhesive one that ruins their outfit, no less.But. One of 2019’s most visible sartorial movements—the name jewelry trend—has called this logic into question. Maybe we don’t mind wearing glorified human labels. Maybe we enjoy adorning ourselves with our names. Maybe welike accessories that do the talking—or at least, the introducing—for us.In its first iteration, the name jewelry trend was perhaps most iconically sported by two abject style goddesses: Carrie Bradshaw (of fictionalSex and the City fame) and Princess Diana. Diana was spotted, on many occasions, sporting a short necklace emblazoned with the letter D. And asSATC fans know well, Carrie wore a “Carrie” necklace throughout the show’s tenure. (The necklace even became a central plot point in one episode.) This trend, as all trends are wont to do, trickled out of the zeitgeist. And then it trickled back in. Name jewelry is now available in basically every jewelry format—earrings, chokers, bracelets, hair accessories—and basically every name format, too (which is really just to say, you can go to Diana initial route, or the Carrie full-name route).And those who find themselves a bit put off by the whole wearing their name 24/7 thing can rest assured knowing a sub-iteration of the trend has re-emerged, alongside the name jewelry one.Word jewelry—accessories inscribed with various words (notnecessarily names)—is as abundantly on offer as name jewelry is. You can sport your favorite curse word. Or announce how #blessed you are to the world. You can don jewelry that renders you a self-proclaimed queen. Hell, you can even wear Marc Jacob’s name in hoop earring form, if that were ever a thing you’d dreamt of.So crack open a dictionary and remind yourself of all your favorite words. Odds are, they’re currently available in accessory form, just waiting to be sported by the likes of you.[sc-button price=”85″ url=”https://www.shopbop.com/logo-hoop-marc-jacobs/vp/v=1/1513051330.htm” title=”Marc Jacobs The Logo Hoops”]We weren’t kidding when we said the Marc Jacobs thing.

Where to Find Affordable Alternatives to Cult Designer Jewelry,"You’ve likely already stocked up on cute, Instagram-worthy face masks these last few months, so let’s take it a step further and add some mask accessories, shall we? What started this past spring as a hunt for cloth face masks (any cloth face masks) turned into a hunt for pretty cloth face masks—which, in turn, became a hunt for ways to make wearing said masks more fun. Enter: mask straps, chains and other accessories that turn your (necessary) face mask into a full-blown lewk.If you’re skeptical about adding accessories—and, in particular, achain—to your mask, I hear you. But these beauts aren’t your grandma’s glasses chain. Both chunkyand dainty chains and straps have had a major comeback (They look really cute on sunglasses, FYI!), and the trend has transitioned seamlessly to work with all your favorite face masks. Typically, you just clip the accessories onto your mask and go! Before you know it, your safety measure will become a vital part of your outfit.Of course, there are chains and other mask accessories forall types of styles. You could opt for a pearl-adorned mask chain to give your mask a bit of a 1920s or preppy vibe, for one. Or, pair your simple black face mask with a colorful mask to spice things up. You can also go with a classic gold link mask chain, too—especially if you’re really into 2020’s jewelry trends. And if chains aren’t your thing, there are headbands and hair clips to help you keep your mask looking cute AF as well! Quite frankly, there are almosttoomany options—so we narrowed them down for you.Below, you’ll find 12 cute mask accessories to shop.

15 Statement Earrings That Look Good With a Cocktail Dress—and Even Better With Jeans,"Each year brings with it several trendy retro revivals—most cyclical, most expected. Trends come and go, and then come back again; such is the way the sartorial world works, and we’re typically excited to see old favorites making a comeback. But every so often, a vintage trend creeps into the zeitgeist and sees a resurgence none of us could have possibly predicted. Such was the case with dad sneakers, tropical prints and the enduring bike short. And now, sunglasses chains (known by many as sunglasses lanyards) are seeing a similar treatment.Earlier this month, a Free People representative told StyleCaster that sunglasses lanyards—chains that attach to the sides of your sunglasses and drape behind your head, like a backwards necklace—were poised to be big come summer 2019. And the summer accessories that retailers have on offer have only backed up this assertion. Nasty Gal, Urban Outfitters and Free People are littered with chains meant to adorn your sunglasses (or even your regular glasses), because in the age of maximalism, everything deserves a little accessorizing.We get it—this is oneseriously strange trend. Eyeglass chains feel classically vintage, whereas lanyards reek of frat bro origins. This is one odd couple that never deserved a meet-cute. Yet they got one, and when the result of this union is as sophisticated-yet-unabashedly-fun as sunglasses chains are, it’s kind of hard to be mad, no?1.

"The 19 Best Places To Buy Jewelry Online, No Matter Your Budget","Jewelry trends are among the strangest around. In 2018, we thought it advisable to hang faces from our ears. So far in 2019, we’ve grown attached to adorning ourselves with glorified nametags, sporting fruit-shaped baubles of all kinds and extending our tropical print obsession into the accessory sphere. We’ve also taken our mild obsession with hoop earrings to a new level; the hoop earrings trend has become the big hoop earrings trend, which has since become thetruly massive hoop earrings trend. A huge hoop is simply not an adequately huge hoop unless it’s huge enough to stick your entire head through.Our initial resurrection of the hoop earrings trend was a nod to the early aughts, when hoop earrings were as abundant as low-rise jeans, butterfly clips and chainmail. Metallic textiles and shiny embellishments abounded, accentuated by the circular metal hoops we hung from our ears. Though we’ve revived a great many 2000s-inspired sartorial movements, hoops have pervaded the zeitgeist unlike any other (perhaps because they’re a bit more approachable than, say, that iconic sparkly cowl mini that hardly covered Paris Hilton’s body at all). But, as we and our camp-loving hearts are wont to do, we’ve taken hoop earrings to their most voluminous extreme. We’ve demanded that they not only be circles, but that they be enormous circles—gargantuan circles. If a hoop earring isn’t big enough to graze our shoulders—or more dramatically, our collarbones—is it even a hoop earring at all?!We’d be remiss not to admit that wearing truly massive hoop earrings is a power move in its own right. And surely, being able to shove your head through your earring is a pretty impressive party trick. But all we really want to know is: Where will it end? Will we not be satisfied until hoops have become so colossal that we can fit our entire selves through them? That we can hula hoop with them? That we can loop them ’round our houses—nay, our yards? Will hoop earrings continue growing and growing until they envelop our earth?Only time will tell. For now, there is shopping to be done—and there are huge hoop earrings to be had.

"Anthropologie’s Sale Section Is An Extra 50% Off RN, And We’re Adding Everything To Cart","Growing up, pearl jewelry epitomized one thing and one thing only: classic glamour. Pearl pieces were to be paired exclusively with ball gowns and fancy gloves, making them a favorite of mine any time I went to play dress-up. As time went on, though, pearl jewelry was remixed, and then remixed again. It no longer felt exclusively reserved for the upper echelons of society; new iterations left the jewelry trend accessible to any aesthetic. And these days, pearl pieces are almost as commonplace as rhinestones were during the early aughts.Now that we’ve lifted the veil of exclusivity that once barred pearl jewelry from the masses, out-of-the-box pearl pieces have made their way into fast-fashion retailers. Pearl-covered barrettes are on the sartorial menu. So are pearl-lined chokers and pearl-dotted bobby pins. Pearl-covered hoops have offered jewelry designers a way to capitalize on two earring trends at once; the hoop-drop hybrid feels endlessly edgy, no matter how many times it’s done.The best thing about pearl jewelry isn’t its classic appeal or its aesthetic versatility—but the fact that it’s never a bad buy. No one will ever reminisce on the pearl jewelry they’ve purchased with buyer’s remorse or trend-follower’s regret. Pearl pieces are nevernot chic, no matter how out-of-the-box they are. Pearl jewelry is a no-fail purchase, and given the immense variety of unique pearl jewelry on the market right now, there’s never been a better time to stock up.1.

Thankfully, based on the Fall/Winter 2020 runways, we’re in for a pretty stylish season—with accessory trends spanning all kinds of categories. From edgy to ladylike to literal cowboy vibes, welcome to the Wild West of fall accessory trends, y’all.Of course, I couldn’t complete this lineup without an homage to fall 2020’s best accessory trend of all: the face mask.

Brands are dropping cute face masks left and right, not to mention accessories like mask chains and charms, so make sure to get at least one you really love.

On our heads, we’ll be wearing everything from berets to bandanas, and in our arms, we’ll be toting ladylike purses or handbags with slouchy, scrunched straps. And as for jewelry, the return of the statement earring has finally (!) come, along with an abundance of chunky chains and charms galore.If you thought you were going to get away with wearing a basic sweater-and-denim combo this fall without properly accessorizing, you were sorely mistaken.

Your Everything Guide to August's Birthstones,"Tortoise shell is a classic pattern marked by its multifaceted neutral coloration and patch-worked array of various tones of brown and taupe. We’re used to seeing tortoise motifs in eyewear and well, cats, but this season, we’re making the case for extending the timeless decorative design beyond its prevailing appearance in eyewear and into new territories. It’s official: Tortoise shell accessories are here, and they’re more varied than ever before.Versatile yet distinctive, tortoise designs have long offered a skin tone-flattering colorway—one that’s become a staple in our go-to cat-eye sunnies and our favorite pairs of prescription frames (you know, the ones that magically upgrade any 9-to-5 office ensemble or lazy Sunday library look). But why not bring the universally-flattering and timelessly classic tortoise shell pattern into your other accessories, as well?Tortoise shell has been making its way into jewelry—and even hair accessories as of late—and we’re more than happy to embrace the trend.

Knee-Length Denim Shorts Are the New Bike Short,"Something about spring just makes us want to shoe-shop. (Maybe the fact that we’ve been wearing the same damn pair of snow boots every day since October?? Maybe??) Now that we’re shedding layers, trading sweaters for T-shirts and whipping out our favorite relaxed jeans on the reg, we’re in dire need of footwear that feels as fresh as our spring wardrobes. That means spring heels, spring wedges and spring flats in every possible shape, texture and color. Budgets, beware—we’re coming for these shoe stores, and we’re coming for them hard.We’d be lying if we said spring flats were the first thing we thought to stock up on this season. Once we handled our sundress and swimsuit situation, we moved into top-of-mind accessory domains—namely, spring heels and wedges. Heels feel party-worthy and wedges feel vacation-worthy. In other words, they’refun, and once winter starts to wear off, we can’t bear the thought of practicality any longer. But. Once it gets hot out, no one has the energy to run around in heels and wedges all day—at least, we don’t. So when we’re getting dressed in the morning, we never find ourselves reaching for the spring heels and wedges we just bought. Those are occasion pieces, not everyday ones—and that’s exactly why spring flats are so vital.Flats get kind of a bad rap. Like we said, flats tend to get lumped in with other practical necessities—leaving them feeling kind of, well, un-fun. But the current selection of spring flats is anything but. Seriously, some of the mules, sandals and loafers on offer at your favorite retailers right now are seriously cute—cuter than some of the spring heels we’ve seen this season, and definitely cute enough to warrant a spot in your fun rotation. If you’ll let them, spring flats will elevate even the laziest of spring ensembles, and they’ll keep you comfortable while they’re at it. That’s a sartorial win/win if we’ve ever seen one. So give spring flats a chance (and a quick perusal), won’t you?1. All Black Colorblocked Slides, $149 at AnthropologieThe easiest way to dress up a tee-and-jeans combo? Slip into these.2. Fabric Moroccan Barbouches, $49.90 at ZaraWho needs beach sandals when you can wear these woven flats, instead?3.

The 5 Biggest Trends from London Fashion Week,"Statement earrings are always a good idea. But spring statement earrings are an even better one. Because no matter what day it is or what the weather’s doing outside, adorning your head with colorful, personality-filled baubles is just plain fun.But if it’s a Friday and it’s sunny outside and you’re adorning your head with colorful, personality-filled baubles, you’ve basically hit a fun jackpot. Warmth, the weekend and cute AF statement jewelry is a trifecta that truly cannot be beat.Naturally, shopping spring statement earrings has become one of our favorite pastimes in recent months. The moment the spring equinox came and went, we traded our go-to black Chelsea boots for fresh white sneakers, we swapped our sleekest black skinnies for relaxed mom jeans, and we dropped our sophisticated silver hoops to make room for, well, every pair of spring statement earrings we laid eyes on. During winter, minimalism reigns, so accessories are pretty easy to manage. But during spring and summer, maximalism comes out to play, leaving the statement jewelry landscape vaster and more varied than ever.Color is on the menu. So are kitschy shapes. So is every combination of beads and pearls and rhinestones you can possibly imagine. It’s not enough to render hoops in glitter-infused resin—you have to cover them in beads that boast paint strokes in every shade of the rainbow. Dream up a truly strange pair of spring statement earrings, and get ready to whip out your credit card—because they probably already exist. Whether you’re a fan of drop, hoop, stud or evenclip-on styles, there’s at least one pair of spring statement earrings designed with you in mind. Honestly, there are probably a few.So drop those dainty hoops and shelve your favorite studs for a while. Your go-to spring outfits are simply canvases for all the exciting accessories that await you. Stock up—and start playing.1. Rhinestone and Pearl Clip-On Earrings, $9.90 at Forever 21We’re usually heart-shaped jewelry-averse, but these are so over-the-top we simply can’t resist them.2. Natia x Lako Large Crocodile Earrings, $245 at FarfetchCrocodile earrings may sound wrong, but they look so, so right.3.

How This Indie Retailer Is Winning Over Zara Die-Hards,"Humans will never be mermaids. Or fairies. Or unicorn queens. Or the myriad other fantastic creatures that inspire our aesthetics, our Halloween costumes, our dreams. But the enduring iridescence trend has allowed us to get closer to a reality in which we are these dreamy, wonderful things; if we wear enough opal jewelry and drape our homes with enough holographic textiles, maybe—even if just for a moment—we can live out the fantasies that inhabit our imaginations.Dreams of modern-day fairytales aside, it’s impossible to look upon our modern-day love of all things iridescent with anything but absolute mesmerization. Mostly because, well, the trend is pretty damn mesmerizing. There’s something endlessly beautiful about the blend of purples, aquas and millennial pinks—the way iridescence reflects and captures light simultaneously, the depth of color that changes oh-so subtly every time you move your eyes. It’s hardnot to access the most imaginative portals of your mind every time you lay eyes on an iridescent bauble. Everything from holographic shower curtains to iridescent water bottles captivates the brain—with genuinely precious pieces, like opal jewelry, feeling the most bewitching at all.My aesthetic doesn’t lend itself well to iridescence. I’m a bright colors, bold prints, tactile-y grounded maximalist; iridescence’s airy beauty only gets lost when thrown into my heavy atmosphere. But even I can’t resists its charms. I’m as apt as anyone else to spend hours perusing shiny things—combing through the internet’s selection of truly stunning opal jewelry—simply because it’s a beautiful way to pass the time. So whether or not you’re on the market for a new iridescent ring, take a moment and lose yourself in a veritable sea of stunning opal jewelry. The practice is somewhat meditative—and at the very least, it’s fun.1.

Fall's Biggest Engagement Ring Trends—According to Jewelers,"I’m not one to say “I told you so,” but when I brought BONBONWHIMS to StyleCaster readers’ attention back in April, I knew it was the next big jewelry It Brand. Major fashionistas and celeb tastemakers like Kylie Jenner and Sofia Richie were already wearing the brand’s creative, colorful pieces—and slowly but surely, it’s amassed even more majorly famous fans. As I watched and re-watched the new music video for “Brutal,” I couldn’t help but notice Olivia Rodrigo’s jewelry in one particular scene.The “Brutal” video is, among other things, fantastic. In my opinion, it’s one of the best returns to music video-ing at its core that we’ve seen in a hot minute. And just as good as the concept and storytelling, of course, are the outfits. With portions of her face covered by virtual masks reminiscent of Instagram and Snapchat face filters, Rodrigo let her attire and accessories do the talking for the bulk of the video. That said, there was one piece in particular that stood out.In the classroom scene, Rodrigo paired a punky plaid skirt and a red tank that says “Flirt” with a red beret and braided pigtails. Finishing off the look, she rocked some silver oversized soda tab-style earrings by Pattaraphanand a rectangular, glittery red ring with a black gummy bear on top. That ring, of course, was classic BONBONWHIMS.Like it? Boy oh boy, do I have great news for you: You can snag one for yourself! BONBONWHIMS founder Clare Ngai isn’t one to send celebs exclusive pieces and leave their fans wanting something similar—she always makes sure they can get their hands on the real thing. In the past, fans went positively wild for a clear bubble ring worn by Ariana Grande, so I have no doubt that the aptly-named Brutal Ring will be the brand’s next big seller.Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do. Please note that if you purchase something by clicking on a link within this story, we may receive a small commission of the sale.Courtesy of BONBONWHIMS.   Brutal Ring$65     Buy Now TBH, even if I wasn’t a fan of Rodrigo I’d want this ring. Gummy bear jewelry has been trending all summer, but I’ve been worried that the Rainbow Brite color scheme so many brands are pushing would wear itself out by fall. A classic emo-chic color combo like black and red never gets old! I love the thought of rocking this with an otherwise understated monochrome black look as a pop of something fun and quirky. Or, you know, as part of my inevitable Olivia Rodrigo Halloween costume.Her BONBONWHIMS ring isn’t the only fun accessory Rodrigo wears in the video; she also rocks some seriously cute (And affordable! Under $50!) chunky gold hoops with flower detailing by Notte, not to mention a bevy of early aughts-inspired hair clips in the final scene. Unrelated, but I’d go as far as to say that Rodrigo is bringing pigtails back. And strangely, I’m here for it?Courtesy of Geffen Records.Bottom line, Rodrigo positively smashed her latest video. I’m thrilled that “Brutal” is her new single! It’s destined to have as much success as “Driver’s License” or “good 4 u,” just as I’m destined to copy her fashion choices and buy myself this gummy bear ring. Someone warn my credit card—it’s brutal out here! "
Olivia Palermo is Designing Under-$100 Jewelry,"Any solid festival wardrobe involves a combination of a few things: comfy clothes you can move around in all day (and night) long, pieces that are lightweight enough for midday humidity and cozy enough for breezy nights, and chic AF style. This last bit is, of course, the most fun part of this endeavor—and it’s the thing that leaves the festival clothes landscape feeling as delightful, exciting and Instagram-worthy as it does. It’s also the thing that makes me want to shop festival clothes, even though I’m not planning on attending a single festival this year.When I went to Bonnaroo some many years ago, my priority was fashion—not function. I spent my days in delightfully bohemian crop tops and short shorts that made my butt look excellent—until they rode up so significantly they basically served as a second pair of underwear. The versatile gladiators I relied on to tie my outfits together split apart halfway through the fest, leaving me in something of a footwear rut. (But hey—Bonnaroo’s an alternately dusty or muddy experience, and I simply wasn’t prepared to sacrifice any of my clean AF sneakers to the festival gods.) I wore rainbow snapbacks, adorned my hair with flower crowns and layered on Free People jewelry. My looks were photogenic as hell—but my head got seriously hot and sweaty, and I’m just not the kind of person who can stand to bounce around in beaded shit all day. By the end of the four days, I was basically relying on sports bras, tie-dye tanks and Nike shorts—a far cry from the fashion-forward looks I’d mentally assembled, but a much more practical option that kept me from getting distracted by my clothing every 19 seconds.I’ve been to a handful of festivals since then, and it’s become clear to me that the dichotomy between fashion and function is a false one—at least as far as festival clothes are concerned. The festival clothing selection is incredibly vast, and it’s full of pieces that are as practical as they are pretty (or weird, or statement-making, or breezy, or whatever other aesthetic you’re currently cultivating). Comfort and chic style are far from mutually exclusive; it’s entirely possible to craft a festival wardrobe fully of comfy clothes, and lightweight-yet-cozy necessities and head-turning looks. It’s, in fact, so possible (and so damn fun) that I’ve found myself planning festival outfits I won’t be able to wear any time soon—leaving you, dear reader, with a comprehensive guide to all the festival clothes worth shopping right now.1.

Editor's Pick: A Sleek Earring Jacket,"Our political climate is, perhaps, at one of its most regressive moments in decades. But our social climate isn’t. From the initial Women’s March to the Me Too movement, feminism looms large—with many women feeling more emboldened than ever to fight on behalf of financial parity, equitable treatment and gender equality in every possible form. This feminism manifests in myriad different ways, with each woman paving her own path in the sociopolitical sphere. But it should come as no surprise that this massive cultural movement has trickled into the realms of art and fashion, giving rise to sartorial trends, like feminist jewelry, that mimic our social movements.Our graphic tees have become more defiant, emblazoned with slogans that demand more than they concede. Our hats have become, quite literally, more vulvovaginal, standing in as symbols of our strength, our pride, our womanhood (albeit one specific—and white—form of womanhood). And even our daintiest accessories—our jewelry—have undergone something of a feminist transformation. Adorned with frank, celebratory images of the female form or even franker political slogans, our necklaces, bracelets, earrings and rings have become outlets for our voices—empowering us to express ourselves in ways as subtle as they are statement-making.We’d be ignoring the metaphorical elephant in the room if we failed to address one simple truth: Fashion may feel like a commodified and frivolous approach to the feminist movement. Capitalism is a complicated thing—one that has entrenched many women, especially women of color, in poverty. And buying a political T-shirt is no substitute for getting involved in local politics, supporting feminist candidates or turning out to vote. However, we’re of the mind that the world is better with more pro-women stuff in it. And if a woman wants to nod to her politics while getting dressed in the morning, who are we to tell her she shouldn’t?

The Best New Jewelry Brands to Know,"Summer 2021 is all about overdressing, from accessorizing with over-the-top jewelry to styling fun-as-hell party pants on a regular basis. Yes, you read that correctly: I said Party Pants. They’re here in a big way to shake up your wardrobe this season—and I am 100 percent down to have some fun.It feels like the entire Internet is sick of wearing the same thing over and over.After a year spent mostly in our pajamas and comfy (albeit cute) matching loungewear sets, it makes sense that everyone would collectively be looking forward to trying something a little different.

There are a few key signifiers for you to be aware of on your search. Oftentimes, party pants feature a high-waisted fit and a flared leg. Now, the extent of that flare is up to you—pick an option that’s a little more fitted for a relaxed vibe, or go all-out with a wider flare to make more of a splash.

When Fine Jewelry Is An Art,"Let’s get one thing clear: When we say fashion mistakes, we’re not talking about wearing an outfit that could land you on a worst-dressed list, if people were judging. Rather, we’re talking about long-held habits you refuse to break, fashion clichés you still believe are true, and small things you’re avoiding—or doing—that can wreak havoc on your personal style.From not getting things tailored enough (bad!), to buying into the idea that you have to throw certain things away before you turn 30 years old (stupid!), here are 40 fashion mistakes you should start remedying right now.Photo: Gotham/Getty ImagesYou BelieveWhite Shouldn’t Be Worn After Labor DayLadies, listen up: This is an antiquated rule that shouldn’t be followed.As countless designers and fashion stars have proven during the past fewseasons, white is not only appropriatewhen the weather turnschilly, but it’s also amazingly fresh and modern. One thing to keep in mind when tackling the white-in-winter trend: It’s all about the fabric. Lighter textiles such as white cotton, linen, canvas, and seersucker will look out of place during fall and winter, so be sure you’re reaching for white wool, cashmere, fur, mohair, flannel, silk, and leather.You Always Buy the Same Size in ClothesAs any woman who’s shopped high-fashion and fast-fashion knows, sizing can vary tremendously according to store, brand, and item. Cheaper clothing typically runs way bigger, making it common for a woman to wear, say, a size Large at Forever 21, but still be a size 2 in Stella McCartney. Don’t sweat the number—pay attention to how things look on your body instead.You Wear Retro Pieces Without a Modern SpinWe all know that fashion is cyclical and thateverythingcomes back around, but that doesn’t mean you shoulddress in full of-another-decade outfits, whichcould run the risk of making you look like you’re both in costume and 10 years older.Love the look of a wild, ’80s neon sweater you found at the Salvation Army? Leave the leggings and sneakers at home, and opt for a pair of super-sleek skinny jeans, natural hair and makeup, and a great pair of ankle boots. Found a vintage swingy midi-skirt? Style it with modern staples like a cropped leather jacket and a sleek pair of pointy heels, as opposed to wearing a pussy-bow blouse and pearls.MORE:How to Nail the Dad Sneaker Trend: A Shopping and StylingGuideYou Think ‘Dry Clean Only’ Tags Are Always CorrectIf a garment says it needs to be dry-cleaned, it won’t hurt to follow suit, but that can get pricey—especiallysince some items technically don’t need to beprofessionallycleaned. Many high-end brands that manufacture items in washable fabrics will often say “dry clean only” to keep up the higher-end vibe. Furthermore, certain fabrics, such as cashmere, actually hold up better when they’re washed by hand as opposed to getting dry-cleaned. Here’s a good guide to help you figure out what doesn’t really have to be cleaned by a pro.YouBelieveTall Women Shouldn’t Wear HeelsThis mandate isn’t only silly, but a little sexist, too. Stemming from a whole bunch of antiquated notions—including abundant height isn’t feminine, and a woman shouldn’t draw extra attention to herself—this rule is one no woman should ever follow if she doesn’t want to. We know plenty of women who are six feet tall and still rock killer heels with grace (ahem, Jenna Lyons, Charlize Theron,Michelle Obama, Karlie Kloss….)You Shop for InstagramWe hate to assume you’d buy anything simply so people know you own it, butsuchis the world in which we live. Are you buying thatBalenciagabag because you really, really love it, or because you want others to know you boughtit?If you buy those Jimmy Choopumps, will you be able to truly enjoy them without posting themto social media?If the answer is no, you might have some thinking to do about your shopping habits.MORE:100 Best Beauty Tips and Tricks You’ve GottaTryPhoto: Christian Vierig/Getty ImagesYou Avoid HorizontalStripes like the PlagueBuying into the notionthat all horizontallines make you look wide is a cliché mistake. Yes, we’ll admit that a skin-tight bodycon dress emblazoned with horizontal lines might only look good on a model, but pieces that are made well and fit well—think a classic cotton Breton striped shirt tucked into dark jeans, a ladylike full-skirt with horizontal stripes, or a great striped overcoat—flatters every woman.You Think You Can Only Wear One Bold Color at a TimeIf we’ve learned anything from the recent color-blocking phenom, it’s that a bold, saturated hue can look even better when paired with another bold, saturated hue. Wearing an emerald-green silk blouse? Don’t be afraid to wear those fuchsia suede heels or carry that sunny yellow leather clutch—you’ll look super-modern.MORE:51 Fashion-Forward Pinterest Accounts to Follow for Major StyleInspoYou Hate Shopping, so You Rely on the Same Old Dinosaurs in Your ClosetNot that into fashion or shopping? That’s fine, but you are probably into looking presentable, so it’s not the end of the world to replace those 15-year-old, square-toe brownloaferswith an updatedstyle, or replace your boot-cut black pants from the late ’90s with a pair that fits well and has a slimmer line. Go ahead and stick to the same styles, but just give them small updates. You’ll not only appear more youthful, but you’ll probably find you enjoy getting dressed a little more when you have modern pieces that fit.You Think Actual Menswear Is Just for MenObviously, you’re not going to pick up a suit at Rochester Big and Tall, but you’d be surprised by how many made-for-men pieces can work for you. This is especially true at common outposts like Forever 21, H&M, J. Crew, and Zara, whose men’s stuff—think slim-cut button-downs, sweatshirts, oversized sweaters, and utility jackets—often aren’t as trendy as their for-women counterparts, and offer a slightly slouchierfit.You Think Sweatshirts Are Strictly Casual WearOnce strictly for athletes, gym-goers, and errand-runners, the humblesweatshirthas risen to become a very stylish staple. Need proof? Top designers like Kenzo, Phillip Lim, Cynthia Rowley, and Karen Walker have been showcasing versions that are embellished and printed, while street-style stars started pairing their sweatshirts with swingy skirts, skinny trousers, and statement necklaces. And we’re not only taking about designer versions, either—your old heather-gray Hanes sweatshirt will do the trick nicely.Photo: Melodie Jeng/Getty ImagesYou Think Mixed Prints Are Way Too BusyActually, mixed prints can lookextremelyfresh, and elevate your look from ordinary to street-style ready in no time. Style pros know that anything goes when it comes to melding motifs (florals with stripes! polka dots with Ikat!), but beginners should start with this tip: Treating leopard or camo (or both) like neutrals is the easiest way to break into pattern mixing. Whatever colored print you choose, add a leopard or camo belt, shoe, bag, blouse, oranythingelse.You Think Mixing Gold and Silver is a Faux PasNot only is this idearidiculous, but it also causes you to miss out on some killer jewelry trends, like mixed-metal midi rings, delicate layered necklaces, or a seriously diverse #armparty.MORE:15 Insider Tips on How to Layer Jewelry Like aProYou Think You Can’t Wear Red to a WeddingThis somewhat ridiculous fashion rule was put intoplaceduring more conservative times when red was thought to be a way-too-sexy, attention-stealing color. Yes, you might want to stay away from wearing a skin-tight, red plunging spandex gown to a wedding, but you probably don’t want to wear that in any color. These days, there are tons of high-style red dresses that are perfectly acceptable as formal wear, as evidenced by the runways at fashion week and red carpets, on which celebrities often wear red gowns that look elegant and classic, as opposed to tawdry.A good rule of thumb: Choose red gowns with clean lines that are made from chiffon, silk, or organza, as opposed to shiny satin or anything too stretchy, and always keep embellishments to a minimum.You Get Caught up in One-Season WondersLet’s be clear: We certainly don’tthink every splurge needs to be something “classic” that’ll last until the end of time(where’s the fun in that?), but wedothink dropping a ton on something that’s so obviously the “it” item from one collection is silly.Why? Because there’s an excellent chancethat, after the season is up and the luster starts to fade, you might start to feel that your splurge was partially due to the immediacy of having something coveted, rather than having something you’ll adore long-term.You Think ‘Classics’ Have to Cost a Ton of MoneyMost women can’t—or prefer not to—drop a ton of cash on clothes every season, even onstaples we’re told will always be in style. That’s why off-price retailers such as TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Century 21 are so great for scoring realdesignerpiecesat a fraction of the cost. Even several fast-fashion stores like Zara, ASOS, and Uniqlo are upping theirgame and quality,offeringanarrayof timeless piecessuch aswool overcoats, leather Chelsea boots, wool and cashmere sweaters, and silk blouses at seriously wallet-friendly prices.You Think Faux Diamonds Are a Faux PasWhile fake designer bags are a hugedon’t, fake diamond studs in a reasonable size are a hugedo. Why? Because faux stones are hard to spot to the untrained eye.You Believe Loose Styles Flatter Plus-Size Women MostIt’s a myth that loose, flowy styles flatter a large bust or a plus-size woman. The area just under the bust is a woman’s smallest torso measurement, so emphasizing it with a structured waistband that hits higher than your natural waist will make you look a size smaller.MORE:13 Genius Curvy-Women Styling Tips We Can Learn from AshleyGrahamYou Think Jeans Should Be Washed as Much as Your Other ClothingDenim aficionados know that raw denim can take up to six months to break in and shouldn’t be washed until then.Why? Jeans really do conform to our bodies, and when you wash them, most of the shape is lost.Most jeans today, however, are treated (pre-washed to achieve a faded look) and don’t need to be broken in. These you can wash more often, butonlywhen they’re stained or when they start to sag. To zap odors, hang them in the bathroom while you’re showering or freeze them in a plastic bag for a day or two.Photo: Christian Vierig/Getty ImagesYou Think High-Waisted Pants Are Always UnflatteringHigh-waist bottoms get a bad rap,probablythanks toan unfortunate Jessica Simpson style mishap, but when worn correctly, they can trick the eye into thinking you’re taller and leaner by elongating your lower body. The most slimming item to choose areslightlyhigh-rise slim-fitting jeans that hit your ankle, or simple high-black black trousers.You Think Sequins Can’t Be Worn During the DayA modern trick to looking like the most effortlessly stylish girl on the street: Pair dressy bottoms like a beaded skirt, or sequin pants) with casual staples like a white shirt, a gray crew-neck sweatshirt, or a black blazer. Likewise, choose topswith sequin detailing, and pair them with boyfriend jeans.You Don’t Store Your Pricey Shoes CorrectlyHaphazardlythrowingyour shoes into the closet is one of the worst things you can do, so if you’re going to keep them outside of a box or bag, nearly line them up in pairs on your closet’s floor or on a shelf with amplebreathingroom between pairs. Also, don’t store good shoes near direct sunlight, which can cause fading and majordiscoloration. Here are more tips on how to care for those designer shoes!You Never Get Anything TailoredThis is undoubtedlyone of the biggest fashion mistakes a person can make. Think about it: We’re all built differently, so mass-produced clothing won’t fit us all the same way. Having a tailor tweak hemlines, seams, sleeve lengths, even taking in too-wide garments can be the differencebetween looking fine and lookingabsolutely impeccable all the time.MORE:12 Comfortable and Stylish Must-Haves for Spring Under$100You Think Sexy Means Showing Tons of SkinIf you truly believe that sexy means dressing for stereotypical men—teeny-tiny skirts, skintight dresses, low-cut tops—you’re doing yourself (and your style) a giant disservice. Love your body and want to show it off? Great! Do it in ways that are truly sexy, as opposed to flashy—tight jeans and a silky top, a long-sleeve mini-dress with ankle boots, or a great pair of heels paired with a curve-hugging pencil skirt.Photo: Christian Vierig/Getty ImagesYou Swore You’d Never Wear Sweatpants Outside the HouseAs recent sportif trends have showcased, a well-fitting pair of track pantscan actually look very cool when paired with things like peep-toe booties or heels, and a structured blazer. See how to style yourshere.You Hoard Certain Items, Instead of Owning One Good OneObviously, we all have our staples, and we gravitate toward the same types of items when we shop—it’s called having taste. However, if you find yourself quite literally buying a cheapstriped shirt every single time you shop, it might be time to cut back. Not only does that mean you’re not satisfied with the shirts crammed into yourcloset, but it’s a knownfact that the more you own, the less you wear.If you’re still on the hunt for the perfect Breton stripe shirt (or black button down, white jeans, Chelseaboots, or whatever you buy over and over), take all the versions you own out and give them a good, hard look. Donate or sell the ones you’re not in love with, and take some time to hunt down the perfect one, as opposed to stocking up on a bunch of mediocre ones.You Buy into the ‘Take One Accessory’ off School of ThoughtWe hate when women regurgitate the dated rule that we should always remove an accessory before leaving the house. Why? Because fabulous women likeIris Apfel and a host of fashion bloggers, jewelry designers, and street-style stars have proven time and time again that piling on the bling can be fabulous and totally idiosyncratic.Photo: Sciulli/Getty Images for Sunglass HutYou Think Short Girls Can’t Wear Maxi SkirtsIt’s common fashion folklore that small women simply can’t wear floor-grazing skirts and dresses, but luckily that’s been proven entirely false. In fact, a well-cut maxi skirt can actually give you the appearance of looking taller, as evidenced by petite gals, likeRachel Bilson,Rachel Zoe, andMary-Kate Olsen. Choose solid versions that skim the length of your body, which will create a long, vertical line (forego anything with thick pleats or too many layers). Be sure to keep your top fitted—a tucked-in T-shirt and a cropped leather jacket, for example—so as to not drown in fabric. Also, make sure the skirt’s hemline is as long as you can go without tripping, and add a pair of wedges or heels underneath.MORE:17 of the Most Stylish Items on Amazon Under$40You Think Denim on Denim Is a Fashion Don’tAlso known as a Canadian tuxedo, the easiest trick to rocking double denim without looking like you got lost on the way to the cattle ranch:Pair pieces of varying washes together, such as a light denim shirt with dark denim jeans, or a dark denim jacket with a light-wash pair of boyfriendjeans.You Stay Away from Black and NavyThis fashion rule still has its fair share of subscribers, but let us make it clear: Navy and black look extremely fresh together, as evidenced by recent collections from designers like Carolina Herrera, Miu Miu, Gucci, Prabal Gurung, and Céline. Plus, It-gals like Alexa Chung, and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen can’t get enough of mixing the hues.Even if it’s only adding a pair of opaque black tights to a navy blue dress, it’s a mistake to not try it out.Photo: Timur Emek/Getty ImagesYou Think Clutches Are Only for NighttimeIt seems the after-hoursstaple is fast moving into daylight, as we’ve been spotting countless influencers using small, strap-free bags during the day at Fashion Week, on various style blogs, and right here in New York City on any given day. While some are fairly casual, like oversized leather clutches, others are dressy (i.e., shiny gold clutches and beaded clutch bags), and all look fabulous with things like fadedboyfriendjeans.You Think Sneakers Are Only for the GymAs recent trends have proven, the right pair of sneakers can take you way beyond the gym. Between wedge sneakers, slip-on sneakers (ahugetrend for fall), and the rise of top bloggers and fashioninsidersrocking sporty Nikes, New Balance, and Adidas kicks with everything from sleek skirts toleatherpants, it’s clear that when styled with dressier pieces,sneakerscan add a modern twist to an outfit that’s not comprised solely of sweats.You BelieveShorts Have No Place on the Fall and WinterThere’s something incredibly cool and fuss-free about rocking a pair of shorts in the winter paired with opaque black tights and ankle booties. Stay away from shorts in summery fabrics like eyelet and cotton, but go ahead and rock shorts made from leather, wool, jacquard, even denim cutoffs, which offer a nice change of pace from skirts when paired withboots,tights, and achunkysweater come fall and winter.Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty ImagesYou Think Long Hair Makes You More AttractiveThis is a biggie: Far too many independent women want to experiment with new hairstyles, butbelieve that a mane of long hair makes them more attractive to themselves and to men. First of all, some of the most beautiful women in the world, including Scarlett Johansson, Beyoncé, and supermodel Jourdan Dunnhave embraced sexy chops. Secondly, not every woman was born to have super-long hair. In fact, many women end up looking betterwith acut that better showcases herfeatures.Not to mention, shorter lengths can also make petite girls look taller,and curvier girls slimmer.MORE:21 Celebrity Pixie Cuts That Will Inspire You to GoShorterYou Always Look like You’re Dressed as ‘Fashion’ for HalloweenMeaning: You’re a walking advertisement for trends and/or labels to the point where it looks like you have no point of view of your own.

Lists that tell you all the things you need to throw awaybefore you hit 30 are just a cheap ploy.And they’re untrue! A list like that might say you can’t wearultra low-rise jeans in your ’30s, but hello—look as Isabel Marant! The French designer pretty much exclusively sends super-low jeans down the runway. Sure, they’re styled in a more modern way than the low-riders of the early aughts, butthey’re still low-waisted jeans; so doesn’t it seem silly to rule them out because a list tells you to?Age-appropriate styling is really what you should be following, which means knowing how to take pieces you like and making them look chic without being trendy, comfy without being messy, and vaguely sexy without being overt.40 Fashion Mistakes That are Ruining Your Style | @stylecasterA version of this article was originally published in October 2014.

Clunky, clinical, and vaguely orthopedic-looking footwear has been elevated in recent seasons from fashion taboo to street-style staple—just look at the resurgence of Birkenstocks, Teva’s collaborations with Opening Ceremony and Nasty Gal, and, most recently, the gem-embellished Crocs Christopher Kane sent down the runway at his tenth anniversary show last month at London Fashion Week.MORE: The 50 Most Important Bags from the Spring ’17 RunwaysFor Spring 2017, designers have doubled down on their affection for all forms of maligned shoes: on top of the Crocs, there were flip-flops (Dolce and Gabbana, Alexander Wang, Dries van Noten), water shoes (MSGM, Markus Lupfer), Teva-esque velcro sandals (Emporio Armani, Maison Margiela, Anna Sui),and a second coming of the Chinese mesh slipper (Noon By Noor).Then there were those that presented new silhouettes sure to confuse most of the straight male population, such as Paco Rabanne, whose tube-sock-sandal hybrids my coworker helpfully described as “condoms for your feet,” and Gucci, whose four-inch flatforms were topped withwallpaper-floral ankle-boot uppers.MORE: How to Wear the Biggest Jewelry Trend of Spring ’17 Right NowAnd while sure, ugly-chicmay not be for everyone, these will no doubt find plenty of fans among the more adventurous fashion crowd.Below, get a taste of what we’re all in store for next season with 21 of the most divisive pairs of shoes from the Spring ’17runways. 0Thoughts?1 of 21Gucci Spring 2017Christopher Kane x Crocs Spring 2017Maison Margiela Spring 2017Prada Spring 2017Dolce and Gabbana Spring 2017Paco Rabanne Spring 2017Anna Sui Spring 2017Anya Hindmarch Spring 2017Christopher Kane x Crocs Spring 2017Emporio Armani Spring 2017Fendi Spring 2017Maison Margiela Spring 2017Markus Lupfer Spring 2017MSGM Spring 2017Noon by Noor Spring 2017Paco Rabanne Spring 2017Prada Spring 2017Stella McCartney Spring 2017Toga Spring 2017Undercover Spring 2017Hood By Air Spring 2017Next slideshow starts in 10s11 Quick 60-Second Hairstylesfor Work and School "
Celebrity Spawn Zoë Kravitz Designs Capsule Collection For Swarovski,"About a month ago, I got it into my head that I absolutely needed a pair of tassel earrings. Maybe it was something I saw on Instagram—actually yeah, it was definitely something I saw on Instagram—but I couldn’t type my search into Google fast enough.Sure enough, the pair I spotted on my feed were by Oscar de la Renta, and came with a $400 price tag—not engagement-ring expensive, sure, but more than I can justify spending on something that I’m embarrassingly prone to losing. So, to Etsy it was, where I scoured page after page of search results—my personal K-hole of choice—to find the perfect affordable dupes.MORE: Your Complete Guide to Plastering Yourself in ’90s Sportswear LogosIn the end, I settled on a vintage pair which, while far from identical, offered the same satisfying swinginess and length as my beloved Oscar earrings—but I was also impressed by the number of sellers offering handmade versions inspired by the classic design. Amid all the Pinterest-perfect nameplate necklaces and steampunk-style watch pendants there’s actually a surprisingly deep trove of modern, cool jewelry on the e-commerce site.So, as a bit of a test, I decided to see if I could do the same with some of the other pricey baubles the fashion industry is currently obsessing over—using Etsy as well as some indie jewelry designers and affordable mass retailers.

5 Ways to Use Fashion Items To Decorate,"We all know the transformational power that adding the right jewelry can have on an ensemble.The “less is more” mantra that’s informed accessorizing best practices in years past has become downright dated, thanks to the enduring advent of maximalism (which frankly, has made fashion a lot more fun). That said, maximalismhas complicated things; statement jewelry options are now basically endless, meaning accessory decisions are harder than ever to make.Here at StyleCaster, we’ve taken to simplifying our accessory repertoires a bit. We’ve traded statement necklaces, bracelets and rings for statement earrings this holiday season, and we haven’t looked back.While oversized statement necklaces, French girl-approved coin chokers and chunky cuffs can offer any ensemble an instant upgrade, earrings can complement your outfitand your hairstyleand your makeup look—and even your bone structure, too. Best of all, because statement earrings tend to be more understated than other forms of costume jewelry, they practically invite you to play with texture, embellishment and pattern in a way you might not otherwise think to.The best part? Statement earrings pair just as well with formal wear as they do with plain white tees; they’ll elevate any outfit—whether it’s the LBD you’ve relied on for years, or the just-rolled-out-of-bed look you threw together before brunch this morning.Statement earrings are the must-have accessory that’s as understated as it is maximalist—and as versatile as it is statement-making. And we can’t get our hands on enough. Whether you’re looking to inject a little fun into your tried-and-true earring rotation, or whether you’re a die-hard maximalist looking for her next accessory fix, we’ve got you.Ahead, our favorite statement earrings on the market right now—all of which you could sport to a New Year’s Eve party, and then repurpose for casual wear all 2019 long.Shopbop.Rachel Comey Marquee Earrings, $185 at ShopbopThese translucent, art deco-inspired studs are versatile enough to pair with anything.BaubleBar.Dulcinea Drop Earrings, $42 at BaubleBarThese crystal-embellished drop earrings feature a pop of blush resin detail, giving them atouch of femininity.Farfetch.Oscar de la Renta Tassel Earrings, $395 at FarfetchThese luxe tassel earrings are like your favorite eye-catching red lipstick—but for your ears.Net-a-PorterAlessandra Rich Crystal Clip Earrings, $345 at Net-a-PorterThese crystal-adorned studs give any look a touch of playful charm without giving off childhood playing-dress-up vibes.Mango.Rhinestone Pendant Earrings, $29.99 at MangoThese pendant earrings look extra luxe peeking out from side parted hair style.Free People.Reflection Asymmetric Earrings, $38 at Free PeopleMismatched earrings are one of jewelry’s biggest trends du jour, but they can come across as totally casual if you style them right.Net-a-Porter.Rosantica Strobo Crystal Earrings, $315 at Net-a-Porter’80s-inspired clip-ons will give any look a touch of retro-glam appeal.Nordstrom.Kate Spade New York Pouf Earrings, $68 at NordstromThe marabou trend that’s adorned footwear and handbag key chains for years has finally made its way up to the ears.Matches Fashion.Oscar de la Renta Chain Cluster Beaded Earrings, $594 at Matches FashionBecause nothing holds its own against a beaded dress like a pair of beaded earrings.Revolve.LPA Angel Hoops Earrings, $98 at RevolveEncrusted with eye-catching pearls, these aren’t your everyday hoops.Nordstrom.Kendra Scott Fabiana Statement Earrings, $250 at NordstromThese animated sunburst earrings are sure to add a touch of drama to your look without competing with any of its elements.Free People.Dannijo Rose Earrings, $258 at Free PeopleThese classic gemstone earrings get a romantic upgrade with rose stud detailing.ShopBop.Zimmerman Orchid Statement Earrings, $395 at ShopbopPetal details are always pretty, but these chic drop earrings exude a “cool girl,” appeal thanks to the mismatched lengths and sculptural cut.Nordstrom.Something Navy Rhinestone Chandelier Earrings, $29 at NordstromFor a more modest statement, opt for these chandelier earrings.

"Birchbox Founders on Spring Trends, How to Take Hair from Day to Night","For the 2016 shopper seeking jewelry with a personal touch, there are monogram pendants, birthstone rings, or bracelets inlaid with gemstones spelling out a codeword of your choice.Or, there’s Swedish designer Cornelia Webb‘s Molded collection, which takes the body’s very bone structure and skin texture as the jumping off point for a range of sculptural, minimal jewelry unlike anything you’ve seen before.While she’s based in Stockholm, Webb was in New York last month to celebrate the brand’s takeover of indie marketplace Tictail‘s Lower East Side boutique. There, the statement chokers and dramatic body chains that she made her name with during the first few years of her decade-long career were displayed alongside her newer, more delicate pieces: druzy drop earrings, rings inlaid with slices of granite, and necklaces molded to mimic the shape of the collarbone. Webb, a former medical student, doesn’t shy away from the human body: she’s used her own to make casts of thumbs, nipples, knuckles, ankles, and more, creating everything from silver-plated pendants to brass-and-marble rings.MORE: How to Wear the Biggest Jewelry Trend of Spring ’17 Right NowThe nipples, strung from chains to be worn around the neck, have been a particular hit—perhaps in part because it’s not immediately obvious what they are. “Women have seen [the nipple pendant] in magazines and been like, ‘What about that hat that you have?’ And we’ve been like, ‘Uhhh, we don’t really have a hat…’ This has been really popular with both men and women.”Not that her customers are prudes by any stretch. “When we started playing around with the metal waxes and casting the nipples, I did full breasts,” she recalls. “We’ve had requests for bespoke services from customers who are like, ‘Can you do my breasts now before I get old?'”Webb does, in fact, offer custom jewelry in addition to the ready-made pieces she sells at Tictail, Net-A-Porter, Harvey Nichols, and elsewhere—but, you do have to visit her in Stockholm, or else catch her at a stop like the one she made in New York for an appointment. There, she’ll make a cast of your chosen body part in wax, then bring it back to her workshop in Bali, Indonesia to hand-make the piece—and while bespoke items are pricier than her typical collections (which, for the most part, retail from around $35 to $250), they’re also guaranteed to be as unique as you are.Even if you can’t snag a custom piece, the personal element is present throughout Webb’s oeuvre—you’ll find a fingerprint or two on almost every piece, whether on the surface of a signet ring or the back clasp of a choker necklace. Not only does this give them a handcrafted feel you don’t get with mass-produced pieces, it also reinforces the human connection, which to the designer may be the most important part.“The more you wear jewelry, the more you’ll love it and the more important it becomes,” she says. Almost, you might say, like second skin.MORE: These Canadian Jewelry Designers Are Killing It Right Now 0Thoughts?1 of 9Cornelia Webb Folded Cuff, $191; at TictailCornelia Webb Wired Stone Body Chain, $191; at TictailCharmed Pinky Necklace, $191; at TictailCornelia Webb Molded Collarbones Cutout Necklace, $269; at TictailCornelia Webb Molded Signet Square Ring, $118; at TictailCornelia Webb Molded Wrist Medium Bracelet, $146; at TictailCornelia Webb Wired Spiral Earring, $107; at TictailMolded Knuckle Ring, $101; at TictailCornelia Webb Slized Ear Cuff, $64; at TictailNext slideshow starts in 10sHere Are the GigiHadid-Designed Boots That Are About to Sell Out "
"Birchbox Founders on Spring’s Top Trends, How to Take Hair from Day to Night","If anything, 2018 has exposed our collective affinity for retro revivals. Scrunchies, dad sneakers, year-round sequins and all kinds of other trends from decades past have made a significant comebacks—exiting the (mental and literal) attics we’d stored them in and pervading the sartorial zeitgeist, instead.The latest iteration of this trend? Chunky vintage jewelry—specifically, chunky, vintage-looking gold statement earrings—which offer contemporary maximalists the chance to pay homage to history while accessorizing their outfits in the trendiest, most over-the-top way possible.MORE:17 Faux Fur Jackets That Aren’t Too Extra to WearDailyAs a self-proclaimed maximalist who’s openly lamented not being born in the 1980s (purely for fashion purposes, of course), I’m more than on board with this immoderate movement.The sharp silhouettes of ’80s dresses are hard to beat, but the shoulder pads that come with them can seriously overwhelm an ensemble—that is, until you combine them with a pair of equally eye-catching gold statement earrings. (And some retro Madonna-worthy hair.) (And probably some incredible shoes, too.)Chunky gold earrings can hold their own in even the most head-turning of ensembles. They’re sparkly enough to catch your eye, big enough to warrant your attention and cool enough to demand respect when they do.
