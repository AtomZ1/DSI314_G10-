7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.December is here, and the month’s arrival offers the ideal time to try one of TikTok’s latest born-of-reality beauty trends: “I’m cold” or “cold girl” makeup, as dreamed up by creator Zoe Kim Kenealy and seen on stars like Hailey Bieber as of late. Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose. Top with a dusting ofDior Backstage Rosy Glow Blushfor extra pigment and a welcome seal.Rationale #1 The Serum$145 at NEIMAN MARCUSAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream$175 at NORDSTROMGiorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation$69 at NORDSTROMWestman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick$48 at NORDSTROMMost PopularweddingsThis Community-Effort Backyard Brooklyn Wedding Came Together in Under a WeekBy Emma Spectercelebrity-styleFlip-Flop Heels & Diamanté Dresses: Kendall Jenner’s Guide To PartywearBy Alice NewboldbeautyMargot Robbie Wears Winter’s Chicest Nail ColorBy Hannah CoatesThe luminous aspects of the trend come courtesy of highlighter, likeIlia’s Multi-Stick in Polka Dots and Moonbeams, dotted on the center and tip of the nose, as well as the cheekbones and cupid’s bow. Next, apply a sparkly off-white, champagne, or silvery eyeshadow (Pat McGrath’s Mothership Mega Palette in Celestial Nirvanaboasts several options) to the inner corner of the eyes and the center of the eyelids only for a frosted effect.

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"
7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.December is here, and the month’s arrival offers the ideal time to try one of TikTok’s latest born-of-reality beauty trends: “I’m cold” or “cold girl” makeup, as dreamed up by creator Zoe Kim Kenealy and seen on stars like Hailey Bieber as of late. Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose. Top with a dusting ofDior Backstage Rosy Glow Blushfor extra pigment and a welcome seal.Rationale #1 The Serum$145 at NEIMAN MARCUSAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream$175 at NORDSTROMGiorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation$69 at NORDSTROMWestman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick$48 at NORDSTROMMost PopularweddingsThis Community-Effort Backyard Brooklyn Wedding Came Together in Under a WeekBy Emma Spectercelebrity-styleFlip-Flop Heels & Diamanté Dresses: Kendall Jenner’s Guide To PartywearBy Alice NewboldbeautyMargot Robbie Wears Winter’s Chicest Nail ColorBy Hannah CoatesThe luminous aspects of the trend come courtesy of highlighter, likeIlia’s Multi-Stick in Polka Dots and Moonbeams, dotted on the center and tip of the nose, as well as the cheekbones and cupid’s bow.

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.December is here, and the month’s arrival offers the ideal time to try one of TikTok’s latest born-of-reality beauty trends: “I’m cold” or “cold girl” makeup, as dreamed up by creator Zoe Kim Kenealy and seen on stars like Hailey Bieber as of late. Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose. Top with a dusting ofDior Backstage Rosy Glow Blushfor extra pigment and a welcome seal.Rationale #1 The Serum$145 at NEIMAN MARCUSAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream$175 at NORDSTROMGiorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation$69 at NORDSTROMWestman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick$48 at NORDSTROMMost PopularweddingsThis Community-Effort Backyard Brooklyn Wedding Came Together in Under a WeekBy Emma Spectercelebrity-styleFlip-Flop Heels & Diamanté Dresses: Kendall Jenner’s Guide To PartywearBy Alice NewboldbeautyMargot Robbie Wears Winter’s Chicest Nail ColorBy Hannah CoatesThe luminous aspects of the trend come courtesy of highlighter, likeIlia’s Multi-Stick in Polka Dots and Moonbeams, dotted on the center and tip of the nose, as well as the cheekbones and cupid’s bow. Next, apply a sparkly off-white, champagne, or silvery eyeshadow (Pat McGrath’s Mothership Mega Palette in Celestial Nirvanaboasts several options) to the inner corner of the eyes and the center of the eyelids only for a frosted effect.

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.December is here, and the month’s arrival offers the ideal time to try one of TikTok’s latest born-of-reality beauty trends: “I’m cold” or “cold girl” makeup, as dreamed up by creator Zoe Kim Kenealy and seen on stars like Hailey Bieber as of late. Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose. Top with a dusting ofDior Backstage Rosy Glow Blushfor extra pigment and a welcome seal.Rationale #1 The Serum$145 at NEIMAN MARCUSAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream$175 at NORDSTROMGiorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation$69 at NORDSTROMWestman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick$48 at NORDSTROMMost PopularweddingsThis Community-Effort Backyard Brooklyn Wedding Came Together in Under a WeekBy Emma Spectercelebrity-styleFlip-Flop Heels & Diamanté Dresses: Kendall Jenner’s Guide To PartywearBy Alice NewboldbeautyMargot Robbie Wears Winter’s Chicest Nail ColorBy Hannah CoatesThe luminous aspects of the trend come courtesy of highlighter, likeIlia’s Multi-Stick in Polka Dots and Moonbeams, dotted on the center and tip of the nose, as well as the cheekbones and cupid’s bow. Next, apply a sparkly off-white, champagne, or silvery eyeshadow (Pat McGrath’s Mothership Mega Palette in Celestial Nirvanaboasts several options) to the inner corner of the eyes and the center of the eyelids only for a frosted effect.

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.December is here, and the month’s arrival offers the ideal time to try one of TikTok’s latest born-of-reality beauty trends: “I’m cold” or “cold girl” makeup, as dreamed up by creator Zoe Kim Kenealy and seen on stars like Hailey Bieber as of late. Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose. Top with a dusting ofDior Backstage Rosy Glow Blushfor extra pigment and a welcome seal.Rationale #1 The Serum$145 at NEIMAN MARCUSAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream$175 at NORDSTROMGiorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation$69 at NORDSTROMWestman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick$48 at NORDSTROMMost PopularweddingsThis Community-Effort Backyard Brooklyn Wedding Came Together in Under a WeekBy Emma Spectercelebrity-styleFlip-Flop Heels & Diamanté Dresses: Kendall Jenner’s Guide To PartywearBy Alice NewboldbeautyMargot Robbie Wears Winter’s Chicest Nail ColorBy Hannah CoatesThe luminous aspects of the trend come courtesy of highlighter, likeIlia’s Multi-Stick in Polka Dots and Moonbeams, dotted on the center and tip of the nose, as well as the cheekbones and cupid’s bow.

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

Now, muse Hailey Bieber has become one of the first to road-test Donatella’s new-season corsetry, fresh from the catwalk.The model and mogul orchestrated an Instagram photoshoot wearing look 12 from the collection: a satin corset mini dress with intricate boning skimming the chest, torso and side seams, embellished with bejeweled Medusa motifs on the straps.Hailey accessorized her look with layered Tiffany & Co. jewelry.
Instagram: @HaileybieberHailey’s chosen shade? Pink, of course, perfectly in line with the rise of Barbiecore. Stylist Karla Welch posted a picture of the model in her bubblegum look with the caption: “Paging the Barbie movie.”Nicola Peltz Beckham is another famous fan of Versace corsets. The actor, who incorporated a number of Versace looks into her wardrobe for her wedding celebrations, told Vogue at the time: “There’s just nothing that feels better than a Versace corset… The fit is impeccable. It makes you feel sexy, but classy at the same time. Versace is just the perfect thing to put on after a big bridal gown.”Versace autumn/winter 2022.

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

"Crafty, Earthy, and Intentional—Shop the Neo-Bohemian Trend","Vogue WorldCrafty, Earthy, and Intentional—Shop the Neo-Bohemian TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 12, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Photographed by Hunter AbramsFacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

In July, she sported a helmet to the fall 2022 Balenciaga haute couture dinner, fresh from the runway. (It also appeared on every model in the lookbook). TheAlien-esque headpiece was created in collaboration with Mercedes-AMG F1 Applied Science and retails for $6,000.As for this helmet bag, it is far less severe than the extreme headwear she wore this past summer.

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions. A hymn to rebirth and free self-expression.Sara Scanderebech

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic.

But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose.

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.December is here, and the month’s arrival offers the ideal time to try one of TikTok’s latest born-of-reality beauty trends: “I’m cold” or “cold girl” makeup, as dreamed up by creator Zoe Kim Kenealy and seen on stars like Hailey Bieber as of late. Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose. Top with a dusting ofDior Backstage Rosy Glow Blushfor extra pigment and a welcome seal.Rationale #1 The Serum$145 at NEIMAN MARCUSAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream$175 at NORDSTROMGiorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation$69 at NORDSTROMWestman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick$48 at NORDSTROMMost PopularweddingsThis Community-Effort Backyard Brooklyn Wedding Came Together in Under a WeekBy Emma Spectercelebrity-styleFlip-Flop Heels & Diamanté Dresses: Kendall Jenner’s Guide To PartywearBy Alice NewboldbeautyMargot Robbie Wears Winter’s Chicest Nail ColorBy Hannah CoatesThe luminous aspects of the trend come courtesy of highlighter, likeIlia’s Multi-Stick in Polka Dots and Moonbeams, dotted on the center and tip of the nose, as well as the cheekbones and cupid’s bow. Next, apply a sparkly off-white, champagne, or silvery eyeshadow (Pat McGrath’s Mothership Mega Palette in Celestial Nirvanaboasts several options) to the inner corner of the eyes and the center of the eyelids only for a frosted effect.

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.December is here, and the month’s arrival offers the ideal time to try one of TikTok’s latest born-of-reality beauty trends: “I’m cold” or “cold girl” makeup, as dreamed up by creator Zoe Kim Kenealy and seen on stars like Hailey Bieber as of late. Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose. Top with a dusting ofDior Backstage Rosy Glow Blushfor extra pigment and a welcome seal.Rationale #1 The Serum$145 at NEIMAN MARCUSAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream$175 at NORDSTROMGiorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation$69 at NORDSTROMWestman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick$48 at NORDSTROMMost PopularweddingsThis Community-Effort Backyard Brooklyn Wedding Came Together in Under a WeekBy Emma Spectercelebrity-styleFlip-Flop Heels & Diamanté Dresses: Kendall Jenner’s Guide To PartywearBy Alice NewboldbeautyMargot Robbie Wears Winter’s Chicest Nail ColorBy Hannah CoatesThe luminous aspects of the trend come courtesy of highlighter, likeIlia’s Multi-Stick in Polka Dots and Moonbeams, dotted on the center and tip of the nose, as well as the cheekbones and cupid’s bow. Next, apply a sparkly off-white, champagne, or silvery eyeshadow (Pat McGrath’s Mothership Mega Palette in Celestial Nirvanaboasts several options) to the inner corner of the eyes and the center of the eyelids only for a frosted effect.

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.December is here, and the month’s arrival offers the ideal time to try one of TikTok’s latest born-of-reality beauty trends: “I’m cold” or “cold girl” makeup, as dreamed up by creator Zoe Kim Kenealy and seen on stars like Hailey Bieber as of late. Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose. Top with a dusting ofDior Backstage Rosy Glow Blushfor extra pigment and a welcome seal.Rationale #1 The Serum$145 at NEIMAN MARCUSAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream$175 at NORDSTROMGiorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation$69 at NORDSTROMWestman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick$48 at NORDSTROMMost PopularweddingsThis Community-Effort Backyard Brooklyn Wedding Came Together in Under a WeekBy Emma Spectercelebrity-styleFlip-Flop Heels & Diamanté Dresses: Kendall Jenner’s Guide To PartywearBy Alice NewboldbeautyMargot Robbie Wears Winter’s Chicest Nail ColorBy Hannah CoatesThe luminous aspects of the trend come courtesy of highlighter, likeIlia’s Multi-Stick in Polka Dots and Moonbeams, dotted on the center and tip of the nose, as well as the cheekbones and cupid’s bow.

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

Now, muse Hailey Bieber has become one of the first to road-test Donatella’s new-season corsetry, fresh from the catwalk.The model and mogul orchestrated an Instagram photoshoot wearing look 12 from the collection: a satin corset mini dress with intricate boning skimming the chest, torso and side seams, embellished with bejeweled Medusa motifs on the straps.Hailey accessorized her look with layered Tiffany & Co. jewelry.
Instagram: @HaileybieberHailey’s chosen shade? Pink, of course, perfectly in line with the rise of Barbiecore. Stylist Karla Welch posted a picture of the model in her bubblegum look with the caption: “Paging the Barbie movie.”Nicola Peltz Beckham is another famous fan of Versace corsets. The actor, who incorporated a number of Versace looks into her wardrobe for her wedding celebrations, told Vogue at the time: “There’s just nothing that feels better than a Versace corset… The fit is impeccable. It makes you feel sexy, but classy at the same time. Versace is just the perfect thing to put on after a big bridal gown.”Versace autumn/winter 2022.

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

"Crafty, Earthy, and Intentional—Shop the Neo-Bohemian Trend","Vogue WorldCrafty, Earthy, and Intentional—Shop the Neo-Bohemian TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 12, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Photographed by Hunter AbramsFacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

In July, she sported a helmet to the fall 2022 Balenciaga haute couture dinner, fresh from the runway. (It also appeared on every model in the lookbook). TheAlien-esque headpiece was created in collaboration with Mercedes-AMG F1 Applied Science and retails for $6,000.As for this helmet bag, it is far less severe than the extreme headwear she wore this past summer.

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions. A hymn to rebirth and free self-expression.Sara Scanderebech

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic.

But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose.

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.December is here, and the month’s arrival offers the ideal time to try one of TikTok’s latest born-of-reality beauty trends: “I’m cold” or “cold girl” makeup, as dreamed up by creator Zoe Kim Kenealy and seen on stars like Hailey Bieber as of late. Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose. Top with a dusting ofDior Backstage Rosy Glow Blushfor extra pigment and a welcome seal.Rationale #1 The Serum$145 at NEIMAN MARCUSAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream$175 at NORDSTROMGiorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation$69 at NORDSTROMWestman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick$48 at NORDSTROMMost PopularweddingsThis Community-Effort Backyard Brooklyn Wedding Came Together in Under a WeekBy Emma Spectercelebrity-styleFlip-Flop Heels & Diamanté Dresses: Kendall Jenner’s Guide To PartywearBy Alice NewboldbeautyMargot Robbie Wears Winter’s Chicest Nail ColorBy Hannah CoatesThe luminous aspects of the trend come courtesy of highlighter, likeIlia’s Multi-Stick in Polka Dots and Moonbeams, dotted on the center and tip of the nose, as well as the cheekbones and cupid’s bow. Next, apply a sparkly off-white, champagne, or silvery eyeshadow (Pat McGrath’s Mothership Mega Palette in Celestial Nirvanaboasts several options) to the inner corner of the eyes and the center of the eyelids only for a frosted effect.

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.December is here, and the month’s arrival offers the ideal time to try one of TikTok’s latest born-of-reality beauty trends: “I’m cold” or “cold girl” makeup, as dreamed up by creator Zoe Kim Kenealy and seen on stars like Hailey Bieber as of late. Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose. Top with a dusting ofDior Backstage Rosy Glow Blushfor extra pigment and a welcome seal.Rationale #1 The Serum$145 at NEIMAN MARCUSAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream$175 at NORDSTROMGiorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation$69 at NORDSTROMWestman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick$48 at NORDSTROMMost PopularweddingsThis Community-Effort Backyard Brooklyn Wedding Came Together in Under a WeekBy Emma Spectercelebrity-styleFlip-Flop Heels & Diamanté Dresses: Kendall Jenner’s Guide To PartywearBy Alice NewboldbeautyMargot Robbie Wears Winter’s Chicest Nail ColorBy Hannah CoatesThe luminous aspects of the trend come courtesy of highlighter, likeIlia’s Multi-Stick in Polka Dots and Moonbeams, dotted on the center and tip of the nose, as well as the cheekbones and cupid’s bow. Next, apply a sparkly off-white, champagne, or silvery eyeshadow (Pat McGrath’s Mothership Mega Palette in Celestial Nirvanaboasts several options) to the inner corner of the eyes and the center of the eyelids only for a frosted effect.

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.December is here, and the month’s arrival offers the ideal time to try one of TikTok’s latest born-of-reality beauty trends: “I’m cold” or “cold girl” makeup, as dreamed up by creator Zoe Kim Kenealy and seen on stars like Hailey Bieber as of late. Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose. Top with a dusting ofDior Backstage Rosy Glow Blushfor extra pigment and a welcome seal.Rationale #1 The Serum$145 at NEIMAN MARCUSAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream$175 at NORDSTROMGiorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation$69 at NORDSTROMWestman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick$48 at NORDSTROMMost PopularweddingsThis Community-Effort Backyard Brooklyn Wedding Came Together in Under a WeekBy Emma Spectercelebrity-styleFlip-Flop Heels & Diamanté Dresses: Kendall Jenner’s Guide To PartywearBy Alice NewboldbeautyMargot Robbie Wears Winter’s Chicest Nail ColorBy Hannah CoatesThe luminous aspects of the trend come courtesy of highlighter, likeIlia’s Multi-Stick in Polka Dots and Moonbeams, dotted on the center and tip of the nose, as well as the cheekbones and cupid’s bow.

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

Now, muse Hailey Bieber has become one of the first to road-test Donatella’s new-season corsetry, fresh from the catwalk.The model and mogul orchestrated an Instagram photoshoot wearing look 12 from the collection: a satin corset mini dress with intricate boning skimming the chest, torso and side seams, embellished with bejeweled Medusa motifs on the straps.Hailey accessorized her look with layered Tiffany & Co. jewelry.
Instagram: @HaileybieberHailey’s chosen shade? Pink, of course, perfectly in line with the rise of Barbiecore. Stylist Karla Welch posted a picture of the model in her bubblegum look with the caption: “Paging the Barbie movie.”Nicola Peltz Beckham is another famous fan of Versace corsets. The actor, who incorporated a number of Versace looks into her wardrobe for her wedding celebrations, told Vogue at the time: “There’s just nothing that feels better than a Versace corset… The fit is impeccable. It makes you feel sexy, but classy at the same time. Versace is just the perfect thing to put on after a big bridal gown.”Versace autumn/winter 2022.

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

"Crafty, Earthy, and Intentional—Shop the Neo-Bohemian Trend","Vogue WorldCrafty, Earthy, and Intentional—Shop the Neo-Bohemian TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 12, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Photographed by Hunter AbramsFacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

In July, she sported a helmet to the fall 2022 Balenciaga haute couture dinner, fresh from the runway. (It also appeared on every model in the lookbook). TheAlien-esque headpiece was created in collaboration with Mercedes-AMG F1 Applied Science and retails for $6,000.As for this helmet bag, it is far less severe than the extreme headwear she wore this past summer.

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions. A hymn to rebirth and free self-expression.Sara Scanderebech

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic.

But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

The Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend Report,"RunwayThe Spring 2023 Jewelry Trend ReportBy José Criales-UnzuetaOctober 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Jewelry often plays a supporting role on the runways—a pretty ornament or a delicate detail, one you only notice after zooming in (or checking out the Details section on our Vogue Runway galleries). But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin

7 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewellery Collection That Were Once Worn by Diana,"Royals8 Meaningful Pieces From the New Princess Of Wales’s Jewelry Collection That Were Once Worn by DianaBy Emily ChanSeptember 14, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the new King Charles III confirmed that Prince William will now be known as the Prince of Wales, while his wife, Kate, becomes the Princess of Wales. As the first Princess of Wales since Diana (Camilla, the new Queen Consort, chose not to use the title), a Kensington Palace source said that Kate “appreciates the history associated with this role but will understandably want to look to the future as she creates her own path”.While the new Princess of Wales never got to meet Diana, the royal has often paid tribute to her through her jewelry—most notably, via the sapphire and diamond engagement ring that was famously worn by her late mother-in-law.Below, see the most meaningful pieces in Kate’s jewelry collection that were previously worn by Diana.Photos: Getty Images1/8The sapphire and diamond engagement ringArguably the most famous piece in Kate’s jewelry collection is her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which previously belonged to Princess Diana. After the then Prince Charles asked her to marry him, Diana hand-picked the ring—which features a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire encircled with a halo of diamonds set in 18-carat white gold—from royal jewelers Garrard back in 1981. Fittingly, Prince William proposed to Kate using his mother’s engagement ring in 2010. “It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well,” he said following their engagement. “It is only right the two are put together. It is my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today.”Photos: Getty Images2/8The double-drop sapphire and diamond earringsSapphires featured heavily in Princess Diana’s jewelry collection, which included a pair of double-drop sapphire earrings that were part of a suite gifted to her by the Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia when she married Prince Charles. For a long time, it was believed that the new Princess of Wales had refashioned the piece into a pair of single-drop earrings, which she is often seen wearing, in tribute to Diana. However, Kate was first seen wearing Diana’s original double-drop earrings, set with cabochon sapphires that are surrounded by diamonds, at the Trooping the Colour parade that marked the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Photos: Getty Images3/8The Lover’s Knot tiaraOriginally commissioned from Garrard for Queen Mary in 1917, the Lover’s Knot tiara—so-called because of the knots of diamonds that are historically a symbol of unbreakable love—was one of Princess Diana’s favorites. Based on the Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara, which belonged to Queen Mary’s aunt, the Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany, the diadem also features 19 hanging pearls and a row of diamonds (which were originally pearls) at the top, set in silver and gold. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara from her mother, before loaning it to Princess Diana in 1981. The new Princess of Wales has worn the Lover’s Knot tiara at a series of high-profile events, including at a state banquet for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in 2018.Photos: Getty Images4/8The diamond and South Sea pearl earringsPrincess Diana wore her diamond and South Sea pearl earrings—which feature a horseshoe design at the top and intricately-linked marquise-cut diamonds beneath—on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Australia in 1996. Kate was first photographed wearing the earrings at the BAFTA Awards in 2019, but with smaller pearls attached.Photos: Getty Images5/8The four-row pearl and diamond chokerMade by Garrard using pearls gifted to the Queen by the Japanese government, this four-row pearl choker—featuring a large diamond clasp at the center—was loaned to Princess Diana by Her Majesty for a state banquet in honor of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. Kate wore the choker for the first time at a dinner marking the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary in 2017. Most recently, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the necklace at Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.Photos: Getty Images6/8The three-row pearl and diamond braceletDesigned by Nigel Milne, Princess Diana’s three-row pearl bracelet had a special connection to one of her patronages: Birthright, a charity that was originally set up to stop women and babies dying in pregnancy and childbirth. The bracelet, which features pearl and diamond spacers, was part of a three-piece collection created in 1988to raise money for the charity, with Diana wearing it at the Birthright Ball in 1989. The new Princess of Wales has worn the piece on a number of occasions, including during a visit to Jamaica in May.Photos: Getty Images7/8The Collingwood pearl earringsGifted to Diana from Collingwood jewelers, these pearl drop earrings—which hang from two round diamonds at the top and three rows of smaller diamonds underneath—were famously worn by the then Princess of Wales as part of her going away outfit, following her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. She also wore the earrings at an evening reception in Hong Kong in 1989, along with a beaded white Catherine Walker gown dubbed the Elvis dress. The Collingwood pearl earrings are a favorite for Kate, too, with the Duchess wearing them in two of her 40th birthday portraits taken by Paolo Roversi in November 2021 and unveiled in January.TopicsKate MiddletonPrincess DianaJewelryRead MoreroyalsThe Princess of Wales’s Dazzling State Dinner Outfit Honored Both Princess Diana and the QueenBy Elise Taylorcelebrity-styleThe Prince and Princess of Wales’s Matching Suits Send a MessageBy André-Naquian Wheelercelebrity-styleKate Middleton Kicks Off Festive Season in a Burgundy Coat DressBy Alice CaryroyalsThe Princess of Wales Wears Princess Diana’s Earrings to Remembrance DayBy VoguefashionA Detailed Look at the Princess of Wales’s Boston WardrobeBy Kerry McDermotttv-and-moviesThe Essential Princess Diana Documentaries to Watch After The CrownBy Radhika Seth"
Stylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic Collab,"JewelleryStylist Kate Young’s Vintage Jewellery Obsession Inspired This Chic CollabBy Rachel GarrahanSeptember 2, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Celebrity stylist Kate Young has created some of the most iconic looks we’ve seen on the red carpet in recent memory, and knows better than anyone how jewelry can provide the perfect finishing touch to a showstopping look. At this year’s SAG Awards, she dressed Selena Gomez in a dazzling Bulgari Serpenti choker. At the BAFTAs, Sienna Miller embodied effortless chic in diamond tassels by Boucheron. And who could forget Margot Robbie in her Van Cleef & Arpels Zip necklace at the 2015 Oscars?Fortunately, you no longer need a Hollywood star’s bank balance to benefit from this self-confessed jewelry geek’s expertise. The New York-based stylist has drawn on her own enviable collection of vintage baubles to create a collection with Monica Vinader. The hardworking pair of entrepreneurial creatives were introduced by a mutual friend, and got to Zooming during lockdown when the lack of travel and red-carpet events meant they had the time to devote to designing a collection together.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Vinader says she knew it was a match made in heaven from their very first video call. “You said, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m just going to go to my safe.’ And you literally turned around and started showing us your jewelry box with all your amazing collection – your vintage pieces and the things you loved,” Vinader told Young during an exclusive conversation with Vogue.“I love fashion, but it can be so transient. Things that look important can look really tired a year and half later. Jewelry doesn’t do that,” says Young, who counts Elsa Peretti among her favorite designers. One of the best things about awards season, she says, is seeing the look on the faces of new interns when they unpack a diamond necklace for the first time. “They cannot believe their eyes – there’s a magic in those rocks,” she says with a smile.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
Inspiration for the Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection came from a mixture of vintage jewelry, modernist architecture, and sculpture, as well as, of course, fashion. “Currently, I’m really inspired by that sort of early 2000s minimalism, that Donna Karen/Armani-style modernism,” says Young. The result is a sleek, sculptural amalgam of earrings, necklaces, bangles, and rings in high-shine gold vermeil, paired with a striking palette of lemon quartz and black and green onyx. A testament to the timelessness of strong design, Vinader credits her goldsmiths’ expertise with bringing the pair’s vision to life. “Simplicity, it turns out, is complicated!” she says, laughing.One bangle is a perfectly satisfying seamless curve of gold and black. It can be worn alone or stacked with others. “Wear the bangles in all gold, and they look really minimal, but if you stack them in different colors, they become cool and conceptual,” says Young. The tennis necklaces, meanwhile, inspired by the stylist’s love of paste jewelry, can be layered to create your very own neck mess.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection

Obsessed from a young age, she would go straight to the fashion section at the library when her mother took her to storytime sessions. But it was only while working as an assistant at US Vogue in the early 2000s that she started to learn about jewelry, too. She would frequently be sent to pick up pieces for shoots from Fred Leighton, and while there, would soak up knowledge from the store’s Rebecca Selva, its resident expert in antique sparkle. “I would ask her about the pieces in the store and she would tell me about their history, and give me books to go away and learn more,” Young recalls.The Monica Vinader X Kate Young collection
That knowledge and passion comes through in the collection, and is what Vinader herself loves best about collaborating with creatives in other fields. “They always push us to try new things and to think about design in a different way,” she says. The result of this particular partnership is one that will benefit all of our wardrobes this autumn.Kate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone bangle$850 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone small hoop earrings$295 at MONICA VINADERKate Young bangle$750 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone tennis necklace$675 at MONICA VINADERKate Young gemstone ring$225 at MONICA VINADERTopicsJewelrySign up for our weekly shopping newsletter, The Get!The insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MorebeautySelena Gomez Experiments With The “Skittle” Nail TrendBy Hannah Coatescelebrity-styleRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse Make Their First Red Carpet Appearance in StyleBy Christian AllairebeautyCatherine Zeta-Jones Serves Up Sultry Morticia Addams-Inspired Beauty on the Red CarpetBy Hannah Coatestrends6 Fall Fashion Trends That Are Celebrity-ApprovedBy Christian AllairetrendsStatement Trenches Are This Season’s Celebrity Must-HaveBy Christian Allairecelebrity-styleThe Best Celebrity Outfits of 2022, According toVogue EditorsBy Vogue"

Precisely as alluded to by the photograph taken by Sara Scanderebech, which features a refined creation in white diamonds by Crivelli, a Made in Italy high-end jewellery brand, a symbol of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail. Wearing Crivelli’s precious stones is the elegant actress Roberta Maria Mattei: a woman with a gaze that is at once intense, sweet and proud. Her figure emerges from coloured waters, in photographer Sara Scanderebech’s original vision, and radiates light thanks to Crivelli’s refined compositions.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Most are familiar with the heavy hitters of bohemian fashion—think frizzling fringes, floral prints, patchwork, crochet, tie-dyes, and more—but on the runway this fall, the trend took on a neo-bohemian twist with an emphasis on glamour and elegance. There were still elements of classic craft-core throughout, including homespun fabrics and patterns of paisley, which felt reminiscent of the flower children of yore. But a neo-bohemian fashion renaissance has commenced thanks to a crop of designers who have made the style their signature like Etro, Chloé, Ulla Johnson, Sea, Zimmermann, and more. It was also a trend highlighted in our very own VOGUE World: New York runway.There’s much to like about the neo-bohemian approach, but first and foremost, it’s birthed from the desire and intent to empower sustainable design practices and artisans from around the globe. From sleek suedes and knit maxi dresses to Western cowboy boots and dressed-up denim, this crafty, earthy, and very much intentional trend is for the modern woman who celebrates her festive, bohemian spirit.Photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comPhoto: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comJohanna Ortiz, another designer channeling her expertise in bohemian glamour, creates richly woven patterns and prints that timelessly transcend seasons and occasions. For example, her Artful Dreams cotton midi dress is crafted to perfection with a flattering, figure-skimming silhouette and a scoop neckline. Style the sheath with a pair of ivory suede boots from Khaite. A matching patchwork suede jacket and miniskirt from Rixo features an array of autumnal colors—continue the retro feeling in Ganni’s wooden clogs. When it comes to boho-inspired outerwear, the shaggier, the better. Case in point is Saks Potts’ Foxy leather coat and Acne Studios’ shearling jacket, starring orange shaggy lapels. Ulla Johnson interprets the trend with a pair of beaded ballerina flats. Style the sweet shoe with flared jeans by Etro or an all-in-one-outfit dress from Sea, Paco Rabanne, or Gabriela Hearst. Accessorize with a raffia bag by Chloé and a pearl necklace by Chopova Lowena.Below, the 20 best bohemian fashion pieces to shop in 2022 to join in on the free-spirited festivity.Nili Lotan Justine suede jacket$2,395 at MATCHESFASHIONJohanna Ortiz Artful Dream midi dress$1,250 at MODA OPERANDISaks Potts Foxy leather coat$1,625 at SSENSEReformation Olive Western boots$498 at THE REFORMATIONSea Nohr patchwork midi dress$395 at NORDSTROMChopova Lowena pearl pendant necklace$350 at SSENSERixo Dionne patchwork jacket$499 at MYTHERESARixo Corfu patchwork miniskirt$370 at MYTHERESAZimmermann Kaleidoscope floral midi dress$1,150 at MATCHESFASHIONKhaite Dallas suede boots$1,380 at NET-A-PORTERPaco Rabanne cotton T-shirt$300 at SSENSEEtro paisley flared jeans$890 at MYTHERESAUlla Johnson Margaux suede midi skirt$1,795 at MODA OPERANDIChloé Marcie tote bag$650 at MATCHESFASHIONPaco Rabanne paisley midi dress$990 at MATCHESFASHIONSea Diego patchwork denim pants$375 at MODA OPERANDIUlla Johnson Eliza beaded ballerina flats$550 at BERGDORF GOODMANAcne Studios shearling jacket$2,300 at MYTHERESAGabriela Hearst Hank striped dress$2,490 at MATCHESFASHIONGanni Retro clogs$425 at NORDSTROMShop the VOGUE World Runway5 Fall Trends to Know About Now—As Seen on the VOGUE World: New York RunwayMidi Skirts, Nipped Waists, and Polka Dots—Shop Fall’s Retro TrendMix Sport and Style With Fall’s Athluxury Trend—Shop the Coolest Pieces From Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and MoreSequins!

Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose.

29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest Trend,"Fashion29 Ways to Test Drive Fall’s Sweater Vest TrendBy Laura JacksonSeptember 20, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Courtesy of Getty Images.FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.The well-polished silhouettes seen throughout the fall 2022 collections were hard to miss—think tailored-to-perfection suiting and a mix of sleek separates that work well when layered or otherwise. One layering essential we’re specifically standing behind this fall is as smart as it is stylish: sweater vests.In all their forms, sweater vests are having a resurgence—the sweater vest trend was even spotted on several stylish showgoers during this season’s New York Fashion Week. From the high street to the ultra-luxe, designers are also leaning into the sleeveless style. Colorful striped sweater vests from Chloé and Acne Studios’ are instantly uplifting. Sweater vests with a 1970s flare come courtesy of Wales Bonner, Re/Done, and Sea. While Preppy, varsity-style sweater vests from Purdey, Alessandra Rich, and Mango come complete with retro V-necks and argyle prints to really lean into the retro-to-wear trend.Plus, sweater vests aren’t picky layering companions. Loose or fitted, cropped or longline, plain or patterned, they tend to go with everything. Throw a well-loved tee underneath a sweater vest for a casual-yet-polished look; insulate button-ups with a sweater vest on top for more dressed-up days; wear one on its own indoors, or top off fitted turtlenecks on the coldest days.Turns out the sleeveless silhouette is as practical as it is a forever classic. Here, try on the sweater vest trend this fall with 29 sweater vests that are stylishly smart and seemingly sported by all.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

But jewelry also says much about a person and their style: minimal or maximalist; adventurous or reserved. It offers insight into what a person prioritizes and is interested in, be it nature with crystals and sustainable materials, or family and craft, as exemplified by antique relics and hand-made trinkets.This season’s top ready-to-wear trends reflect the world around us, while the common denominators found in footwear and handbags encourage us to free our minds and accessorize boldly. The jewelry from the collections offers insight into what’s deemed in at the moment, and what’s in tastemakers’ minds.Logomania in the form of branded chokers, earrings, and rings turned up at Chanel and Fendi, while our desire for human touch came alive in DIY-like objects at Tory Burch and Chopova Lowena. Waist-chains and body jewelry at Stella McCartney and Nensi Dojaka offered an update to the sexy cutouts and bodycon styles that have been dominating recent runways, while punk chains, studs, and spikes at Acne Studios and Balenciaga pointed a grungy way forward from the Y2K craze.Flowers and surfer motifs emphasized a collective interest in nature, as did shells and and raw stones, set in metal or paired with delicate chains and beads. Elsewhere, fashion’s artistic inclinations came through in astonishing statement hoops, wire-like sculptures, and extra-long fringe earrings, elevating the body to a walking canvas.Here, 12 jewelry trends that synthesize fashion today.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Body Heat1 / 25ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comStella McCartneyDIY But Make It Fashion1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTory BurchFemme Fleurs1 / 24ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comPradaName Game1 / 11ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comChanelOn the Fringe1 / 10ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comGucciWired Up1 / 12ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comBalmainThe Tide Is High1 / 8ChevronChevronPhoto: photo: Isidore Montag / Gorunway.comDavid KomaUncut Gems1 / 20ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comLouis VuittonPunk’s Not Dead1 / 9ChevronChevronPhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comPaco RabannePhoto: Andrea Adriani/ Gorunway.comThe Girls With Pearl Earrings1 / 13ChevronChevronPhoto: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.comJunya WatanabeHeart to Heart1 / 10ChevronChevronArmando Grillo / Gorunway.comVersaceJumping Through Hoops1 / 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.comTom FordVogue RunwayThe epicenter of runway news, street style, and emerging trends.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayThe Spring 2023 Trends Reflect the World Around UsBy Laird Borrelli-PerssonRunway10 Accessory Trends to Free Your Mind for Spring 2023By Laia Garcia-FurtadoRunwayA Guide to Menswear at the Spring 2023 Womenswear ShowsBy José Criales-UnzuetaRunwayAll the Street Style Trends From the Spring 2023 ShowsBy Irene KimfashionNeed to Know Now: The Vogue Jewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsBy Charlotte Diamondfashion17 Contemporary Jewelry Labels to Invest In NowBy Daisy Shaw-Ellis"

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.December is here, and the month’s arrival offers the ideal time to try one of TikTok’s latest born-of-reality beauty trends: “I’m cold” or “cold girl” makeup, as dreamed up by creator Zoe Kim Kenealy and seen on stars like Hailey Bieber as of late. Much like thesunburn blushthat freckled feeds earlier this year, this look centers the sweeter aspects of windchill, the effects of the elements mimicked with a blush pulled across cheeks and nose, a touch of shimmer at the inner corners of the eyes, and a glassy lip.Photo: Zoe Kim Kenealy / @zoekimkenealy“I think the pink flush to cheeks is always so beautiful in the colder months,” says makeup artistTobi Henney. “It definitely suits everyone and can look great worn with winter coats, beanies, and scarves.” Makeup artistCarolina Dalí-Trites, a devotee of the eye-catching eye moment, agrees, citing nostalgia as the force behind the trend—and championing its transportation nature. “You can take your beauty look from the sunshine of L.A. to the Austrian Alps without needing to hop on a plane,” she says. “Think après-ski. So chic.”Photo: Sagal Jama / @sagsznFor those interested in trying their hand at a faux-cold look, start with a round of hydration—the better to show off the frosted detailing to come. Henney recommendsRationale’s #1 The Serumfollowed byThe Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, withArmani Luminous Silkfor flawless coverage. Now, it’s time for blush. “Once you’re done concealing and sculpting, using a cream blush brush, apply a pink rosy cream blush (likeWestman Atelier’s Baby Cheeks Blush Stick) to the highest point of the cheekbone, blending upwards and a touch into your nose connecting both sides,” instructs Dalí-Trites, adding that you should concentrate color, though subtly, at the nose. Top with a dusting ofDior Backstage Rosy Glow Blushfor extra pigment and a welcome seal.Rationale #1 The Serum$145 at NEIMAN MARCUSAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream$175 at NORDSTROMGiorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation$69 at NORDSTROMWestman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick$48 at NORDSTROMMost PopularweddingsThis Community-Effort Backyard Brooklyn Wedding Came Together in Under a WeekBy Emma Spectercelebrity-styleFlip-Flop Heels & Diamanté Dresses: Kendall Jenner’s Guide To PartywearBy Alice NewboldbeautyMargot Robbie Wears Winter’s Chicest Nail ColorBy Hannah CoatesThe luminous aspects of the trend come courtesy of highlighter, likeIlia’s Multi-Stick in Polka Dots and Moonbeams, dotted on the center and tip of the nose, as well as the cheekbones and cupid’s bow. Next, apply a sparkly off-white, champagne, or silvery eyeshadow (Pat McGrath’s Mothership Mega Palette in Celestial Nirvanaboasts several options) to the inner corner of the eyes and the center of the eyelids only for a frosted effect.

The Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to Stay,"FashionThe Puff-Sleeve Trend Is Here to StayBy Madeline FassJuly 19, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StorySave this story for later.Photographed by Daniel Jackson, Vogue, April 2020When we started to see the puff-sleeve trend pop up in spring 2018, it seemed like just the season’s newest must-have. Since then, it’s been reimagined in so many iterations and has continually returned season after season; it’s become more than just a fleeting trend and a style with lasting power. Today, we see the larger-than-life sleeve present itself in many variations: the balloon, the Juliet, the leg-of-mutton, and so on. It was first seen fixed to Victorian-inspired shirts and romantic house dresses, but the market has since expanded (pun intended) to anything that has a sleeve. We saw it again shortly after in the fall/winter 2020 collections. There were mighty balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.Miu Miu Fall 2020; Alexander McQueen Fall 2020; Fendi Fall 2020; Paco Rabanne Fall 2020; Gabriela Hearst Fall 2020; Rodarte Fall 2020Photo: GoRunway.comWhether you’ve had enough of the oversized sleeve or not, we can certainly expect these statement sleeves to stick around for plenty more seasons to come, at the very least. And as far as shopping for a “trendy” item goes, ones with proven staying power feel like a smarter investment. For summer, you’d probably want a billowing dress in a breezy fabric. It is the season of the day dress, after all. And come fall, look to the Pre Fall and Resort 2023 collections from Erdem, Carolina Herrera, Ulla Johnson, and Gucci for more proof.Erdem Pre Fall 2023; Carolina Herrera Fall 2022; Ulla Johnson Resort 2023; Gucci Resort 2023Photo: Sarah Piantadosi / Courtesy or Erdem; Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com; Photo: Julia Noni / Courtesy of Ulla Johnson; Photo: Salvatore Dragone / Gorunway.comFind 19 versions of the puff sleeve you can wear right now, and save for later too.All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

Champagne wishes and cabana dreams, in other words.For snowbirds, there are garments infused with a tropical vibe communicated through colors—rainbow brights and sunset hues—as well as novelty prints, many featuring exotic blooms and palm fronds.The Americana tropes of the 1950s that were so prevalent in the spring menswear collections take the form of deb dresses and khakis that riff on GI favorites. Leather makes its way into the collections via the moto jacket, popularized by Marlon Brando in the 1953 classic The Wild One.Cotton shirting and shirred jersey are prevalent, as are tweedy suits featuring abbreviated jackets and micro-minis or shorts. Countering the ironic takes on “lady” dressing are Goth looks in black that take the LBD in a moodier direction that befits the times.ROYGBIVCelebrate Pride all year round.Rosie Assoulin
